07/06/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
7/6/2020)(jbo) (Entered: 07/06/2020)

(Rossmiller, Alex) (Entered: 07/07/2020)
07/07/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page7 of 91

and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page8 of 91

then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be
followed that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:
(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be

MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 60 Letter filed by USA as
to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page15 of 91

instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

sealed (or redacted). Alternatively, the Defendant may file the letter on the public
docket by that date. The Court will take no action on the request pending resolution of
the initial sealing question. The Defendant's letter and this memorandum endorsement
will be temporarily sealed pending resolution of the sealing request. (Signed by Judge

12/08/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all
necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant continues to receive adequate access to
her legal materials and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. (Signed by

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated

against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency'
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). As with the
redactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrowly
tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties
personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467
(S.D.N.Y. 2017). See also Dkt. No. 95. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket

2020. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/23/2020) (lnl)

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

Bobbi) (Entered: 03/16/2021)
03/18/2021
168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees

171 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 160
THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page24 of 91

subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

the redactions on pages 129134. However, for the reasons stated in the Court's March
29, 2021 Order, the information is already part of the public record in this case and
accordingly the proposed redactions are unnecessary and overbroad. Dkt. No. 189; see

Government's brief, except for the language quoted in the Indictment, which is already
part of the public record. The Government is therefore ORDERED to docket its
omnibus memorandum of law, along with the corresponding exhibits, by 3:00 p.m.
today, consistent with the Court's orders regarding redactions. The parties are further
ORDERED to docket their April 1, 2021 joint letter; if either side believes that
portions of that letter should be redacted, they shall propose redactions by April 19,

205 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 15, 2021, the Defendant filed under seal
her reply briefs to the Government memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve
pre−trial motions. She filed the briefs, along with the corresponding exhibits,
temporarily under seal in order to permit the Government and the Court to review
certain proposed redactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11,
and 12 did not contain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10
contain limited proposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and 10 also contain exhibits
that the Defendant proposes be filed under seal. As set forth in the Defendant's cover
letter, the premise of the proposed redactions is that the materials were produced in
discovery and subject to the protective order that has been entered in this case. The
mere existence of a confidentiality agreement or a protective order covering judicial
documents is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi Nissay
Dowa Ins. Co. v. Prosight Specialty Mgmt. Co., Inc., 12−cv−3274 (JPO), 2012 WL
3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012). And the Court did not receive specific
requests or justifications to redact or seal any of the materials. The Defendant is
ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 on ECF today, as she did
not propose any redactions to these and the Government has not voiced any opposition
to these being filed without redactions. If either side is seeking these or any other
redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they must file a letter indicating the redactions
they request and providing specific justifications for the sealing requests or redactions,
in line with the principles set forth in Lugosch. By April 20, 2021, the parties shall
confer and submit a letter informing the Court whether any redactions are being
sought. If no redactions are being sought, the Defendant is ORDERED to docket the
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page28 of 91

206 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 143
MOTION to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Superseding Indictment as
Time−Barred. . (Everdell, Christian) (Entered: 04/16/2021)
04/16/2021
207 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2020, a grand jury returned a
six−count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 1994 to 1997. The
Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which
contained only small, ministerial corrections. The S1 superseding indictment included
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in
violation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It
also included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil
deposition. Trial is set to begin on July 12, 2021. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial
motions seeking to dismiss portions of the S1 superseding indictment, suppress
evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand
jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and
another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently
pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the
Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with
the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added
sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's
motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further
expedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its
reasoning on the pages that follow:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...
Conclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as
barred by Epstein's non−prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann
Act counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the
indictment for pre−indictment delay (Dkt. No. 137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts
for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable
(Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to dismiss count one or count three
as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. 147).
The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial
(Dkt. No. 119). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week
whether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non−prosecution
agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 16 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or
will disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final
schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,
and Jenks Act materials, including co−conspirator statements; non−testifying witness
statements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the
indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires
the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing
in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submitted by
April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective
proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why
her motion to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.
No. 125) should not be denied as moot. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

216 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the
Defendant's motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part and
granted the Defendant' s motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt.
No. 207. The Court will try the non−perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its
Opinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See
Dkt. Nos. 133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government
obtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her
rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self−incrimination, and to
due process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to
determine whether the Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an
order modifying the protective order. The Court requires information from the
Government for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the
Court by letter docketed on ECF no later than April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use
any of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the
non−perjury counts in this case. If the Government does not intend to use any of the
documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the non−perjury
counts, the Court will defer consideration of those motions until it has scheduled the
trial of the perjury counts. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

Thursday, April 22, 2021: 1. Does defense counsel continue to seek an adjournment of
the July 12th start date for trial on the non−perjury counts? 2. If the answer to question
is yes, what is the specific request being made as to length of adjournment? In
particular, is the request for a 90−day adjournment? An adjournment until January
2022? Or something else? The Court requires a specific request be made and justified
or it will not be considered. If Maxwell continues to seek an adjournment, the
Government may submit any response by 5:00 pm on April 22, 2021. The Court will
consider the submissions and resolve expeditiously. As noted, however, unless and
until an adjournment is specifically requested and granted, the parties shall assume that

Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene
Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 20, 2021 re:
Redactions to Defense Reply Briefs and Exhibits. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants
the Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided
by the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes
that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law
presumptions of access attach. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, however, the Court finds that the specific arguments the
Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy
interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions.
See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). The Government's
letter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By April 23, 2021, the parties shall
either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6, which was originally filed
under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no redactions and file it on

seal with proposed redactions. The proposed redactions are GRANTED. The Court's
conclusion is guided by the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test,
the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial

the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. In balancing
competing considerations against the presumption of access, however, the Court finds
that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of
defense lawyers' clients in other matters and to allow defense counsel to comply with
their professional obligations under the rules of professional conduct. The Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the redacted version of her letter by April 23, 2021. The

264 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On April 21, 2021, the Court's Chambers received a
letter from counsel for a non−party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for
his client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The letter requests anonymity on
behalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the letter,
the Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to
counsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 21,
2021 letter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non−party
asserting that interest. The Government is requested to forward this order to counsel
for the non−party. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/3/21)(jbo)
(Entered: 05/03/2021)
05/03/2021
265 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has received an exchange of letters that
pertain to an incident that took place on April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,
259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her
lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an
in−person attorney−client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers
categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff
based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no
views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of
either sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure
that the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in
confidential attorney−client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that
obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the
defenses first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause why
the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted
in part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to
certain questions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to
ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer−client communications. Dkt. No.
255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over
copies of video tapes of the in−person attorney−client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video
tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248,
Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of
those materials as a matter of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense
counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is
denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the
opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all
relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates
in BOP custody. The isolated incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page36 of 91

serious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way
undermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to
prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize the importance of this
going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. In furtherance of this, counsel for
the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal counsel for MDC to ensure that
Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney−client communications
as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel shall
promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek
to resolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails,
the parties may write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and
justifying any specific application being made. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

266 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice
justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021
to be reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient
time to prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2
indictment while also ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No
additional delay is necessary or in the interests of justice. The parties are hereby
ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 2021, they shall jointly propose a trial
start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office (as is required by COVID
protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest possible date this fall and to
seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an early fall trial start date.
The parties shall also discuss and propose any adjustments necessary to the pre−trial
schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government may move in the letter for any
requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

268 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 30, 2021, defense counsel requested that
the Court issue an order directing the MDC to accept two hard drives from defense
counsel that contain the non−Highly Confidential discovery in this case for Ms.
Maxwell's use. Dkt. No. 260. On May 4, 2021, the Court received the attached email
from MDC legal counsel indicating that MDC does not oppose the defense's request
and that MDC staff will coordinate with defense counsel so that Ms. Maxwell can
receive the hard drives. In light of this, defense counsel's April 30, 2021 request
appears moot. Defense counsel shall raise any further issues regarding their request
within two weeks of this order. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/4/2021) (ap)

Bobbi) (Entered: 05/11/2021)
05/11/2021
277 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has considered the parties' proposals
regarding the commencement of trial. Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the
Government's letter, the Court will request November 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office
as the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office
consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to
the jury. However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury
selection occur during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The
Court grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021. The
Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial
computations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh
the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is
necessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in
light of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in
limine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to
allow adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded
under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021. In
order to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will
adjust the current pre−trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in
advance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be
fully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial
commencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose
adjustments to other pre−trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby
ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 30 minutes by phone regarding the overall
pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint letter by May 14, 2021. The Court will
accept only a joint letter with a joint proposal or with each sides views briefly stated.
The letter must attest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed letters will be struck.

The request for an extension of time until May 21, 2021 to respond to the Court's May
11, 2021 Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
5/14/2021) (lnl) (Entered: 05/14/2021)
05/14/2021
282 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell
wrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with
particular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other
factual showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every 15
minutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance
in Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to
prepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the
Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to
certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff
conduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As
reported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing
Unit are checked with flashlights every 30 minutes. Inmates housed with others in the
general population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The
Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the
ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.
As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's
flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,
including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential
stress for inmates that can arise in high−profile cases. The MDC has determined that
these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government
also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but
that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her
eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override
BOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check
procedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.
Certainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere
with Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.
Defense counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances
but makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the
Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be
reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to
ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines
are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre−trial detainees. The
Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for
the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/14/2021) (lnl)

05/17/2021
284 MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 278 Letter Proposed
Redactions to Defendant's Supplemental Pre−Trial Motions... ENDORSEMENT: The
Court grants in part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is
guided by the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court concludes that these are
judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of
access attach. Id. at 11920. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put
forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties
and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v.
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page39 of 91

Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). Similarly, the Court concludes that the
Government has shown that Exhibits E, F, G, H, and I should be filed under seal. With
respect to Exhibit C, however, the Court concludes that narrowly tailored redactions
are sufficient to advance the privacy interests the Government has identified.
Accordingly, the Government is ORDERED to confer with defense counsel and
submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

303 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell's motions to suppress evidence (Dkt. Nos.

filed under temporary seal to allow Maxwell and the Government the opportunity to
propose redactions. The parties may file under seal any proposed redactions to the
opinion within three days. The Court further ORDERS that the April 9, 2019
memorandum decision and order on the Government's application to modify the
protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15−cv−7433, as well as the transcripts of
the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that application shall be
unsealed. These documents were previously filed under seal as Exhibits D, E, F, and G
to the memorandum of law in support of Maxwell's first motion to suppress (Dkt. No.
134). Within one week, the parties shall confer and file under seal any proposed
redactions to the memorandum decision, order, and transcripts. Any proposed
redactions shall be narrowly tailored and shall be supported with reference to the
Second Circuit's opinion in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d
Cir. 2006). The parties proposed redactions should not include any information that

other specific or supported application for relief from the Defendant, the Court will
take no further action at this time. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

06/25/2021
307 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell moves to suppress evidence
obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation
against her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were
previously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of
her rights against compelled self−incrimination, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the
Government did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence
covered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is
not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus
DENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. 133, 139) (Signed by Judge Alison
J. Nathan on 6/25/21)(jw) (Entered: 07/01/2021)
06/30/2021
305 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2021 (Dkt.

suppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 30, 2021. Any proposed
redactions to the other documents ordered unsealed in that order must be filed no later
than July 2, 2021. The parties shall file a joint letter by each of these dates informing
the Court if no redactions are sought. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

314 LETTER addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from David Oscar Markus dated 7/9/21
re: The Governments request should be denied because (1) undersigned counsel does

(jw) (Entered: 07/12/2021)
07/30/2021
315 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government has moved for an order requiring
David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op−ed that he
authored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 309. Mr. Markus is
therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1. The Government does
not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op−ed and the Court declines
to consider whether it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack of clarity with respect
to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule
provides illustrative examples of statements that "presumptively involve a substantial
likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise
prejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule." S.D.N.Y.
Local Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated
with the pending case are now clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the
purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.1. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to
Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel[,] agents for the parties and
counsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair
trial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal matters
heading toward trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those
associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they
risk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of
the upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the
impact it could have on this matter, failure to comply could also result in attorney
discipline. Id. Rule 23.1(i). (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/21)(jw)

318 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 19, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted a sealed and ex parte motion for an order authorizing four subpoenas
pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. By sealed order
dated March 22, 2021, the Court provided an opportunity for recipients of the
subpoenas to respond to the requests by March 30, 2021, but it received no responses.
In an Opinion and Order temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES Maxwell's
motion without prejudice. It does so after concluding that none of the proposed
subpoenas conform to the factors first set out in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683,
69870 (1974). The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion and Order to
defense counsel. By August 18, 2021, Maxwell is ORDERED to inform the Court
whether she seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Court's opinion and of her
original motion papers, justifying any such request by reference to the three−part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d
110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date Maxwell shall inform the Court whether
she seeks full sealing or redactions of the original motion, again justifying any such
request by reference to the Lugosch test. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

DENIED without prejudice. She may renew any Rule 17(c) applications upon a proper
showing that each of the requested materials satisfies the Nixon test, as described
above and in the Court's April 27, 2021 and June 2, 2021 Orders. The Court will file
this Opinion & Order under temporary seal to allow consideration of any sealing or
redaction requests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 8/13/2021) (See ORDER set

329 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant submitted a letter on August 18
informing the Court about disruptions of attorney−client video teleconferences. Dkt.
No. 319. After conferring with MDC Legal, the Government responded on August 23.
Dkt. No. 326. According to the Government and MDC Legal, the Defendant's
difficulties in communicating with her counsel via video teleconference have been
resolved, and the Government's letter sufficiently addresses her other requests. The
Court finds MDC Legal's assurance that Defendant's communications have not been
interfered with, recorded, or listened to sufficient. No further application for relief was
made in Defendant's August 24 reply. Dkt. No. 327. The Court remains confident that
Ms. Maxwell is fully able to communicate with her defense counsel and to prepare for
trial. If Defendant experiences further issues in communicating with her counsel, she
should promptly notify the Court after conferring in good faith with the Government
and MDC Legal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 8/25/21)(jw) (Entered:

337 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is currently in the process of planning
logistics for trial in this matter and requires the parties' best and current estimate of
length of trial. The Court plans to have the jury sit 5 days a week from 9am until 5pm.
Given that jury selection will be complete by November 19 and opening statements
will occur on November 29, the Court requests that the parties provide their best
estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. This will allow the Court
to assess the likelihood that trial may continue after the Christmas holiday and
therefore whether the jury may be required to sit some days during the week between
Christmas and New Year's Day. Accordingly, on or before October 12, 2021, the
parties are ORDERED to confer and submit a joint letter with their best and current
estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. SO ORDERED. (Signed

10/22/2021
364 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the Court will implement the following procedures for jury selection: A
screening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and 12. The Clerk's
Office will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.
The list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.
Jurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by
their assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed
to defense counsel by the U.S. Attorney's Office. After reviewing the completed
questionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (1)
prospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective
jurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,
but not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the
Government, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires
completed on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.
Lists for questionnaires completed on November 12 will be due to the Court via email
by November 13. If necessary, there will be an in−person conference on November 15
at 9:30 a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November 16−19. The
Court will conduct one−on−one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence
of the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides
indicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain
circumstances. See Transcript at 1011. As the Court indicated, it will consider
proposed narrowly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a
case−by−case basis. See id. at 12. The Court will decide in due course whether the
exercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November 19 or November 29. The
Court implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this
case has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID−19 protocols.
These procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties
and prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,
impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of
criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the
Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is
denied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to
ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 81, 95, 99, 101,
232, 241, 284, 301, 315, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed
and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed
to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre−trial
media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's
consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors
related to this case and upcoming trial. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

376 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is receipt of the parties' letters regarding
the jury questionnaire and voir dire. See Dkt. Nos. 372, 373, 375. The Court will
provide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on
November 16 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror
information sheet in the Courts draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet
required by the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be
removed and collected by the Jury Department from the packet before the parties
review of the questionnaires. The Court is still considering the logistics of when
peremptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will
be exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the swearing in of the jury, preliminary
instructions, and opening statements would commence immediately following the
simultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory challenges. (Signed by

402 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's letter
regarding delivery of Defendant's legal mail at MDC. Dkt. No. 381. The Government
is hereby ORDERED to respond by Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. SO

400 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion
under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, and the Defendant's motion in
limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386. The issues raised in the two
motions overlap significantly. The Court is required under Federal Rule of Evidence
412 to conduct an in camera hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412 ("Before admitting evidence
under this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and
parties a right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion,
related materials, and the record of the hearing must remain under seal.). In addition,
the Court has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the
Defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Because of the overlap in the
substance of the motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back.
The Court previously set a tentative date for the Rule 412 Motion hearing as
November 5, 2021. Dkt. No. 354. The Court is prepared to proceed with both hearings
on that date. Alternatively, the proceedings could be held on either the afternoon of
November 9 or the afternoon of November 10. The Government shall confer with its
proposed expert regarding availability for the Daubert hearing as well as with alleged
victims who wish to attend and be heard at the Rule 412 Motion hearing. After doing
so, the parties shall confer with each other as to availability. On or before November 2,
2021, the parties shall jointly file a letter with the Court indicating whether the parties
request that the hearings be held on November 5, 9, or 10. SO ORDERED. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 10/31/2021)(bw) (Entered: 11/01/2021)

401 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed
redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support,
and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the parties'
proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three−part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In particular, for the reasons stated at today's conference, the Court denies the
Government's request to redact section ten of the Government's motion in limine. See
Dkt. No. 380. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general
description of evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to
protect the privacy interests of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties
must propose more tailored redactions consistent with the Court's discussion at today's
conference. The parties are ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email
by November 4, 2021. In order to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the
Court requires the parties to submit the proposed redactions as a single document and
with the proposed redactions highlighted. The Defendant's proposed redactions should
be highlighted in one color, and the Government's a different color. The Court will rule
on the proposed redactions expeditiously. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

issues that overlap with these two motions as discussed at the November 1, 2021
conference. The proceeding will take place in Courtroom 110 of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, Thurgood Marshall U.S.
Courthouse at 40 Foley Square, New York, New York. The Court will provide
information on public access (for the portion of the Daubert hearing that does not
overlap with the Rule 412 issues) as soon as it is available. Otherwise, the Court will
order the following briefing schedule if the Government seeks to exclude any of the
Defendant's anticipated witness testimony as disclosed in her November 1, 2021
notice. See Dkt. No. 406: Government brief to be filed on ECF: November 8, 2021;
Defense response brief to be filed on ECF: November 11, 2021. The parties are further
ORDERED to docket Exhibit A to Dkt. No. 406 with any proposed redactions on or

redactions, the parties must also submit via email a highlighted copy. SO ORDERED.

412 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
dated November 2, 2021. Dkt. No. 403. The Government is hereby ORDERED to
confer further with MDC legal counsel and file a letter regarding Defendant's
transportation to the courthouse for proceedings in this matter on or before November
8, 2021. The Court hereby authorizes the letter to be filed under seal because such
information may implicate security concerns. The Court will also confer with the
United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York and with the District
Executive regarding transportation of the Defendant for upcoming in court
proceedings and trial. With respect to legal mail, the Court requires MDC Legal
Counsel to consider what additional steps can be taken (including what steps by
counsel for the Government or the Defendant) to ensure that within the weeks leading
up to trial, Ms. Maxwell promptly receives her legal mail. The Government shall
docket a letter with MDC Legal Counsel's proposal on or before November 8, 2021.
The Court will also transmit this Order to Chief Judge Brodie, who is overseeing the
litigation and mediation in Case No. 19−cv−660 (E.D.N.Y.) regarding access to
counsel for pre−trial detainees being held at the MDC so that the issue can be
discussed as to all MDC pre−trial detainees who require prompt access to legal mail in
the weeks leading up to their trials. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

413 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motions
for reconsideration. See Dkt. Nos. 407, 408. The Government is hereby ORDERED to
respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 408, on or before
November 8, 2021. As to the motion for reconsideration regarding the disclosure of
juror names, the Court reminds counsel of the following. First, as the Court previously
indicated, the lawyers will be provided the names of jurors on November 16, prior to
the commencement of the voir dire process. Second, the Court has now resolved the
logistical issues regarding the ability to conduct peremptory challenges on November
and the Court can now confirm that peremptory strikes will not be exercised until
November 29. Finally, as previously indicated, although only 40 qualified jurors are
needed for the exercise of peremptory strikes, the Court will seek to qualify
approximately 50 to 60 prospective jurors to return on November 29 for the exercise of
peremptory strikes. If counsel for either side learns of any additional information that
would be a basis for a strike for cause prior to November 29, they shall immediately
raise the issue with the Court. Bearing in mind this information, the Government is
ORDERED to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 407, on or
before November 4, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

417 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's
supplemental letter regarding its opposition to the defense motion to exclude evidence
of Minor Victim−3. See Dkt. No. 387. The letter is submitted temporarily under seal to
allow defense counsel the opportunity to propose any additional redactions beyond
what the Government proposes. At the November 1, 2021 conference, the Court asked
the Government to provide its position as to whether Alleged "Victim−3" could be
considered a "victim" of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose,
including for purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). See Transcript at
71−72. The Government's supplemental letter does not address this issue. While
acknowledging that the Court's request may have been unclear, the Government is now
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page55 of 91

ORDERED to file a supplemental letter responsive to the Court's question on or before
12:00 p.m. on November 7, 2021. For the sake of clarity, the Government is directed
to state its position as to whether this anticipated witness could be deemed a victim of
any of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for
purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). SO ORDERED. (Signed by

re: Delivery of Legal Mail (Dkt. 412). ENDORSEMENT: SO ORDERED. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/9/2021) (lnl) (Entered: 11/09/2021)
11/09/2021
426 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion
for reconsideration regarding release on bond, Dkt. No. 408, and the parties' letters
regarding the delivery of the Defendant's legal mail and transport to the courthouse for
pretrial conferences and trial in this case, Dkt. Nos. 381, 403, 422. For the reasons
stated in this Court's prior bail determinations, Dkt. Nos. 93, 106, 169, and the
Government's letter in opposition, Dkt. No. 423, the renewed request for bail is denied.
Moreover, based on the representations from MDC legal counsel regarding the
delivery of the Defendant's legal mail, Dkt. No. 422, the Court concludes that the
Defendant has adequate access to legal counsel and legal mail in order to prepare for
trial. MDC legal counsel and the Government are ordered to take the steps outlined in
the Dkt. No. 422 between now and the completion of trial. As to the Defendant's
transport, the Court concludes that she will be transported to and from the courthouse
for pretrial conferences and trial in a way that is humane, proper, and consistent with
security protocols. This conclusion is based on representations from MDC legal
counsel in the letter submitted under seal because it discusses BOP security protocols,
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page56 of 91

see Dkt. No. 412, as well as the Court's communication with the United States Marshal
for the Southern District of New York. The Government, BOP, and USMS shall
continue to take all available measures consistent with security protocols to ensure the
Defendant has sufficient rest, nutrition, and comfort in order to be able to prepare for
and participate in trial. This resolves Dkt. No. 408. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 11/9/2021) (lnl) (Entered: 11/09/2021)
11/09/2021
427 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Attached is the Court's revised draft preliminary
remarks to be recorded and played before each voir dire session. The Court is in
receipt of the Government's letter approving of the remarks, Dkt. No. 420, and the
Defendant's proposed additions, Dkt. No. 419. The revised remarks adopt all but one
of the Defendant's proposals because the Court's subsequent revisions eliminated that
portion of the script. In particular, the Court has made three additional changes in
order to accurately explain the logistics of voir dire. Each of these changes is reflected
in redline. The parties are ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 11,
2021 at 12:00 p.m. whether or not they have any objections or suggestions the Court's
revised preliminary remarks to be played before each voir dire session. Attached is
also the Court's revised draft voir dire in redline. The Court's revisions simplify the
phrasing of questions 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 25, and 37 in an effort to maximize the time
dedicated to questioning each prospective juror. The revision to question 11 reflects
the Court's oral ruling on November 1, 2021 regarding the use of pseudonyms for
certain witnesses. The revisions to questions 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 33 are
non−substantive changes to question numbers in order to accurately reference the
corresponding question numbers on the jury questionnaire or are grammatical changes.
Attached is also the Court's draft instruction sheet for those jurors who are not struck
for cause and will return for the exercise of peremptory strikes, as discussed at the
November 1 conference. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate by letter
on or before November 12, 2021 whether or not they have any objections or
suggestions to the revised voir dire and draft instruction sheet. Finally, the parties are
ORDERED to jointly submit the list of individuals and locations who may be
mentioned at trial for questions 11 and 12 of the voir dire on or before November 14,
2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/9/2021) (lnl)

431 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: As noted in its previous Order, the Court will hold
an in−person proceeding on November 10, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. Dkt. No. 409. The
proceeding will take place in Courtroom 110 of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse at 40 Foley
Square, New York, New York. The purpose of the proceeding is to address the
Defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, the
Defendant's motion in limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386, and
the other outstanding issues that overlap with these two motions as discussed at the
November 1, 2021 conference. As is expressly required by Federal Rule of Evidence
412, the Court must conduct a hearing on this motion in camera and seal the record of
the hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(2). Accordingly, this portion of the hearing will be
sealed and in camera. The Government confirmed that the attorneys for the alleged
victims implicated by the Defendants motion have been notified of their right to attend
the hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. Dkt. No. 430. For the public
portions of the proceeding, the Court will ensure access for alleged victims and any
members of the Defendant's family, in accordance with its prior Order. Dkt. No. 344.
Space will be available in the courtroom proper for members of the media. In order to
comply with the District's COVID−19 protocols, the public and additional members of
the media will be able to access the proceeding in overflow Courtrooms 506 and 905
of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse. These overflow rooms will have live video
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page57 of 91

and audio feeds of the proceeding. The use of any electronic devices during the
proceeding in the overflow rooms is strictly prohibited. The Court anticipates seating
capacity in the overflow rooms for 50 members of the public. If capacity is reached, no
additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID−19, anyone
who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of
the proceeding prior to entering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Only persons who meet the
entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below
100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All visitors must wear a mask
that covers the person's nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and masks with valves
are not permitted. If a person does not have an approved mask, a screener will provide
one. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been
adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions.

458 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
motion seeking clarification on two items from the November 1, 2021 pretrial
conference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification
about the line between permissible and impermissible cross−examination for witnesses
testifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to
permissible cross−examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the
Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross−examination. See United
States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). The line of questioning the
Government identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus
the Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on
cross−examination. As the Court noted at the November 1 conference, the Defendant
may not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment
may be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript at
11−12. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed
order regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November 18,
2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/12/2021) (ap) (Entered: 11/15/2021)

477 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On October 29, 2021, Defendant filed a motion in
limine to exclude evidence related to Accuser−3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court twice
heard argument related to this motion, including extensive argument at the November
10, 2021 in camera hearing that was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412.
See generally Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021 Transcript. The Court has also
considered supplemental briefing from the parties. That briefing has been filed
temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose redactions in
accordance with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In a Memorandum Opinion & Order filed under temporary seal, the Court GRANTS in

690 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Before the Court is
the Defendant's fourth motion in limine to "exclude evidence related to Accuser−3," to
whom the Court refers as Witness−3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct
evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of
Evidence 404(b) and 403. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument
related to this motion, including argument at the November 10, 2021 in camera hearing
that was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See generally Nov. 1, 2021
Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021 Transcript. At the November 1, 2021 hearing, the Court
provided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then
before it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The
Court is now in receipt of the parties' additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to
resolve the motion.(See Footnote 1 on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The
Government now proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness−3 will describe
how she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.
In particular, Witness−3 is anticipated to testify how Defendant introduced her to Mr.
Epstein, how massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role
in facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information now before the Court,
including a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated
testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2−3 (Nov. 5, 2021); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42−43,
the Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct
evidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order
***]... The parties may submit any requested edits to the proposed limiting instructions

that are consistent with the Court's ruling or indicate that they have none on or before

In an Opinion and Order temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES in part and
GRANTS in part the Governments motion to preclude Dr. Dietz's testimony and
DENIES in part and GRANTS in part the Governments motion to preclude Dr.
Loftus's testimony. It doesso after considering the admissibility of the anticipated
testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms.,
Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &
Order to the parties. By November 23, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to inform the
Court whether either seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Court's Opinion &
Order, justifying any such request by reference to the three−part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In addition, by that date, the parties are FURTHER ORDERED to file any proposed
redactions to the Defenses response brief and/or supporting exhibits on the public
docket, again justifying any such request by reference to the Lugosch test (Signed by

691 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
November 1, 2021, noticed eight expert witnesses. Def. Br., Ex. 1 ("Notice"). Two of
those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions
that rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The
Government on November 8, 2021, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony
of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that
motion. On November 15, 2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude
the testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November
19, 2021. The Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written
opinion. In this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett
Gershman based on the parties' current proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion
& Order ***]... III. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's motion
to preclude Gershman's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre−trial
ruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's
analysis. In that event, the Defense must re−raise its request to admit Gershman as an
expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

535 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government
seeks to admit what has been identified as Government Exhibit 52 ("GX 52"), and
submit to the jury a redacted version of GX 52. The Defense objects to the admission
of GX 52 on authentication and hearsay grounds. The admissibility of the exhibit has
been the subject of pretrial motion in limine briefing and extensive supplemental
briefing. See Dkt. Nos. 390, 397, 398, 457, 476, 490. This includes supplemental
briefing received on December 8, 2021, after the authenticating witness, Mr. Juan
Alessi, underwent direct examination by the Government and voir dire by the Defense.
The Court reserved ruling on the exhibit, pending what was anticipated to be
additional testimony. Trial Tr. at 876. The Court now overrules the Defenses
objections. The parties are ORDERED to confer and propose a limiting instruction
consistent with this ruling on or before today, December 9, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. The
parties are FURTHER ORDERED to confer and prepare a stipulation that Government
Exhibits 52A, 52D, 52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are true and correct photocopies of five
pages from GX 52. See Trial Tr. at 858. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

12/15/2021
548 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
December 12, 2021, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a
pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a letter opposing this
request on December 14, 2021. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of
anonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permitted
three alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under
pseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's
motion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court
emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of
course raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning
into witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or
otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 133 (1968)
(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to
protect a witness "from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper
cross−examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him"). SO ORDERED.

12/15/2021
694 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's motion
to preclude certain testimony of defense witnesses, dated December 15, 2021. The
Defense is ORDERED to submit a response as follows: − A response to the motion
with respect to Dr. Loftus by today, December 15, 2021, at 7:45 p.m. − A response to
the motion with respect to Alexander Hamilton by tomorrow, December 16, 2021, at
7:00 a.m. − A response to the motion with respect to the other anticipated witnesses by
tomorrow, December 16, 2021, at 5:00 p.m. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison

551 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the parties' joint letter

Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page73 of 91

many of these statements raise one of two questions: (1) must counsel show the
witness the prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b), and (2) is a statement
admissible when the witness affirms that the 3500 material contains the inconsistent
statement and also expresses disagreement with the substance." The parties are hereby
ORDERED to submit a letter citing authority (beyond the rule itself) for their
respective positions. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate each disputed
prior inconsistent statement that was read into the record. Letters must be submitted as
soon as possible but no later than today, December 16, 2021, at 10:15 p.m. The parties
are FURTHER ORDERED to docket their respective letters by tomorrow, December

571 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters. Dkt.
Nos. 568, 569, 570. The Court hereby sets the following briefing schedule for the
Defense to move for a new trial in light of the issues raised in the parties' letters:
Defense motion: January 19, 2022; Government response: February 2, 2022; Defense
reply: February 9, 2022. The parties' briefing should address whether an inquiry of
some kind is permitted and/or required, and, if so, the nature of such an inquiry.
Although the Court reserves decision on whether an inquiry of any kind is warranted,
the Court grants the Government's request, Dkt. No. 568, to offer court−appointed
counsel to the juror in issue. Subject to the juror's right to decline court−appointed
counsel, the Court will appoint the on−duty CJA counsel to represent the juror. If
counsel for the juror wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an
inquiry, briefing by the juror's counsel may be filed by January 26, 2022. The Court
will not adjourn post−trial briefing on other issues as requested by the Defense, Dkt.
No. 569, but sets the following schedule for any other post−verdict motion by the
Defense: Defense motion: February 4, 2022; Government opposition: February 18,
2022; Defense reply: March 4, 2022. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Andrew) (Entered: 01/10/2022)
01/12/2022
575 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The parties are ORDERED to submit via email any
proposed redactions on or before January 13, 2022, justifying any such request by
reference to the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). If any redactions are
proposed, the Court will determine whether any are appropriate and then docket the
motion. The parties shall respond to Juror 50s motion on or before January 20, 2022.
Upon further reflection, unless and until Juror No. 50 is permitted to intervene, he may
have no standing to be heard on the question of whether an inquiry should be
conducted. Accordingly, the Court withdraws the aspect of its prior order setting
January 26, 2022, as the date by which counsel for Juror 50 should file a submission
on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry. Dkt. No. 571. The Court will hear
from the parties first regarding Juror 50's pending motion. Depending on the resolution
of that motion, the Court will provide further guidance to counsel for Juror 50
regarding any permitted submission. If a further submission is permitted, the Court
will provide ECF docketing access to counsel for Juror 50 at that time (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/12/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/12/2022)
01/14/2022
576 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court required the parties to indicate whether
Juror 50's motion to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors completed
questionnaire and voir dire should be redacted. Dkt. No. 575. In response, the parties
have submitted letters to the Court indicating their differing views on whether Juror
50s motion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Courtconcludes that
it must first address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permittedand/or
required before considering Juror 50s requests. Accordingly, the Court will not
consider or act on Juror 50's request to intervene and to be provided a copy of the
jurors completed questionnaire and voir dire until the Court receives the parties
briefing on the appropriateness of an inquiry and the nature of any such inquiry. The
Court will maintain Juror 50's motion temporarily under seal until the Court considers
the parties arguments and determines the appropriate next steps. Consistent with this
and to (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/14/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/14/2022)

577 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' joint letter
regarding a schedule for sentencing and resolution of the severed perjury counts. Dkt.
No. 574. The Court hereby schedules the sentencing in this matter for June 28, 2022, at
11:00 a.m. The Court will delay ordering the preparation of a presentence investigation
report until April 2022. The Court previously set the schedule for briefing on the new
trial motion as well as all other post−verdict motions. Dkt. No. 571. That schedule
remains in place. The Court adopts the parties proposal that the scheduling of any
proceedings related to the severed perjury counts be deferred until the post−verdict
motions are resolved. By January 18, 2022, the Government shall indicate in a joint
letter whether it is seeking an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act for the
perjury counts and the basis for any requested exclusion. In the joint letter, the defense
shall indicate whether it consents to the proposed exclusion of time (Sentencing set for
6/28/2022 at 11:00 AM before Judge Alison J. Nathan.) (Signed by Judge Alison J.

excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from todays
date through April 1, 2022. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting
this exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and
the defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the time is necessary for the
parties to research and brief post−trial motions. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

584 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As a post−trial housekeeping matter, Court staff
directed the parties via email to complete the process of providing copies of Court
Exhibits with narrowly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity of
jurors and of witnesses the Court permitted to testify under pseudonyms) for the Court
to docket. The Government subsequently submitted one court exhibit with the name
unredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the
Defense indicated in a temporarily sealed letter why the name was unredacted. The
Government is accordingly ORDERED to docket a letter on ECF on or before January
28, 2022, indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this
witness. Once the Government confirms in that letter that it no longer seeks redaction
of the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed letter on the docket
without redaction of the name. The Court will then docket all Court Exhibits. (Signed
by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/26/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/26/2022)

01/26/2022
585 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a
new trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.
No. 580. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the
motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this matter and will
ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the
same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering
these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process
going forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the
Defendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense
requests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is
DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to
undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The
Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the public docket on or before
February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three−part test
in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The
Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification letter on or
before February 4, 2022. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial
motion is due February 2, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. Per the established practice in this case,
the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allow the Defense the
opportunity to propose narrowly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party
proposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a letter
justifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense
letter must be filed on or before February 8, 2022, and the Government letter must be
filed by February 11, 2022. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in
support, which is due February 9, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. If redactions or sealing are
proposed, the Defense letter justifying such requests would be due February 15, 2022,
and the Government letter would be due February 18, 2022. The parties are
FURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal
the filled−out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583. Letters by
both parties must be submitted via ECF on or before February 11, 2022. SO

593 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: As a post−trial house−keeping matter, attached to
this Order are the Court Exhibits. The parties have proposed redactions to several
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page79 of 91

exhibits and the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed
redactions are consistent with the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly
tailored. The redactions serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of
victim−witnesses subject to the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit
4, rather than seal the entire document, the Court has redacted the information that
would potentially identify the victim−witness who testified pursuant to the Court's
anonymity order. Unredacted copies of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal.

596 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters
addressing the Defendant's request to temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and
accompanying exhibits, and the Governments response in opposition and
accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media organizations
have also filed letters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50's
motion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The
Defendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 50's motion. For the reasons
outlined more fully below, the Court rules as follows. First, the Defendant's motion to
temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a new trial is
DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrowly tailored to serve
competing interests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/11/22)(jw) (Entered:

607 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's proposed
redactions revised in response to this Court's order. See Dkt. Nos. 605, 606. The Court
has reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with
its prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 605. The narrowly tailored redactions further the
important interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror
anonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February 11 Order, these
interests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing
and specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly
reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming
hearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. 14 Cr. 6181
(EAW), Dkt. No. 312 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2017); id. Dkt. No. 329 at
38−39; Press−Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501,
511−12 (1984)). Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,
accompanying exhibits, and their January 13 letters, by February 25, 2022. The Court
will docket Juror 50's motion. As noted in its prior Order, following the Court's
resolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly
unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity
and privacy. See United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 146−47 (2d Cir. 1995); see

610 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &
Order, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the
important interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a
post−verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that
the demanding standard for holding a post−verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to
whether Juror 50 failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to
whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct,
unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do
not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses
during jury selection. Juror 50's post−trial statements are "clear, strong, substantial and
incontrovertible evidence that a specific, non−speculative impropriety"namely, a false
statement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123,
130 (2d Cir. 2018). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a
history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure
to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that
material information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the
demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of
any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to
the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing
and pre−hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at
Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page81 of 91

which the Court will question Juror 50 under oath. The Court further ORDERS that
Juror 50's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.
The Court will email counsel for Juror 50 a copy of his questionnaire and a copy of
this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the
questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the
Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance with
the Opinion & Order on or before March 1, 2022. The hearing will take place on
March 8, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 50 to appear in Courtroom
906 of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York,
New York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's
questions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public
access as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &
Order to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2022, the parties are ORDERED to
inform the Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order,
conforming any requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any
such request by reference to the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). (Status

the parties submitted revised redactions to their briefing on the Defendants motion for

anonymity and privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court concludes that the remaining
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to further the important interest of protecting
juror anonymity and privacy. Press−Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty.,

653 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 50
testified credibly and truthfully at the post−trial hearing. His failure to disclose his
prior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not
deliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the
Defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new
trial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial
pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the
presentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby
excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from today's
date through April 22, 2022. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting
this exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and
the Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post−trial motions
affect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January 10, 2022
letter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 650. The
Court will rule on the Defendant's remaining post−verdict motions in due course.
Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. This resolves docket numbers 613,
614, 642, 650, and 651. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/1/2022) (See ORDER

655 LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene

Advance PSR Deadline . Document filed by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell. (Rohrbach,

04/26/2022
656 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
regarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.
No. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that
advancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their
sentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing
submission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,
the Court ORDERS the following schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2022 − First PSR
disclosure; May 31, 2022 − Defendant objections due; June 6, 2022 − Government
response due; June 9, 2022 − Second PSR disclosure; June 15, 2022 − Defendant
sentencing submission due; June 22, 2022 − Government sentencing submission due;
June 28, 2022 − Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

04/29/2022
657 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order
***]... V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's
Rule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness
testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the
Defendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury
instructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core
of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any
alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its
prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the
Defendant's motion based on pre−indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the
Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is
multiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is
multiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the
Defendant's participation in the same decade−long unlawful agreement with the
Defendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse
underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts
Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,
2022. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in

682 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA)
"guarantees to the victims of federal crimes an array of substantive and participatory
rights, including the rights to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the
district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding, to confer
with the attorney for the Government in the case, and to receive full and timely
restitution as provided in law." United States v. Murillo−Bejerano (In re Rendon
Galvis), 564 F.3d 170, 174 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (cleaned up). "In any court
proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the
crime victim is afforded th[ose] rights." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). In accordance with
the procedure required by this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 671, the Government has
provided statements from seven individuals asserting they are crime victims under the
CVRA. As explained below, the Court will permit all seven individuals to provide
statements and the Defendant's request for redactions is denied....[*** See this Order
***]... In sum, all seven written statements received by the Court are deemed part of
the record. The Court will consider them only for what they permissibly may be
considered. The Government shall promptly docket the written statements without
redactions. Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre may present an in−person
statement at sentencing if they wish to do so. The Government shall provide copies of
this Order to counsel for the seven individuals who submitted statements by no later
than today, June 24, 2022. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

686 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court has now received and docketed the full
set of submissions related to victim impact statements that were filed in accordance
with this Court's prior order. Dkt. No. 668. The Court received statements from Annie
Farmer, Kate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliette
Bryant, and Elizabeth Stein. As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its
discretion to permit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The
Court also denied the Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are
now part of the record. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675−1. Also as previously indicated in its order,
the Court will permit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral
statement at sentencing if they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having now
reviewed the full set of requests, and having heard from the Government that it does
not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court deems it feasible to exercise its discretion to permit
the remaining individuals who seek to themselves make an oral statement at
sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm, Sarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In
order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the anticipated length of the sentencing
proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding delay of sentencing, each individual
speaking orally may read a shortened version of their previously submitted written
statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to be responsible for ensuring
that anticipated statements conform to this requirement. The Government shall
promptly provide copies of this order to counsel for the eight individuals who
submitted statements. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

DEFENDANT:
CASE NUMBER:
STANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION
As part of your supervised release, you must comply with the following standard conditions of supervision.  These conditions are imposed
because they establish the basic expectations for your behavior while on supervision and identify the minimum tools needed by probation
officers to keep informed, report to the court about, and bring about improvements in your conduct and condition. 

You must report to the probation office in the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside within 72 hours of your
release from imprisonment, unless the probation officer instructs you to report to a different probation office or within a different time
frame.

After initially reporting to the probation office, you will receive instructions from the court or the probation officer about how and
when you must report to the probation officer, and you must report to the probation officer as instructed.

You must not knowingly leave the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside without first getting permission from the
court or the probation officer.

You must answer truthfully the questions asked by your probation officer.

You must live at a place approved by the probation officer. If you plan to change where you live or anything about your living
arrangements (such as the people you live with), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying
the probation officer in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72
hours of becoming aware of a change or expected change.

You must allow the probation officer to visit you at any time at your home or elsewhere, and you must permit the probation officer to
take any items prohibited by the conditions of your supervision that he or she observes in plain view.

You must work full time (at least 30 hours per week) at a lawful type of employment, unless the probation officer excuses you from
doing so.  If you do not have full-time employment you must try to find full-time employment, unless the probation officer excuses
you from doing so. If you plan to change where you work or anything about your work (such as your position or your job
responsibilities), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying the probation officer at least 10
days in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours ofbecoming 
aware of a change or expected change.

You must not communicate or interact with someone you know is engaged in criminal activity.  If you know someone has been
convicted of a felony, you must not knowingly communicate or interact with that person without first getting the permission of the
probation officer.

If you are arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours.

You must not own, possess, or have access to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device, or dangerous weapon (i.e., anything that was
designed, or was modified for, the specific purpose of causing bodily injury or death to another person such as nunchakus or tasers).

You must not act or make any agreement with a law enforcement agency to act as a confidential human source or informant without
first getting the permission of the court.

S2 20 CR 330 (AJN)
You shall submit your person, and any property, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communication,
data storage devices, cloud storage or media, and effects to a search by any United States Probation Officer, and if
needed, with the assistance of any law enforcement. The search is to be conducted when there is reasonable suspicion
concerning violation of a condition of supervision or unlawful conduct by the person being supervised. Failure to submit to
a search may be grounds for revocation of release. You shall warn any other occupants that the premises may be subject
to searches pursuant to this condition. Any search shall be conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.
You shall undergo a sex-offense-specific evaluation and participate in an outpatient sex offender treatment and/or

approved by the sex-offender specific treatment provider. You must waive your right of confidentiality in any records for
mental health assessment and treatment imposed as a consequence of this judgment to allow the U.S. Probation Office to

rendered based on your ability to pay and the availability of third-party payments. The Court authorizes the release of
available psychological and psychiatric evaluations and reports, including the presentence investigation report, to the sex

probation officer.
You must provide the probation officer with access to any requested financial information.
You must not incur new credit charges or open additional lines of credit without the approval of the probation officer unless
you are in compliance with the installment payment schedule.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page8 of 92

and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page9 of 92

then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Jeffrey S. Pagliuca

Maxwell. (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)
07/23/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be
followed that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:
(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be

Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 12/07/2020)
12/08/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all
necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant continues to receive adequate access to
her legal materials and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. (Signed by

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in

against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency'
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are

thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 16, 2020, the Government filed its
opposition to Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed application for bail. In
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89, the
Government filed its materials under seal and proposed narrowly tailored redactions on
those materials. The Defendant did not file any opposition to the Government's

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

03/18/2021
168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)
03/22/2021
169 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's third motion for
release on bail, Dkt. No. 160, is DENIED. The parties are ORDERED to meet and
confer and propose and justify any redactions to the Defendant's reply brief by March
24, 2021. If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed

171 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 160
THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page25 of 92

subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

responding to the Court's March 29, 2021 Order. The parties agree that the redactions
to pages 118 and 119 are no longer necessary. The Defendant continues to press for
the redactions on pages 129134. However, for the reasons stated in the Court's March
29, 2021 Order, the information is already part of the public record in this case and
accordingly the proposed redactions are unnecessary and overbroad. Dkt. No. 189; see
also United States v. Nejad, No. 18−CR−224 (AJN), 2021 WL 681427, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2021). For the reasons stated in the Court's March 18, 2021 and
March 29, 2021 Orders, the Court approves the limited redactions to Exhibit 11 to the
Government's brief, except for the language quoted in the Indictment, which is already
part of the public record. The Government is therefore ORDERED to docket its
omnibus memorandum of law, along with the corresponding exhibits, by 3:00 p.m.
today, consistent with the Court's orders regarding redactions. The parties are further
ORDERED to docket their April 1, 2021 joint letter; if either side believes that
portions of that letter should be redacted, they shall propose redactions by April 19,
2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/16/2021) (ap) (Entered: 04/16/2021)

205 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 15, 2021, the Defendant filed under seal
her reply briefs to the Government memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve
pre−trial motions. She filed the briefs, along with the corresponding exhibits,
temporarily under seal in order to permit the Government and the Court to review
certain proposed redactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11,
and 12 did not contain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10
contain limited proposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and 10 also contain exhibits
that the Defendant proposes be filed under seal. As set forth in the Defendant's cover
letter, the premise of the proposed redactions is that the materials were produced in
discovery and subject to the protective order that has been entered in this case. The
mere existence of a confidentiality agreement or a protective order covering judicial
documents is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi Nissay
Dowa Ins. Co. v. Prosight Specialty Mgmt. Co., Inc., 12−cv−3274 (JPO), 2012 WL
3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012). And the Court did not receive specific
requests or justifications to redact or seal any of the materials. The Defendant is
ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 on ECF today, as she did
not propose any redactions to these and the Government has not voiced any opposition
to these being filed without redactions. If either side is seeking these or any other
redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they must file a letter indicating the redactions
they request and providing specific justifications for the sealing requests or redactions,
in line with the principles set forth in Lugosch. By April 20, 2021, the parties shall
confer and submit a letter informing the Court whether any redactions are being
sought. If no redactions are being sought, the Defendant is ORDERED to docket the

206 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 143
MOTION to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Superseding Indictment as
Time−Barred. . (Everdell, Christian) (Entered: 04/16/2021)
04/16/2021
207 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2020, a grand jury returned a
six−count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 1994 to 1997. The
Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which
contained only small, ministerial corrections. The S1 superseding indictment included
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in
violation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It
also included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil
deposition. Trial is set to begin on July 12, 2021. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial
motions seeking to dismiss portions of the S1 superseding indictment, suppress
evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand
jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and
another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently
pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the
Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with
the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added
sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's
motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further
expedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its
reasoning on the pages that follow:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...
Conclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as
barred by Epstein's non−prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann
Act counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the
indictment for pre−indictment delay (Dkt. No. 137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts
for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable
(Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to dismiss count one or count three
as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. 147).
The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial
(Dkt. No. 119). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week
whether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non−prosecution
agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 16 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or
will disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final
schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,
and Jenks Act materials, including co−conspirator statements; non−testifying witness
statements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the
indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires
the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing
in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submitted by
April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective
proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why
her motion to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.
No. 125) should not be denied as moot. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

216 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the
Defendant's motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part and
granted the Defendant' s motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt.
No. 207. The Court will try the non−perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its
Opinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See
Dkt. Nos. 133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government
obtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her
rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self−incrimination, and to
due process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to
determine whether the Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an
order modifying the protective order. The Court requires information from the
Government for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the
Court by letter docketed on ECF no later than April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use
any of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the
non−perjury counts in this case. If the Government does not intend to use any of the
documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the non−perjury
counts, the Court will defer consideration of those motions until it has scheduled the
trial of the perjury counts. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene
Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 20, 2021 re:
Redactions to Defense Reply Briefs and Exhibits. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants
the Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided
by the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes
that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law
presumptions of access attach. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, however, the Court finds that the specific arguments the
Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy
interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions.
See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). The Government's
letter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By April 23, 2021, the parties shall
either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6, which was originally filed
under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no redactions and file it on

seal with proposed redactions. The proposed redactions are GRANTED. The Court's
conclusion is guided by the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test,

their professional obligations under the rules of professional conduct. The Defendant is

pertain to an incident that took place on April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,
259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her
lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an
in−person attorney−client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers
categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff
based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no
views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of
either sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure
that the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in
confidential attorney−client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that
obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the
defenses first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause why
the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted
in part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to
certain questions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to
ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer−client communications. Dkt. No.
255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over
copies of video tapes of the in−person attorney−client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video
tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248,
Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of
those materials as a matter of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense
counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is
denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the
opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all
relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates
in BOP custody. The isolated incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page37 of 92

serious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way
undermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to
prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize the importance of this
going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. In furtherance of this, counsel for
the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal counsel for MDC to ensure that
Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney−client communications
as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel shall
promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek
to resolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails,
the parties may write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and
justifying any specific application being made. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
5/3/2021) (ap) (Entered: 05/03/2021)

266 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice
justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021
to be reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient
time to prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2
indictment while also ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No
additional delay is necessary or in the interests of justice. The parties are hereby
ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 2021, they shall jointly propose a trial
start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office (as is required by COVID
protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest possible date this fall and to
seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an early fall trial start date.
The parties shall also discuss and propose any adjustments necessary to the pre−trial
schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government may move in the letter for any
requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
Nathan on 5/3/2021) (See ORDER set forth) (ap) (Entered: 05/03/2021)

268 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 30, 2021, defense counsel requested that
the Court issue an order directing the MDC to accept two hard drives from defense
counsel that contain the non−Highly Confidential discovery in this case for Ms.
Maxwell's use. Dkt. No. 260. On May 4, 2021, the Court received the attached email
from MDC legal counsel indicating that MDC does not oppose the defense's request
and that MDC staff will coordinate with defense counsel so that Ms. Maxwell can
receive the hard drives. In light of this, defense counsel's April 30, 2021 request
appears moot. Defense counsel shall raise any further issues regarding their request
within two weeks of this order. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/4/2021) (ap)

Bobbi) (Entered: 05/11/2021)
05/11/2021
277 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has considered the parties' proposals
regarding the commencement of trial. Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the
Government's letter, the Court will request November 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office
as the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office
consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to
the jury. However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury
selection occur during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The
Court grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021. The
Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial
computations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh
the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is
necessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in
light of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in
limine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to
allow adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded
under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021. In
order to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will
adjust the current pre−trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in
advance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be
fully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial
commencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose
adjustments to other pre−trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby
ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 30 minutes by phone regarding the overall
pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint letter by May 14, 2021. The Court will
accept only a joint letter with a joint proposal or with each sides views briefly stated.
The letter must attest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed letters will be struck.

hereby ORDERED to notify the Court by May 14, 2021 whether it requests that any

MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison
Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated May 14, 2021. ENDORSEMENT:
The request for an extension of time until May 21, 2021 to respond to the Court's May
11, 2021 Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
5/14/2021) (lnl) (Entered: 05/14/2021)
05/14/2021
282 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell
wrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with
particular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other
factual showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every 15
minutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance
in Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to
prepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the
Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to
certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff
conduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As
reported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing
Unit are checked with flashlights every 30 minutes. Inmates housed with others in the
general population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The
Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the
ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.
As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's
flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,
including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential
stress for inmates that can arise in high−profile cases. The MDC has determined that
these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government
also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but
that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her
eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override
BOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check
procedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.
Certainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere
with Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.
Defense counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances
but makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the
Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be
reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to
ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines
are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre−trial detainees. The
Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for
the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/14/2021) (lnl)

Document filed by USA. (Rohrbach, Andrew) (Entered: 05/14/2021)
05/17/2021
284 MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 278 Letter Proposed
Redactions to Defendant's Supplemental Pre−Trial Motions... ENDORSEMENT: The
Court grants in part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is
guided by the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court concludes that these are
judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of
access attach. Id. at 11920. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put
forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties
and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v.
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page40 of 92

Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). Similarly, the Court concludes that the
Government has shown that Exhibits E, F, G, H, and I should be filed under seal. With
respect to Exhibit C, however, the Court concludes that narrowly tailored redactions
are sufficient to advance the privacy interests the Government has identified.
Accordingly, the Government is ORDERED to confer with defense counsel and
submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

303 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell's motions to suppress evidence (Dkt. Nos.
133, 139) are DENIED. The Court sets out its reasoning in an opinion concurrently
filed under temporary seal to allow Maxwell and the Government the opportunity to
propose redactions. The parties may file under seal any proposed redactions to the
opinion within three days. The Court further ORDERS that the April 9, 2019
memorandum decision and order on the Government's application to modify the
protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15−cv−7433, as well as the transcripts of
the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that application shall be
unsealed. These documents were previously filed under seal as Exhibits D, E, F, and G
to the memorandum of law in support of Maxwell's first motion to suppress (Dkt. No.
134). Within one week, the parties shall confer and file under seal any proposed
redactions to the memorandum decision, order, and transcripts. Any proposed
redactions shall be narrowly tailored and shall be supported with reference to the
Second Circuit's opinion in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d
Cir. 2006). The parties proposed redactions should not include any information that
has already been made public. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

304 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court grants the Defendant's request that going
forward the Government shall only file updates if there are any material changes to
Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 300 at 1. In the absence of any
other specific or supported application for relief from the Defendant, the Court will
take no further action at this time. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

307 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell moves to suppress evidence
obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation
against her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were
previously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of
her rights against compelled self−incrimination, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the
Government did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence
covered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is
not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus
DENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. 133, 139) (Signed by Judge Alison
J. Nathan on 6/25/21)(jw) (Entered: 07/01/2021)
06/30/2021
305 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2021 (Dkt.

suppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 30, 2021. Any proposed
redactions to the other documents ordered unsealed in that order must be filed no later
than July 2, 2021. The parties shall file a joint letter by each of these dates informing
the Court if no redactions are sought. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

April 9, 2019 memorandum decision and order on the Governments application to
modify the protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15−cv−7433, as well as the
transcripts of the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that

314 LETTER addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from David Oscar Markus dated 7/9/21
re: The Governments request should be denied because (1) undersigned counsel does
not currently represent Ms. Maxwell, and (2) the Op−Ed did not violate the local rules.
(jw) (Entered: 07/12/2021)
07/30/2021
315 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government has moved for an order requiring
David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op−ed that he
authored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 309. Mr. Markus is
therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1. The Government does
not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op−ed and the Court declines
to consider whether it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack of clarity with respect
to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule
provides illustrative examples of statements that "presumptively involve a substantial
likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise
prejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule." S.D.N.Y.
Local Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated
with the pending case are now clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the
purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.1. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to
Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel[,] agents for the parties and
counsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair
trial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal matters
heading toward trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those
associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they
risk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of
the upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the
impact it could have on this matter, failure to comply could also result in attorney
discipline. Id. Rule 23.1(i). (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/21)(jw)

indictment. This resolves Dkt. No. 292. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

318 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 19, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted a sealed and ex parte motion for an order authorizing four subpoenas
pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. By sealed order
dated March 22, 2021, the Court provided an opportunity for recipients of the
subpoenas to respond to the requests by March 30, 2021, but it received no responses.
In an Opinion and Order temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES Maxwell's
motion without prejudice. It does so after concluding that none of the proposed
subpoenas conform to the factors first set out in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683,
69870 (1974). The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion and Order to
defense counsel. By August 18, 2021, Maxwell is ORDERED to inform the Court
whether she seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Court's opinion and of her
original motion papers, justifying any such request by reference to the three−part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d
110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date Maxwell shall inform the Court whether
she seeks full sealing or redactions of the original motion, again justifying any such
request by reference to the Lugosch test. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

334 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell's motion is, at this time,
DENIED without prejudice. She may renew any Rule 17(c) applications upon a proper
showing that each of the requested materials satisfies the Nixon test, as described
above and in the Court's April 27, 2021 and June 2, 2021 Orders. The Court will file
this Opinion & Order under temporary seal to allow consideration of any sealing or
redaction requests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 8/13/2021) (See ORDER set

logistics for trial in this matter and requires the parties' best and current estimate of
length of trial. The Court plans to have the jury sit 5 days a week from 9am until 5pm.
Given that jury selection will be complete by November 19 and opening statements
will occur on November 29, the Court requests that the parties provide their best
estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. This will allow the Court
to assess the likelihood that trial may continue after the Christmas holiday and
therefore whether the jury may be required to sit some days during the week between
Christmas and New Year's Day. Accordingly, on or before October 12, 2021, the
parties are ORDERED to confer and submit a joint letter with their best and current
estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. SO ORDERED. (Signed

from Counsels of record for the Government dated 10/15/21 re: Government response
to Order of The Court dated 10/15/21 (Dkt No. 348).ENDORSEMENT: Based on the
information in this letter the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order. See
Dkt. 346. However, it is the Court's firm expectation that a defendant in a pre−trial
posture like Ms. Maxwell will in most circumstances receive legal mail within
approximately 1 business day. Going forward, if another delay occurs, the Defendant
may renew the request for a specific order requiring delivery within the time frame.
With this understanding and in light of the unusually early pre−trial disclosure
schedule set by the Court, the Court remains confident that Ms. Maxwell and her

10/22/2021
364 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the Court will implement the following procedures for jury selection: A
screening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and 12. The Clerk's
Office will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.
The list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.
Jurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by
their assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed
to defense counsel by the U.S. Attorney's Office. After reviewing the completed
questionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (1)
prospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective
jurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,
but not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the
Government, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires
completed on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.
Lists for questionnaires completed on November 12 will be due to the Court via email
by November 13. If necessary, there will be an in−person conference on November 15
at 9:30 a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November 16−19. The
Court will conduct one−on−one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence
of the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides
indicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain
circumstances. See Transcript at 1011. As the Court indicated, it will consider
proposed narrowly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a
case−by−case basis. See id. at 12. The Court will decide in due course whether the
exercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November 19 or November 29. The
Court implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this
case has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID−19 protocols.
These procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties
and prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,
impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of
criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the
Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is
denied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to
ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 81, 95, 99, 101,
232, 241, 284, 301, 315, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed
and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed
to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre−trial
media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's
consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors
related to this case and upcoming trial. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

376 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is receipt of the parties' letters regarding
the jury questionnaire and voir dire. See Dkt. Nos. 372, 373, 375. The Court will
provide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on
November 16 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror
information sheet in the Courts draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet
required by the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be
removed and collected by the Jury Department from the packet before the parties
review of the questionnaires. The Court is still considering the logistics of when
peremptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will
be exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the swearing in of the jury, preliminary
instructions, and opening statements would commence immediately following the
simultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory challenges. (Signed by

402 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's letter
regarding delivery of Defendant's legal mail at MDC. Dkt. No. 381. The Government
is hereby ORDERED to respond by Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. SO

400 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion
under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, and the Defendant's motion in
limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386. The issues raised in the two
motions overlap significantly. The Court is required under Federal Rule of Evidence
412 to conduct an in camera hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412 ("Before admitting evidence
under this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and
parties a right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion,
related materials, and the record of the hearing must remain under seal.). In addition,
the Court has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the
Defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Because of the overlap in the
substance of the motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back.
The Court previously set a tentative date for the Rule 412 Motion hearing as
November 5, 2021. Dkt. No. 354. The Court is prepared to proceed with both hearings
on that date. Alternatively, the proceedings could be held on either the afternoon of
November 9 or the afternoon of November 10. The Government shall confer with its
proposed expert regarding availability for the Daubert hearing as well as with alleged
victims who wish to attend and be heard at the Rule 412 Motion hearing. After doing
so, the parties shall confer with each other as to availability. On or before November 2,
2021, the parties shall jointly file a letter with the Court indicating whether the parties
request that the hearings be held on November 5, 9, or 10. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

401 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed
redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support,
and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the parties'
proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three−part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In particular, for the reasons stated at today's conference, the Court denies the
Government's request to redact section ten of the Government's motion in limine. See
Dkt. No. 380. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general
description of evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to
protect the privacy interests of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties
must propose more tailored redactions consistent with the Court's discussion at today's
conference. The parties are ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email
by November 4, 2021. In order to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the
Court requires the parties to submit the proposed redactions as a single document and
with the proposed redactions highlighted. The Defendant's proposed redactions should
be highlighted in one color, and the Government's a different color. The Court will rule
on the proposed redactions expeditiously. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

conference. The proceeding will take place in Courtroom 110 of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, Thurgood Marshall U.S.
Courthouse at 40 Foley Square, New York, New York. The Court will provide
information on public access (for the portion of the Daubert hearing that does not
overlap with the Rule 412 issues) as soon as it is available. Otherwise, the Court will
order the following briefing schedule if the Government seeks to exclude any of the
Defendant's anticipated witness testimony as disclosed in her November 1, 2021
notice. See Dkt. No. 406: Government brief to be filed on ECF: November 8, 2021;
Defense response brief to be filed on ECF: November 11, 2021. The parties are further
ORDERED to docket Exhibit A to Dkt. No. 406 with any proposed redactions on or

412 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
dated November 2, 2021. Dkt. No. 403. The Government is hereby ORDERED to
confer further with MDC legal counsel and file a letter regarding Defendant's
transportation to the courthouse for proceedings in this matter on or before November
8, 2021. The Court hereby authorizes the letter to be filed under seal because such
information may implicate security concerns. The Court will also confer with the
United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York and with the District
Executive regarding transportation of the Defendant for upcoming in court
proceedings and trial. With respect to legal mail, the Court requires MDC Legal
Counsel to consider what additional steps can be taken (including what steps by
counsel for the Government or the Defendant) to ensure that within the weeks leading
up to trial, Ms. Maxwell promptly receives her legal mail. The Government shall
docket a letter with MDC Legal Counsel's proposal on or before November 8, 2021.
The Court will also transmit this Order to Chief Judge Brodie, who is overseeing the
litigation and mediation in Case No. 19−cv−660 (E.D.N.Y.) regarding access to
counsel for pre−trial detainees being held at the MDC so that the issue can be
discussed as to all MDC pre−trial detainees who require prompt access to legal mail in
the weeks leading up to their trials. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

413 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motions
for reconsideration. See Dkt. Nos. 407, 408. The Government is hereby ORDERED to
respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 408, on or before
November 8, 2021. As to the motion for reconsideration regarding the disclosure of
juror names, the Court reminds counsel of the following. First, as the Court previously
indicated, the lawyers will be provided the names of jurors on November 16, prior to
the commencement of the voir dire process. Second, the Court has now resolved the
logistical issues regarding the ability to conduct peremptory challenges on November
and the Court can now confirm that peremptory strikes will not be exercised until
November 29. Finally, as previously indicated, although only 40 qualified jurors are
needed for the exercise of peremptory strikes, the Court will seek to qualify
approximately 50 to 60 prospective jurors to return on November 29 for the exercise of
peremptory strikes. If counsel for either side learns of any additional information that
would be a basis for a strike for cause prior to November 29, they shall immediately
raise the issue with the Court. Bearing in mind this information, the Government is
ORDERED to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 407, on or
before November 4, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

supplemental letter regarding its opposition to the defense motion to exclude evidence
of Minor Victim−3. See Dkt. No. 387. The letter is submitted temporarily under seal to
allow defense counsel the opportunity to propose any additional redactions beyond
what the Government proposes. At the November 1, 2021 conference, the Court asked
the Government to provide its position as to whether Alleged "Victim−3" could be
considered a "victim" of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose,
including for purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). See Transcript at
71−72. The Government's supplemental letter does not address this issue. While
acknowledging that the Court's request may have been unclear, the Government is now

426 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion
for reconsideration regarding release on bond, Dkt. No. 408, and the parties' letters
regarding the delivery of the Defendant's legal mail and transport to the courthouse for
pretrial conferences and trial in this case, Dkt. Nos. 381, 403, 422. For the reasons
stated in this Court's prior bail determinations, Dkt. Nos. 93, 106, 169, and the
Government's letter in opposition, Dkt. No. 423, the renewed request for bail is denied.
Moreover, based on the representations from MDC legal counsel regarding the
delivery of the Defendant's legal mail, Dkt. No. 422, the Court concludes that the
Defendant has adequate access to legal counsel and legal mail in order to prepare for
trial. MDC legal counsel and the Government are ordered to take the steps outlined in
the Dkt. No. 422 between now and the completion of trial. As to the Defendant's
transport, the Court concludes that she will be transported to and from the courthouse
for pretrial conferences and trial in a way that is humane, proper, and consistent with
security protocols. This conclusion is based on representations from MDC legal
counsel in the letter submitted under seal because it discusses BOP security protocols,
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page57 of 92

see Dkt. No. 412, as well as the Court's communication with the United States Marshal
for the Southern District of New York. The Government, BOP, and USMS shall
continue to take all available measures consistent with security protocols to ensure the
Defendant has sufficient rest, nutrition, and comfort in order to be able to prepare for
and participate in trial. This resolves Dkt. No. 408. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

427 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Attached is the Court's revised draft preliminary
remarks to be recorded and played before each voir dire session. The Court is in
receipt of the Government's letter approving of the remarks, Dkt. No. 420, and the
Defendant's proposed additions, Dkt. No. 419. The revised remarks adopt all but one
of the Defendant's proposals because the Court's subsequent revisions eliminated that
portion of the script. In particular, the Court has made three additional changes in
order to accurately explain the logistics of voir dire. Each of these changes is reflected
in redline. The parties are ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 11,
2021 at 12:00 p.m. whether or not they have any objections or suggestions the Court's
revised preliminary remarks to be played before each voir dire session. Attached is
also the Court's revised draft voir dire in redline. The Court's revisions simplify the
phrasing of questions 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 25, and 37 in an effort to maximize the time
dedicated to questioning each prospective juror. The revision to question 11 reflects
the Court's oral ruling on November 1, 2021 regarding the use of pseudonyms for
certain witnesses. The revisions to questions 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 33 are
non−substantive changes to question numbers in order to accurately reference the
corresponding question numbers on the jury questionnaire or are grammatical changes.
Attached is also the Court's draft instruction sheet for those jurors who are not struck
for cause and will return for the exercise of peremptory strikes, as discussed at the
November 1 conference. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate by letter
on or before November 12, 2021 whether or not they have any objections or
suggestions to the revised voir dire and draft instruction sheet. Finally, the parties are
ORDERED to jointly submit the list of individuals and locations who may be
mentioned at trial for questions 11 and 12 of the voir dire on or before November 14,

431 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: As noted in its previous Order, the Court will hold
an in−person proceeding on November 10, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. Dkt. No. 409. The
proceeding will take place in Courtroom 110 of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse at 40 Foley

Defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, the
Defendant's motion in limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386, and
the other outstanding issues that overlap with these two motions as discussed at the
November 1, 2021 conference. As is expressly required by Federal Rule of Evidence
412, the Court must conduct a hearing on this motion in camera and seal the record of
the hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(2). Accordingly, this portion of the hearing will be
sealed and in camera. The Government confirmed that the attorneys for the alleged
victims implicated by the Defendants motion have been notified of their right to attend
the hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. Dkt. No. 430. For the public
portions of the proceeding, the Court will ensure access for alleged victims and any
members of the Defendant's family, in accordance with its prior Order. Dkt. No. 344.
Space will be available in the courtroom proper for members of the media. In order to
comply with the District's COVID−19 protocols, the public and additional members of
the media will be able to access the proceeding in overflow Courtrooms 506 and 905
of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse. These overflow rooms will have live video

and audio feeds of the proceeding. The use of any electronic devices during the
proceeding in the overflow rooms is strictly prohibited. The Court anticipates seating
capacity in the overflow rooms for 50 members of the public. If capacity is reached, no
additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID−19, anyone
who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of
the proceeding prior to entering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Only persons who meet the
entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below
100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All visitors must wear a mask
that covers the person's nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and masks with valves
are not permitted. If a person does not have an approved mask, a screener will provide
one. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been
adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions.

District of New York, Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse at 40 Foley Square, New
York, New York. In accordance with its prior Order, the Court will ensure access for

comply with the District's COVID−19 protocols, the public will be able to access the
proceeding in overflow Courtrooms 110 and 506 of the Thurgood Marshall U.S.
Courthouse. These overflow rooms will have live video and audio feeds of the

458 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
motion seeking clarification on two items from the November 1, 2021 pretrial
conference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification
about the line between permissible and impermissible cross−examination for witnesses
testifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to
permissible cross−examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the
Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross−examination. See United
States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). The line of questioning the
Government identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus
the Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on
cross−examination. As the Court noted at the November 1 conference, the Defendant
may not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment
may be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript at
11−12. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed
order regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November 18,

477 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On October 29, 2021, Defendant filed a motion in
limine to exclude evidence related to Accuser−3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court twice
heard argument related to this motion, including extensive argument at the November
10, 2021 in camera hearing that was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412.
See generally Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021 Transcript. The Court has also
considered supplemental briefing from the parties. That briefing has been filed
temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose redactions in
accordance with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In a Memorandum Opinion & Order filed under temporary seal, the Court GRANTS in
part and DENIES in part the Defendant's motion. The Memorandum Opinion & Order
lays out the permissible and impermissible testimony that may be offered by this
witness based on Rules 412, 404, 401, and 403. The Court will send the temporarily

690 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Before the Court is
the Defendant's fourth motion in limine to "exclude evidence related to Accuser−3," to
whom the Court refers as Witness−3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct
evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of
Evidence 404(b) and 403. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument
related to this motion, including argument at the November 10, 2021 in camera hearing
that was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See generally Nov. 1, 2021
Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021 Transcript. At the November 1, 2021 hearing, the Court
provided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then
before it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The
Court is now in receipt of the parties' additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to
resolve the motion.(See Footnote 1 on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The
Government now proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness−3 will describe
how she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.
In particular, Witness−3 is anticipated to testify how Defendant introduced her to Mr.
Epstein, how massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role
in facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information now before the Court,
including a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated
testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2−3 (Nov. 5, 2021); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42−43,
the Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct
evidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order
***]... The parties may submit any requested edits to the proposed limiting instructions
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page65 of 92

that are consistent with the Court's ruling or indicate that they have none on or before
November 21, 2021. This resolves Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions
that rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The
Government on November 8, 2021, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony
of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that
motion. On November 15, 2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude
the testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November
19, 2021. The Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written
opinion. In this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett
Gershman based on the parties' current proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion
& Order ***]... III. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's motion
to preclude Gershman's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre−trial
ruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's
analysis. In that event, the Defense must re−raise its request to admit Gershman as an
expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

seeks to admit what has been identified as Government Exhibit 52 ("GX 52"), and
submit to the jury a redacted version of GX 52. The Defense objects to the admission
of GX 52 on authentication and hearsay grounds. The admissibility of the exhibit has
been the subject of pretrial motion in limine briefing and extensive supplemental
briefing. See Dkt. Nos. 390, 397, 398, 457, 476, 490. This includes supplemental
briefing received on December 8, 2021, after the authenticating witness, Mr. Juan
Alessi, underwent direct examination by the Government and voir dire by the Defense.
The Court reserved ruling on the exhibit, pending what was anticipated to be
additional testimony. Trial Tr. at 876. The Court now overrules the Defenses
objections. The parties are ORDERED to confer and propose a limiting instruction
consistent with this ruling on or before today, December 9, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. The
parties are FURTHER ORDERED to confer and prepare a stipulation that Government
Exhibits 52A, 52D, 52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are true and correct photocopies of five
pages from GX 52. See Trial Tr. at 858. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

548 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
December 12, 2021, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a
pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a letter opposing this
request on December 14, 2021. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of
anonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permitted
three alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under
pseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's
motion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court
emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of
course raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning
into witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or
otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 133 (1968)
(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to
protect a witness "from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper
cross−examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him"). SO ORDERED.

Defense is ORDERED to submit a response as follows: − A response to the motion
with respect to Dr. Loftus by today, December 15, 2021, at 7:45 p.m. − A response to

admissible when the witness affirms that the 3500 material contains the inconsistent
statement and also expresses disagreement with the substance." The parties are hereby
ORDERED to submit a letter citing authority (beyond the rule itself) for their
respective positions. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate each disputed
prior inconsistent statement that was read into the record. Letters must be submitted as

Defense to move for a new trial in light of the issues raised in the parties' letters:
Defense motion: January 19, 2022; Government response: February 2, 2022; Defense
reply: February 9, 2022. The parties' briefing should address whether an inquiry of

Although the Court reserves decision on whether an inquiry of any kind is warranted,
the Court grants the Government's request, Dkt. No. 568, to offer court−appointed
counsel to the juror in issue. Subject to the juror's right to decline court−appointed
counsel, the Court will appoint the on−duty CJA counsel to represent the juror. If
counsel for the juror wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an
inquiry, briefing by the juror's counsel may be filed by January 26, 2022. The Court
will not adjourn post−trial briefing on other issues as requested by the Defense, Dkt.
No. 569, but sets the following schedule for any other post−verdict motion by the

575 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The parties are ORDERED to submit via email any
proposed redactions on or before January 13, 2022, justifying any such request by
reference to the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). If any redactions are
proposed, the Court will determine whether any are appropriate and then docket the
motion. The parties shall respond to Juror 50s motion on or before January 20, 2022.
Upon further reflection, unless and until Juror No. 50 is permitted to intervene, he may
have no standing to be heard on the question of whether an inquiry should be
conducted. Accordingly, the Court withdraws the aspect of its prior order setting
January 26, 2022, as the date by which counsel for Juror 50 should file a submission
on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry. Dkt. No. 571. The Court will hear
from the parties first regarding Juror 50's pending motion. Depending on the resolution
of that motion, the Court will provide further guidance to counsel for Juror 50
regarding any permitted submission. If a further submission is permitted, the Court
will provide ECF docketing access to counsel for Juror 50 at that time (Signed by

576 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court required the parties to indicate whether
Juror 50's motion to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors completed
questionnaire and voir dire should be redacted. Dkt. No. 575. In response, the parties
have submitted letters to the Court indicating their differing views on whether Juror
50s motion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Courtconcludes that
it must first address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permittedand/or
required before considering Juror 50s requests. Accordingly, the Court will not
consider or act on Juror 50's request to intervene and to be provided a copy of the
jurors completed questionnaire and voir dire until the Court receives the parties
briefing on the appropriateness of an inquiry and the nature of any such inquiry. The
Court will maintain Juror 50's motion temporarily under seal until the Court considers
the parties arguments and determines the appropriate next steps. Consistent with this

remains in place. The Court adopts the parties proposal that the scheduling of any
proceedings related to the severed perjury counts be deferred until the post−verdict
motions are resolved. By January 18, 2022, the Government shall indicate in a joint
letter whether it is seeking an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act for the
perjury counts and the basis for any requested exclusion. In the joint letter, the defense
shall indicate whether it consents to the proposed exclusion of time (Sentencing set for

the defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the time is necessary for the
parties to research and brief post−trial motions. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

584 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As a post−trial housekeeping matter, Court staff
directed the parties via email to complete the process of providing copies of Court
Exhibits with narrowly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity of
jurors and of witnesses the Court permitted to testify under pseudonyms) for the Court
to docket. The Government subsequently submitted one court exhibit with the name
unredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the
Defense indicated in a temporarily sealed letter why the name was unredacted. The
Government is accordingly ORDERED to docket a letter on ECF on or before January
28, 2022, indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this
witness. Once the Government confirms in that letter that it no longer seeks redaction
of the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed letter on the docket
without redaction of the name. The Court will then docket all Court Exhibits. (Signed
by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/26/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/26/2022)

01/26/2022
585 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a
new trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.
No. 580. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the
motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this matter and will
ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the
same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering
these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process
going forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the
Defendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense
requests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is
DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to
undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The
Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the public docket on or before
February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three−part test
in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The
Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification letter on or
before February 4, 2022. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial
motion is due February 2, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. Per the established practice in this case,
the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allow the Defense the
opportunity to propose narrowly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party
proposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a letter
justifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense
letter must be filed on or before February 8, 2022, and the Government letter must be
filed by February 11, 2022. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in
support, which is due February 9, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. If redactions or sealing are
proposed, the Defense letter justifying such requests would be due February 15, 2022,
and the Government letter would be due February 18, 2022. The parties are
FURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal
the filled−out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583. Letters by
both parties must be submitted via ECF on or before February 11, 2022. SO

Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page80 of 92

exhibits and the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed
redactions are consistent with the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly
tailored. The redactions serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of
victim−witnesses subject to the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit
4, rather than seal the entire document, the Court has redacted the information that
would potentially identify the victim−witness who testified pursuant to the Court's
anonymity order. Unredacted copies of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal.

596 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters
addressing the Defendant's request to temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and
accompanying exhibits, and the Governments response in opposition and
accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media organizations
have also filed letters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50's
motion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The
Defendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 50's motion. For the reasons
outlined more fully below, the Court rules as follows. First, the Defendant's motion to
temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a new trial is
DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrowly tailored to serve
competing interests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/11/22)(jw) (Entered:

607 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's proposed
redactions revised in response to this Court's order. See Dkt. Nos. 605, 606. The Court
has reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with
its prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 605. The narrowly tailored redactions further the
important interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror
anonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February 11 Order, these
interests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing
and specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly
reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming
hearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. 14 Cr. 6181
(EAW), Dkt. No. 312 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2017); id. Dkt. No. 329 at
38−39; Press−Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501,
511−12 (1984)). Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,
accompanying exhibits, and their January 13 letters, by February 25, 2022. The Court
will docket Juror 50's motion. As noted in its prior Order, following the Court's
resolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly
unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity
and privacy. See United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 146−47 (2d Cir. 1995); see
also Press−Enter. Co., 478 U.S. at 14. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

609 MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE AND

BEHALF OF PROPOSED INTERVENOR, JUROR 50 as to Ghislaine Maxwell re:
608 MOTION. (ap) (Entered: 02/24/2022)
02/24/2022
610 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &
Order, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the
important interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a
post−verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that
the demanding standard for holding a post−verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to
whether Juror 50 failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to
whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct,
unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do
not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses
during jury selection. Juror 50's post−trial statements are "clear, strong, substantial and
incontrovertible evidence that a specific, non−speculative impropriety"namely, a false
statement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123,
130 (2d Cir. 2018). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a
history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure
to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that
material information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the
demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of
any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to
the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing
and pre−hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page82 of 92

which the Court will question Juror 50 under oath. The Court further ORDERS that
Juror 50's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.
The Court will email counsel for Juror 50 a copy of his questionnaire and a copy of
this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the
questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the
Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance with
the Opinion & Order on or before March 1, 2022. The hearing will take place on
March 8, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 50 to appear in Courtroom
906 of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York,
New York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's
questions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public
access as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &
Order to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2022, the parties are ORDERED to
inform the Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order,
conforming any requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any
such request by reference to the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). (Status

640 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Per the Court's instruction at the March 8 hearing,
the parties submitted revised redactions to their briefing on the Defendants motion for
a new trial. The Court rejects the Defendant's proposed redaction to page 8, lines 6−7
of her reply because it is not necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror
anonymity and privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court concludes that the remaining
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to further the important interest of protecting
juror anonymity and privacy. Press−Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty.,

653 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 50
testified credibly and truthfully at the post−trial hearing. His failure to disclose his
prior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not
deliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the
Defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new
trial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial
pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the
presentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby
excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from today's
date through April 22, 2022. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting
this exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and
the Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post−trial motions
affect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January 10, 2022
letter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 650. The
Court will rule on the Defendant's remaining post−verdict motions in due course.
Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. This resolves docket numbers 613,
614, 642, 650, and 651. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/1/2022) (See ORDER

655 LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene
Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 25, 2022 re:
Advance PSR Deadline . Document filed by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell. (Rohrbach,
Andrew) (Entered: 04/25/2022)
04/26/2022
656 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
regarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.
No. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that
advancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their
sentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing
submission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,
the Court ORDERS the following schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2022 − First PSR
disclosure; May 31, 2022 − Defendant objections due; June 6, 2022 − Government
response due; June 9, 2022 − Second PSR disclosure; June 15, 2022 − Defendant
sentencing submission due; June 22, 2022 − Government sentencing submission due;
June 28, 2022 − Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/26/2022)(bw) (Entered: 04/26/2022)
04/29/2022
657 OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order
***]... V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's
Rule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness
testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the
Defendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury
instructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core
of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any
alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its
prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the
Defendant's motion based on pre−indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the
Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is
multiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is
multiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the
Defendant's participation in the same decade−long unlawful agreement with the
Defendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse
underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts
Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,
2022. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in
Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page87 of 92

682 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA)
"guarantees to the victims of federal crimes an array of substantive and participatory
rights, including the rights to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the
district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding, to confer
with the attorney for the Government in the case, and to receive full and timely
restitution as provided in law." United States v. Murillo−Bejerano (In re Rendon
Galvis), 564 F.3d 170, 174 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (cleaned up). "In any court
proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the
crime victim is afforded th[ose] rights." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). In accordance with
the procedure required by this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 671, the Government has
provided statements from seven individuals asserting they are crime victims under the
CVRA. As explained below, the Court will permit all seven individuals to provide
statements and the Defendant's request for redactions is denied....[*** See this Order
***]... In sum, all seven written statements received by the Court are deemed part of
the record. The Court will consider them only for what they permissibly may be
considered. The Government shall promptly docket the written statements without
redactions. Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre may present an in−person
statement at sentencing if they wish to do so. The Government shall provide copies of
this Order to counsel for the seven individuals who submitted statements by no later
than today, June 24, 2022. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

684 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defendant's letter in response to the Court's
order regarding the CVRA references a motion by Kate's attorney that accompanied
her impact statement. Dkt. No. 672 at 2 n.1. The Court is not in receipt of this motion.
The Government is ORDERED to docket the motion referenced by the Defendant as
soon as possible but no later than midnight tonight, June 26, 2022. SO ORDERED.

06/27/2022
686 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court has now received and docketed the full
set of submissions related to victim impact statements that were filed in accordance
with this Court's prior order. Dkt. No. 668. The Court received statements from Annie
Farmer, Kate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliette
Bryant, and Elizabeth Stein. As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its
discretion to permit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The
Court also denied the Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are
now part of the record. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675−1. Also as previously indicated in its order,
the Court will permit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral
statement at sentencing if they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having now
reviewed the full set of requests, and having heard from the Government that it does
not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court deems it feasible to exercise its discretion to permit
the remaining individuals who seek to themselves make an oral statement at
sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm, Sarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In
order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the anticipated length of the sentencing
proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding delay of sentencing, each individual
speaking orally may read a shortened version of their previously submitted written
statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to be responsible for ensuring
that anticipated statements conform to this requirement. The Government shall
promptly provide copies of this order to counsel for the eight individuals who
submitted statements. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

November 22, 2021 Memorandum Opinion & Order re Expert Witness Hall; −

Order re Response Schedule. The Court is now docketing those items. In order to
ensure a complete docket, the parties are ORDERED to confer and determine whether
any letters or briefing submitted to the Court without a redaction or sealing request
remain to be docketed. The Court has determined, for example, that the parties failed
to file on the docket their December 15 letter briefing and December 16 joint letter
regarding witness prior inconsistent statements. Any outstanding items, including any
proposed redactions, must be filed on ECF by July 12, 2022. SO ORDERED. (Signed

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
    Defendant-Appellant. 
------------------------------------------------------x 
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM, ESQ. declares under penalty of perjury, pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. §1746, as follows: 
1.  I am the attorney assigned by the Court to continue representation of 
appellant Ghislaine Maxwell on appeal and make this declaration in support of a 
motion to be relieved.  
2.  I was retained to represent Ms. Maxwell in the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with Indictment No. 20 
Cr. 330 (AJN).  Following jury trial, Ms. Maxwell was convicted of violations of 
U.S.C. 371, 1591, and 2423.   
3.  On June 28, 2022, the district court sentenced Ms. Maxwell to a term of 
imprisonment of 20 years, followed by a five-year term of supervised release, and 
imposed a fine of $750,000.00.  Detained since the date of arrest, Ms. Maxwell is 
presently serving her sentence.    
Case 22-1426, Document 14, 07/15/2022, 3348523, Page2 of 7

4.  I represented Ms. Maxwell throughout prosecution of her district court 
case, including jury trial and sentencing.  On July 7, 2022, I timely filed her Notice 
of Appeal. (See Exhibit A.) 
5.  I have not been retained to represent Ms. Maxwell on appeal, as indicated 
on the Notice of Appeal. (See Id.) 
6.  I am informed that Hon. John M. Leventhal (Ret.) of Aidala, Bertuna & 
Kamins, PC has been retained to represent Ms. Maxwell on appeal and will be 
filing notice of appearance today. 
7.  Since new counsel has been retained to represent Ms. Maxwell on appeal,  
I move to be relieved. 
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that the Court relieve Bobbi C. 
Sternheim, Esq. as continued counsel on appeal for appellant Ghislaine Maxwell.  
 I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 
Executed on: July 15, 2022.

Re: Briefing Schedule Request, USA v. Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-1426 
Dear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe, 
I am appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell.  I was not trial counsel 
for Ms. Maxwell.  I filed an Acknowledgement and Notice of Appearance on July 15, 2022.  The 
Clerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any 
information concerning the transcripts. 
Pursuant to Local Rule 31.2(a)(1)(A), the ready date for this case was July 15, 2022.  
Accordingly, I have until July 29, 2022, to file this briefing schedule request.  Pursuant to Local 
Rule 31.2(a)(1)(A), I can request no more than 91 days from the ready date as the deadline for 
filing Appellant’s Brief.  That date would be October 14, 2022. 
Pursuant to Local Rule 31.2(a)(1)(D), however, I am permitted to request a later deadline 
to file Appellant’s Brief if the case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.  
I request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 30, 2023, for the 
following reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions identified by the rule. First, as noted, 
I am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week.  As 
new counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to 
provide my client with the most competent and effective representation on appeal. Second, the 
record is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of transcript including pretrial hearings, 
voir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings.  In addition, the Docket Report consists 
of 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in 
limine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct 
my own research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance 
of prevailing on appeal.  This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size 
of Appellant’s Brief.  Fourth, I have not been able to meet with my client as she was prematurely 
transferred to Tallahassee, Florida by the Federal Bureau of Prisons over this past weekend, a 
Case 22-1426, Document 30, 07/28/2022, 3356263, Page1 of 2

matter of hours before my scheduled visit to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.  
Meeting with my client is a critical precondition to my work on this case. Fifth, I have other matters 
that I must work on as well, as Ms. Maxwell is not my only client. 
For these reasons, I respectfully request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief 
on January 30, 2023. 
Sincerely, 
John M. Leventhal

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Appellee,

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
------------------------------------------------------X 
Docket No.: 22-1426 
AFFIRMATION IN 
SUPPORT OF 
DEFENDANT-
APPELLANT'S 
MOTION TO EXTEND 
TIME TO FILE BRIEF 
JOHN M. LEVENTHAL, an attorney duly admitted to practice law in the State ofN ew 
York and a partner of the law firm of AIDALA, BERTUNA & KAMINS PC., attorneys for 
Defendant-Appellant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, hereby affirms the following statements, 
under penalties of perjury: 
1. 
That I am a partner at the law firm of AIDALA, BERTUNA & KAMINS P.C., 
attorneys for Defendant-Appellant, Ghislaine Maxwell (hereinafter "Appellant"), and as such, 
am fully familiar with the facts and circumstances of this action. 
3. 
On July 15, 2022, I filed a Notice of Appearance in this matter so that trial counsel 
could withdraw. 
4. 
On July 28, 2022, I filed a scheduling request asking that Appellant's brief be due 
on January 30, 2023, based on the size of the record. 
5. 
Soon after this Court granted our scheduling request, we were notified that the 
New York Court of Appeals had granted us leave on another matter which also involved a 
voluminous record and several issues oflaw which required substantial time and resources. 
6. 
The work of our small team of experienced appellate attorneys has been divided 
between these two cases. In addition, one of our appellate attorneys is dealing with a serious 
health condition. This has impacted his ability to work on the case. 
7. 
Another factor that has affected our ability to complete this brief by the current 
Case 22-1426, Document 40, 01/12/2023, 3451920, Page2 of 4

Case 22-1426, Document 40, 01/12/2023, 3451920, Page3 of 4
deadline of January 30, 2023, is the difficulty we have had communicating with our client who 
is incarcerated in Tallahassee, Florida, with limited phone access. 
8. 
We have been working diligently on this case and have identified several issues 
that we believe merit appellate review. However, there is still considerable work to be done. We 
find that we need an additional month beyond the cun-ent deadline to complete this important 
work responsibly. 
9. 
We believe that the above represents extraordinary circumstances that justify the 
relief sought. Denial of this application would cause in-eparable harm to our client. 
10. 
Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Rohrbach infonned me today that 
Respondent United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York does not 
object to the Court granting our motion for an additional one-month extension of time to file 
Appellant's brief. 
11. 
We respectfully request that the Court extend our time to file our brief to February 
28, 2023. We are cognizant that the Court warned that "[f]urther extensions of time will be 
disfavored." For this reason, we request only the additional time that we believe is absolutely 
necessary in order to effectively represent our client. 
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that this Court issue an Order granting 
Appellant's motion in its entirety, and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just 
and proper.

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS 
SECOND CIRCUIT 
X 	
Docket No.: 22-1426 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
- against - 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Appellee, 
AFFIRMATION IN 
SUPPORT OF  
DEFENDANT-
APPELLANT'S  
MOTION TO FILE  
AN OVERSIZED  
BRIEF 
Defendant-Appellant. 
 X 
JOHN M. LEVENTHAL, an attorney duly admitted to practice law in the State of 
New York and a partner of the law firm of AIDALA, BERTUNA & KAMINS PC., attorneys 
for Defendant-Appellant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, hereby affmns the following 
statements, under penalties of perjury: 
1. 	
That I am a partner at the law firm of AIDALA, BERTUNA & KAMINS P.C., 
attorneys for Defendant-Appellant, Ghislaine Maxwell (hereinafter "Appellant"), and as such, 
am fully familiar with the facts and circumstances of this action. 
3.
On July 15, 2022, I filed a Notice of Appearance in this matter. 
4.
On July 28, 2022, I filed a scheduling request asking that Appellant's brief be 
due on January 30, 2023, based on the size of the record. 
5.
On January 12, 2023, I filed a motion to extend time to file Appellant's brief to 
February 28, 2023, to which Appellee United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of New York had no objection. This motion is still pending. 
6.
Pursuant to Local Rule 32.1(a)(4), Appellant's principal brief must be no longer 
than 14,000 words. 
7.
Pursuant to Local Rule 27.1(e)(2), a party seeking to file an oversized brief must 
state the requested length and the reasons for exceeding this Court's limitations. 
Case 22-1426, Document 43, 01/16/2023, 3452785, Page2 of 4

8.
We request that the Court permit us to file a brief of no more than 20,000 words 
for the following reasons. 
9.
We plan to raise issues concerning evidentiary rulings by the trial court that we 
believe were erroneous. The rulings at issue require a detailed discussion of the evidence. The 
transcript is over 3000 pages and contains the allegations of multiple complainants. The legal 
issues cannot be raised by reference to a few discrete pages of the transcript; rather they go to 
cumulative prejudice resulting from the trial court's erroneous application of the Federal Rules 
of Evidence to the case. 
10.
In addition, we plan to raise issues pertaining to juror misconduct. This issue 
involves an exposition of facts and legal analysis pertaining to a juror questionnaire, voir dire, 
and a post-verdict hearing. It is, in itself, its own mini-trial. 
11.
We also intend to raise issues pertaining to a non-prosecution agreement; certain 
instructions to the jury; and sentencing. 
12.
A motion to file an oversized brief must be made no less than 14 days before the 
brief is due. Local Rule 27.1(e)3. Thus, we make this motion now, although our motion to 
extend time to file our brief is pending. 
13.
We have notified Appellee United States Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York today, by email to Assistant United States Attorneys Andrew Rohrbach, 
Lara Pomerantz, Alison Moe, and Maureen Comey, that we are making this motion and have 
asked their position and if they intend to file a response. We have not received a reply as of the 
time of filing. 
14.
For the reasons stated, we respectfully request that the Court permit us to file a 
principal brief of no more than 20,000 words and would consent to Appellee filing a brief of 
Case 22-1426, Document 43, 01/16/2023, 3452785, Page3 of 4

the same length. 
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that this Court issue an Order granting 
Appellant's motion in its entirety, and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just 
and proper.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all purposes.
In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested that the Court
schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this matter in the
afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID public health crisis,
there are significant safety issues related to in-court proceedings. If the Defendant is
willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be conducted remotely. To
that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant regarding waiving her
physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her physical presence for this
proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached form in advance of the
proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted remotely, there are protocols

at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times at which the Defendant could be
produced so that she could appear by video. In the next week, the Defendant could be
produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9, 2020 or sometime during the morning of
July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to meet and confer regarding scheduling for
this initial proceeding in light of these constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding
remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight, counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time
for the proceeding consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised
briefing schedule for the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in
this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers will
email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may
access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the
internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-
counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the
proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in advance of the
proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a
video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly
Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York,
NY. Due to social distancing requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when
capacity is reached no additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19
Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must
complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse.
All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse.
Please see the instructions, attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will
save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements
established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be
allowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be
worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have
been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no
exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible,
discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant
prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the
form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours
prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is unable to
obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an inquiry at
the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court to add the
Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the Government
must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the
rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to reasonable, accurate,
and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the crime or of any release...
of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the
district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The Court will inquire with the

Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate logistical arrangements
can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email within 24 hours in advance
of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on the question of detention
pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is
excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the
Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further
excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July 14, 2020. Due to the
logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the
ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported
by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, which will facilitate the
timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See

number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding for non-speaking co-counsel,
alleged victims, and any family members of the Defendant. The United States Attorney's
Office should email Chambers with information regarding any alleged victims who are
entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish
to be heard. The Court will then provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in
access. As the Court described in a previous order, members of the press and public may
watch and listen to the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick
Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID-
19, seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government may
contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims or family
members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in-house press corps may
contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating will be
allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y. COVID-
Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020. See Dkt.
No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing for in-person
viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public health, the Court
may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing, recording, or
rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law. Violation of these
prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of court issued media
credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any
other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison

LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Jeffrey S. Pagliuca dated
July 21, 2020 re: Local Criminal Rule 23.1 . Document filed by Ghislaine Maxwell.
(Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)
07/23/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting the
Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial statements
concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that counsel for all
involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this Court's local
rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional responsibility. In
light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further action is needed at
this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Accordingly, it
denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But the Court warns counsel and agents
for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to
take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The Court will
ensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a
fair trial will be safeguarded. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/23/2020) (ap)

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be followed
that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,
two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allowing her to
publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to
the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.
Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and
their counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the
criminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of
these issues. For the following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed
protective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the
court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other
appropriate relief." The good cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests,
including whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...
whether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the
public's interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). First,
the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with
regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and
witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a
general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the
privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the
disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the
protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the
defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or
potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see also United States v. Corley,
No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The
Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken
on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily
chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.
Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far
different matter than simply making a public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or
Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and

have no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant
privacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad
and risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that
is required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms.
Maxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this
case. It also allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe
may be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of
the investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter notes,
see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective
order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a
case-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their
counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case
are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been
many high-profile criminal matters that had related civil litigation. The Government
labors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court
expects the Government to scrupulously follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates
that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses
already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses
who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials
were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers
explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a
fair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed
protective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the November
25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the sealing request. On
November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no longer fully pressing the
unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and instead proposing redactions
to both the November 25th and November 30th letters. The Government has indicated
that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80. After due consideration, the Court will

adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions, which are consented to by the Government.
The Court's decision is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the
Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;"
(ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii)
balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting
disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir.
1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that
the Defendant's letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function
and useful in the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for
purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"),
F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law
presumption of access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put
forthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the
lettersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to
docket the redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons
outlined in the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court
DENIES the Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the
privacy interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will
permit the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly prepare a
briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for release on bail. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw) (Entered: 12/03/2020)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from
MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her request
that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to questions from
the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 91. Having
carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC legal counsel's
December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to summon the
Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt. No. 75.
Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall
continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions
of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials,
including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The
updates shall also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. The
Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 days.
Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant
continues to receive adequate access to her legal materials and her ability to communicate
with defense counsel. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/8/2020) (ap) (Entered:

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in accordance
with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The Government did not file
any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After due consideration, the Court
will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The Court's decision to adopt those
redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must:
(i) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the

enforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting
disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d
Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that
Defendant's letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and

the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d

access attaches. Id. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602
(1978). Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order
concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In
light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that should
not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose
any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by
reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and
Order should be redacted, the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.
As a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion
that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial detention continues to be
warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint
letter indicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such
proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/28/20)(jw)

106  OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to transport
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two
charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a lengthy bail hearing
on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court
concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or
combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwells
renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

168  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed the
brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the Court's
resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See Dkt. No. 162.
On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the
Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered
the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for
redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the
exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file
Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other
portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433, Dkt.
No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees no basis to file the transcript entirely under
seal rather than by redacting the relevant portions. In light of the above, the Government
is hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits,
consistent with this Order, or to file a letter with the Court justifying more tailored
redaction and sealing requests regarding pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by
no later than March 22, 2021. The parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and
jointly propose redactions to the Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's
proposed redactions by March 22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet,
confer, and propose redactions to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March
22, 2021 (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

169  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's third motion for
release on bail, Dkt. No. 160, is DENIED. The parties are ORDERED to meet and confer
and propose and justify any redactions to the Defendant's reply brief by March 24, 2021.
If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is ORDERED to docket
the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

172  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for
Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground
that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3) provides that "
[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or
confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court
order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the
court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or
modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). Consistent with the
Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel
to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be
disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an
opportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule
17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter from the law firm indicating that
it can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may
be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims
it represents. In that letter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of
the law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the
equivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the
Court can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion
to quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public
docket. See United States v. Ray, No. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) ("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal
or confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given
notice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the
Court will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on
grounds that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,
the law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with
defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.
The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March
26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing of objections,
defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within
three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order). Counsel shall
confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

203  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the parties' joint letter
responding to the Court's March 29, 2021 Order. The parties agree that the redactions to
pages 118 and 119 are no longer necessary. The Defendant continues to press for the
redactions on pages 129134. However, for the reasons stated in the Court's March 29,
2021 Order, the information is already part of the public record in this case and
accordingly the proposed redactions are unnecessary and overbroad. Dkt. No. 189; see
also United States v. Nejad, No. 18-CR-224 (AJN), 2021 WL 681427, at *11 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 22, 2021). For the reasons stated in the Court's March 18, 2021 and March 29, 2021
Orders, the Court approves the limited redactions to Exhibit 11 to the Government's brief,
except for the language quoted in the Indictment, which is already part of the public
record. The Government is therefore ORDERED to docket its omnibus memorandum of
law, along with the corresponding exhibits, by 3:00 p.m. today, consistent with the
Court's orders regarding redactions. The parties are further ORDERED to docket their
April 1, 2021 joint letter; if either side believes that portions of that letter should be
redacted, they shall propose redactions by April 19, 2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

205  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 15, 2021, the Defendant filed under seal her
reply briefs to the Government memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pre-
trial motions. She filed the briefs, along with the corresponding exhibits, temporarily
under seal in order to permit the Government and the Court to review certain proposed
redactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 did not
contain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 contain limited
proposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and 10 also contain exhibits that the Defendant
proposes be filed under seal. As set forth in the Defendant's cover letter, the premise of
the proposed redactions is that the materials were produced in discovery and subject to
the protective order that has been entered in this case. The mere existence of a
confidentiality agreement or a protective order covering judicial documents is insufficient
to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi Nissay Dowa Ins. Co. v. Prosight
Specialty Mgmt. Co., Inc., 12-cv-3274 (JPO), 2012 WL 3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.
21, 2012). And the Court did not receive specific requests or justifications to redact or
seal any of the materials. The Defendant is ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8,
9, 11, and 12 on ECF today, as she did not propose any redactions to these and the
Government has not voiced any opposition to these being filed without redactions. If
either side is seeking these or any other redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they
must file a letter indicating the redactions they request and providing specific
justifications for the sealing requests or redactions, in line with the principles set forth in
Lugosch. By April 20, 2021, the parties shall confer and submit a letter informing the
Court whether any redactions are being sought. If no redactions are being sought, the
Defendant is ORDERED to docket the remaining reply briefs on ECF by April 20, 2021.

207  OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-
count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey
Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 1994 to 1997. The Government filed
a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which contained only small,
ministerial corrections. The S1 superseding indictment included two counts of enticement

or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of the Mann Act and
two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two counts of perjury
in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July
12, 2021. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the S1
superseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully
briefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding
a sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of
Maxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress
evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal
exclusively with the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to
the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies
Maxwell's motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants
her motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further
expedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its
reasoning on the pages that follow:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:
The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by
the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment
delay (Dkt. No. 137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.
123), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike
surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.
121), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's
motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). The Court
ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence
related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 16
material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further
ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain
outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator
statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity
of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list.
The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or
supplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint
proposal to be submitted by April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall
submit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by
April 21, 2021 why her motion to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment under the Sixth
Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be denied as moot. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

216  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the
Defendant's motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part and
granted the Defendant' s motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt. No.
207. The Court will try the non-perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its Opinion, it
has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See Dkt. Nos.
133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government obtained by
subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her rights against
unreasonable searches and seizures, against self-incrimination, and to due process of law.
The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the
Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an order modifying the protective
order. The Court requires information from the Government for scheduling purposes. The
Government is ORDERED to inform the Court by letter docketed on ECF no later than
April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use any of the documents subject to the pending
motions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case. If the Government
does not intend to use any of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in
the trial of the non-perjury counts, the Court will defer consideration of those motions
until it has scheduled the trial of the perjury counts. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

232  MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on 222 LETTER by USA as to
Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey,
Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 20, 2021 re: Redactions
to Defense Reply Briefs and Exhibits. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the
Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided by the
three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,
435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the
documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against
the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes that these are judicial
documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach.
In balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, however, the
Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has put forward in this letter,
including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims,
favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050
(2d Cir. 1995). The Government's letter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By
April 23, 2021, the parties shall either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6,
which was originally filed under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no
redactions and file it on ECF. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

her response to the Court's April 21, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 221, under temporary seal with
proposed redactions. The proposed redactions are GRANTED. The Court's conclusion is
guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.
of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the

these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law
presumptions of access attach. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, however, the Court finds that the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of defense lawyers' clients in other
matters and to allow defense counsel to comply with their professional obligations under
the rules of professional conduct. The Defendant is ORDERED to docket the redacted
version of her letter by April 23, 2021. The Defendant is further ORDERED to docket the

264  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On April 21, 2021, the Court's Chambers received a
letter from counsel for a non-party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for his
client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The letter requests anonymity on behalf
of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the letter, the Court
forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to counsel, which it
has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 21, 2021 letter but will
file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non-party asserting that interest.
The Government is requested to forward this order to counsel for the non-party. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/3/21)(jbo) (Entered: 05/03/2021)
05/03/2021
265  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has received an exchange of letters that
pertain to an incident that took place on April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,
259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her
lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-
person attorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny
the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident
and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some
other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This
Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an
opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential attorney-client
communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to
take further action at this time. After receiving the defenses first letter motion, the Court
ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause why the Court should not grant the requested
relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in part defense counsels original request and
ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain questions about the April 24, 2021
incident and the procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells
lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense counsels current application is that
this Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of the in-person attorney-client
visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels
preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to
view or receive copies of those materials as a matter of law, they should be provided. To
the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that
application is denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms.
Maxwell has the opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in
light of all relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained
inmates in BOP custody. The isolated incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the
serious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way

undermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to
prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize the importance of this
going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. In furtherance of this, counsel for the
Government are ORDERED to confer with legal counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms.
Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-client communications as she
prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel shall promptly confer
with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to resolve any such
issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties may write to
the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific application
being made. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/3/2021) (ap) (Entered: 05/03/2021)
05/03/2021
266  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice justify
granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 to be
reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to
prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while
also ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary
or in the interests of justice. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by
May 10, 2021, they shall jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the
Clerk's Office (as is required by COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to
the earliest possible date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in order to
facilitate an early fall trial start date. The parties shall also discuss and propose any
adjustments necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government
may move in the letter for any requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act.

Court issue an order directing the MDC to accept two hard drives from defense counsel
that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in this case for Ms. Maxwell's use.
Dkt. No. 260. On May 4, 2021, the Court received the attached email from MDC legal
counsel indicating that MDC does not oppose the defense's request and that MDC staff
will coordinate with defense counsel so that Ms. Maxwell can receive the hard drives. In
light of this, defense counsel's April 30, 2021 request appears moot. Defense counsel
shall raise any further issues regarding their request within two weeks of this order.

Bobbi) (Entered: 05/11/2021)
05/11/2021
277  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has considered the parties' proposals
regarding the commencement of trial. Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the
Government's letter, the Court will request November 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office as
the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent
with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.
However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur
during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the
Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021. The Court finds that the
ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the
period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh the interests of the public
and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense
to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;
to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make
and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allow adequate time for the parties to
prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the
commencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the
Court can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial
commencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in
advance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall
meet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The
parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 30 minutes by phone
regarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint letter by May 14,
2021. The Court will accept only a joint letter with a joint proposal or with each sides
views briefly stated. The letter must attest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed
letters will be struck. SO ORDERED. (Time excluded from 5/11/2021 until 11/29/2021)

05/14/2021
282  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell
wrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with
particular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual
showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every 15 minutes at night.
Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is
disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand
trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal
counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In
response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates
as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with
cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 30 minutes.
Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night
at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,
flashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,
breathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral
reasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those
of other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and
the potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has
determined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The
Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable
policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover
her eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override
BOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check
procedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.

no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges
the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced. The
Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell
is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her
safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the
treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The Government shall provide a copy
of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed

284  MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 278 Letter Proposed Redactions
to Defendant's Supplemental Pre-Trial Motions... ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants in
part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is guided by the
three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,
435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and
that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. Id. at 11920.
In balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds
that the arguments the Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to
protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly
tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995).
Similarly, the Court concludes that the Government has shown that Exhibits E, F, G, H,
and I should be filed under seal. With respect to Exhibit C, however, the Court concludes
that narrowly tailored redactions are sufficient to advance the privacy interests the
Government has identified. Accordingly, the Government is ORDERED to confer with
defense counsel and submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/17/21)(jbo) (Entered: 05/17/2021)

06/25/2021
307  OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell moves to suppress evidence
obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation
against her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were
previously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her
rights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government
did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a
protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to
suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES
Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. 133, 139) (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan
on 6/25/21)(jw) (Entered: 07/01/2021)
06/30/2021
305  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2021 (Dkt.
No. 303), any proposed redactions to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to
suppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 30, 2021. Any proposed
redactions to the other documents ordered unsealed in that order must be filed no later
than July 2, 2021. The parties shall file a joint letter by each of these dates informing the
Court if no redactions are sought. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

The Governments request should be denied because (1) undersigned counsel does not
currently represent Ms. Maxwell, and (2) the Op-Ed did not violate the local rules. (jw)
(Entered: 07/12/2021)
07/30/2021
315  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government has moved for an order requiring
David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op-ed that he
authored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 309. Mr. Markus is
therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1. The Government does
not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and the Court declines to
consider whether it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack of clarity with respect to
whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule provides
illustrative examples of statements that "presumptively involve a substantial likelihood
that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the
due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule." S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal
Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated with the pending case
are now clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the purview of Local Criminal
Rule 23.1. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to Mr. Markus. This Court has
previously noted that counsel[,] agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No.
28. This Court is cognizant that criminal matters heading toward trial are especially
sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those associated with this case must act to ensure
the case is tried solely in court or else they risk being deemed responsible for any trial
delay or for undermining the integrity of the upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal
Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the impact it could have on this matter, failure to comply
could also result in attorney discipline. Id. Rule 23.1(i). (Signed by Judge Alison J.

08/13/2021
318  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 19, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted a sealed and ex parte motion for an order authorizing four subpoenas pursuant
to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. By sealed order dated March
22, 2021, the Court provided an opportunity for recipients of the subpoenas to respond to
the requests by March 30, 2021, but it received no responses. In an Opinion and Order
temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES Maxwell's motion without prejudice. It
does so after concluding that none of the proposed subpoenas conform to the factors first
set out in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 69870 (1974). The Court will send the
temporarily sealed Opinion and Order to defense counsel. By August 18, 2021, Maxwell
is ORDERED to inform the Court whether she seeks sealing or limited redactions of the
Court's opinion and of her original motion papers, justifying any such request by
reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date Maxwell shall
inform the Court whether she seeks full sealing or redactions of the original motion, again
justifying any such request by reference to the Lugosch test. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

08/13/2021

364  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the Court will implement the following procedures for jury selection: A
screening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and 12. The Clerk's
Office will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.
The list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.
Jurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their
assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to
defense counsel by the U.S. Attorney's Office. After reviewing the completed
questionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (1)
prospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors
that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not
the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the
Government, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires
completed on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists
for questionnaires completed on November 12 will be due to the Court via email by
November 13. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November 15 at 9:30
a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November 16-19. The Court will
conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties
and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the
potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See
Transcript at 1011. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrowly tailored
measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at 12.
The Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will
proceed on November 19 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures
taking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the
charges, and the District's COVID-19 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced
and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the
continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the
First Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons
stated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed
questionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after
jury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to
implement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see
Dkt. Nos. 28, 81, 95, 99, 101, 232, 241, 284, 301, 315, the defense did not justify sealing
the entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court's planned individual
voir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential
influence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to
propose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of
the specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

402  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's letter regarding

ORDERED to respond by Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. SO ORDERED.

10/31/2021
400  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion under
Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, and the Defendant's motion in limine to
exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386. The issues raised in the two
motions overlap significantly. The Court is required under Federal Rule of Evidence 412
to conduct an in camera hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412 ("Before admitting evidence under
this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and parties a
right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion, related
materials, and the record of the hearing must remain under seal.). In addition, the Court
has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the Defendant's motion
under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Because of the overlap in the substance of the
motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back. The Court previously
set a tentative date for the Rule 412 Motion hearing as November 5, 2021. Dkt. No. 354.
The Court is prepared to proceed with both hearings on that date. Alternatively, the
proceedings could be held on either the afternoon of November 9 or the afternoon of
November 10. The Government shall confer with its proposed expert regarding
availability for the Daubert hearing as well as with alleged victims who wish to attend
and be heard at the Rule 412 Motion hearing. After doing so, the parties shall confer with
each other as to availability. On or before November 2, 2021, the parties shall jointly file
a letter with the Court indicating whether the parties request that the hearings be held on
November 5, 9, or 10. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 10/31/2021)

401  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed
redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support,
and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the parties'
proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three-part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In

particular, for the reasons stated at today's conference, the Court denies the Government's
request to redact section ten of the Government's motion in limine. See Dkt. No. 380. The
Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general description of evidence or
anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to protect the privacy interests
of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties must propose more tailored
redactions consistent with the Court's discussion at today's conference. The parties are
ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email by November 4, 2021. In order
to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the Court requires the parties to submit the
proposed redactions as a single document and with the proposed redactions highlighted.
The Defendant's proposed redactions should be highlighted in one color, and the
Government's a different color. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions
expeditiously. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/1/2021)(bw)

412  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter dated

further with MDC legal counsel and file a letter regarding Defendant's transportation to
the courthouse for proceedings in this matter on or before November 8, 2021. The Court
hereby authorizes the letter to be filed under seal because such information may implicate

Southern District of New York and with the District Executive regarding transportation of
the Defendant for upcoming in court proceedings and trial. With respect to legal mail, the
Court requires MDC Legal Counsel to consider what additional steps can be taken

413  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motions for
reconsideration. See Dkt. Nos. 407, 408. The Government is hereby ORDERED to
respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 408, on or before November
8, 2021. As to the motion for reconsideration regarding the disclosure of juror names, the
Court reminds counsel of the following. First, as the Court previously indicated, the
lawyers will be provided the names of jurors on November 16, prior to the
commencement of the voir dire process. Second, the Court has now resolved the
logistical issues regarding the ability to conduct peremptory challenges on November 29
and the Court can now confirm that peremptory strikes will not be exercised until
November 29. Finally, as previously indicated, although only 40 qualified jurors are
needed for the exercise of peremptory strikes, the Court will seek to qualify
approximately 50 to 60 prospective jurors to return on November 29 for the exercise of
peremptory strikes. If counsel for either side learns of any additional information that
would be a basis for a strike for cause prior to November 29, they shall immediately raise
the issue with the Court. Bearing in mind this information, the Government is ORDERED
to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 407, on or before
November 4, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/3/2021)

417  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's
supplemental letter regarding its opposition to the defense motion to exclude evidence of
Minor Victim-3. See Dkt. No. 387. The letter is submitted temporarily under seal to allow
defense counsel the opportunity to propose any additional redactions beyond what the
Government proposes. At the November 1, 2021 conference, the Court asked the
Government to provide its position as to whether Alleged "Victim-3" could be considered
a "victim" of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for
purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). See Transcript at 71-72. The
Government's supplemental letter does not address this issue. While acknowledging that
the Court's request may have been unclear, the Government is now ORDERED to file a
supplemental letter responsive to the Court's question on or before 12:00 p.m. on
November 7, 2021. For the sake of clarity, the Government is directed to state its position
as to whether this anticipated witness could be deemed a victim of any of the crimes
charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for purposes of restitution
under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

426  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion for
reconsideration regarding release on bond, Dkt. No. 408, and the parties' letters regarding
the delivery of the Defendant's legal mail and transport to the courthouse for pretrial
conferences and trial in this case, Dkt. Nos. 381, 403, 422. For the reasons stated in this
Court's prior bail determinations, Dkt. Nos. 93, 106, 169, and the Government's letter in
opposition, Dkt. No. 423, the renewed request for bail is denied. Moreover, based on the
representations from MDC legal counsel regarding the delivery of the Defendant's legal
mail, Dkt. No. 422, the Court concludes that the Defendant has adequate access to legal
counsel and legal mail in order to prepare for trial. MDC legal counsel and the
Government are ordered to take the steps outlined in the Dkt. No. 422 between now and
the completion of trial. As to the Defendant's transport, the Court concludes that she will
be transported to and from the courthouse for pretrial conferences and trial in a way that
is humane, proper, and consistent with security protocols. This conclusion is based on
representations from MDC legal counsel in the letter submitted under seal because it
discusses BOP security protocols, see Dkt. No. 412, as well as the Court's communication
with the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York. The Government,
BOP, and USMS shall continue to take all available measures consistent with security
protocols to ensure the Defendant has sufficient rest, nutrition, and comfort in order to be

427  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Attached is the Court's revised draft preliminary
remarks to be recorded and played before each voir dire session. The Court is in receipt
of the Government's letter approving of the remarks, Dkt. No. 420, and the Defendant's
proposed additions, Dkt. No. 419. The revised remarks adopt all but one of the
Defendant's proposals because the Court's subsequent revisions eliminated that portion of
the script. In particular, the Court has made three additional changes in order to
accurately explain the logistics of voir dire. Each of these changes is reflected in redline.
The parties are ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 11, 2021 at 12:00
p.m. whether or not they have any objections or suggestions the Court's revised
preliminary remarks to be played before each voir dire session. Attached is also the
Court's revised draft voir dire in redline. The Court's revisions simplify the phrasing of
questions 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 25, and 37 in an effort to maximize the time dedicated to
questioning each prospective juror. The revision to question 11 reflects the Court's oral
ruling on November 1, 2021 regarding the use of pseudonyms for certain witnesses. The
revisions to questions 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 33 are non-substantive changes to
question numbers in order to accurately reference the corresponding question numbers on
the jury questionnaire or are grammatical changes. Attached is also the Court's draft
instruction sheet for those jurors who are not struck for cause and will return for the
exercise of peremptory strikes, as discussed at the November 1 conference. The parties
are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 12, 2021 whether
or not they have any objections or suggestions to the revised voir dire and draft
instruction sheet. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to jointly submit the list of
individuals and locations who may be mentioned at trial for questions 11 and 12 of the
voir dire on or before November 14, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

will take place in Courtroom 518 of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse at 40 Foley Square, New
York, New York. In accordance with its prior Order, the Court will ensure access for
alleged victims and any members of the Defendant's family. Dkt. No. 344. In order to
comply with the District's COVID-19 protocols, the public will be able to access the
proceeding in overflow Courtrooms 110 and 506 of the Thurgood Marshall U.S.
Courthouse. These overflow rooms will have live video and audio feeds of the
proceeding. The use of any electronic devices during the proceeding in the overflow
rooms is strictly prohibited. The Court anticipates seating capacity in the overflow rooms
for at least 50 members of the public. If capacity is reached, no additional persons will be
admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID-19, anyone who appears at any S.D.N.Y.
courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to entering
the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at the
courthouse. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the
questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter
the courthouse. All visitors must wear a mask that covers the person's nose and mouth.
Bandannas, gaiters, and masks with valves are not permitted. If a person does not have an
approved mask, a screener will provide one. Anyone who fails to comply with the

458  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
motion seeking clarification on two items from the November 1, 2021 pretrial
conference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about
the line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses
testifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to
permissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the
Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States
v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). The line of questioning the Government
identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not
limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the
Court noted at the November 1 conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a
specific employer, but the type and genre of employment may be relevant to the jury's
assessment of credibilty. Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript at 11-12. As to the second item, the

477  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On October 29, 2021, Defendant filed a motion in

690  MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Before the Court is
the Defendant's fourth motion in limine to "exclude evidence related to Accuser-3," to
whom the Court refers as Witness-3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct
evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence
404(b) and 403. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument related to this
motion, including argument at the November 10, 2021 in camera hearing that was sealed
pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See generally Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript; Nov.
10, 2021 Transcript. At the November 1, 2021 hearing, the Court provided a brief
explanation of its current position based on the information then before it, but the Court
ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The Court is now in receipt of the
parties' additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to resolve the motion.(See
Footnote 1 on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The Government now proffers that
the anticipated testimony of Witness-3 will describe how she met the Defendant and her
relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. In particular, Witness-3 is anticipated to
testify how Defendant introduced her to Mr. Epstein, how massages progressed to involve
sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role in facilitating those massages. Based on all of the
information now before the Court, including a substantially more detailed proffer by the
Government as to the anticipated testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2021); see
also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony
may serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum
Opinion & Order ***]... The parties may submit any requested edits to the proposed
limiting instructions that are consistent with the Court's ruling or indicate that they have

Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that motion. On November 15,
2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude the testimony of the remaining
six experts. The Defense filed a response on November 19, 2021. The Court addressed
the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written opinion. In this opinion, the Court
addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett Gershman based on the parties' current
proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... III. Conclusion. The
Court therefore grants the Government's motion to preclude Gershman's expert testimony.
Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at
trial would alter the Court's analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise its request to
admit Gershman as an expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

535  MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government
seeks to admit what has been identified as Government Exhibit 52 ("GX 52"), and submit
to the jury a redacted version of GX 52. The Defense objects to the admission of GX 52
on authentication and hearsay grounds. The admissibility of the exhibit has been the
subject of pretrial motion in limine briefing and extensive supplemental briefing. See
Dkt. Nos. 390, 397, 398, 457, 476, 490. This includes supplemental briefing received on
December 8, 2021, after the authenticating witness, Mr. Juan Alessi, underwent direct
examination by the Government and voir dire by the Defense. The Court reserved ruling
on the exhibit, pending what was anticipated to be additional testimony. Trial Tr. at 876.
The Court now overrules the Defenses objections. The parties are ORDERED to confer
and propose a limiting instruction consistent with this ruling on or before today,
December 9, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to confer and
prepare a stipulation that Government Exhibits 52A, 52D, 52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are
true and correct photocopies of five pages from GX 52. See Trial Tr. at 858. (Signed by

548  MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
December 12, 2021, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a
pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a letter opposing this request
on December 14, 2021. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of anonymity
for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permitted three alleged
victims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court
disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's motion....[*** See this

Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court emphasizes that while it currently
denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of course raise, and the Court will
consider, objections that particular lines of questioning into witnesses' backgrounds or
lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g.,
Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 133 (1968) (emphasizing that even when anonymity is not
warranted, the court has a duty to protect a witness "from questions which go beyond the
bounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him"). SO

many of these statements raise one of two questions: (1) must counsel show the witness
the prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b), and (2) is a statement admissible
when the witness affirms that the 3500 material contains the inconsistent statement and
also expresses disagreement with the substance." The parties are hereby ORDERED to
submit a letter citing authority (beyond the rule itself) for their respective positions. The
parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate each disputed prior inconsistent statement
that was read into the record. Letters must be submitted as soon as possible but no later

Subject to the juror's right to decline court-appointed counsel, the Court will appoint the
on-duty CJA counsel to represent the juror. If counsel for the juror wishes to be heard on
the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry, briefing by the juror's counsel may be filed
by January 26, 2022. The Court will not adjourn post-trial briefing on other issues as
requested by the Defense, Dkt. No. 569, but sets the following schedule for any other

575  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The parties are ORDERED to submit via email any
proposed redactions on or before January 13, 2022, justifying any such request by
reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). If any redactions are proposed, the Court
will determine whether any are appropriate and then docket the motion. The parties shall
respond to Juror 50s motion on or before January 20, 2022. Upon further reflection,
unless and until Juror No. 50 is permitted to intervene, he may have no standing to be
heard on the question of whether an inquiry should be conducted. Accordingly, the Court
withdraws the aspect of its prior order setting January 26, 2022, as the date by which
counsel for Juror 50 should file a submission on the issue of the appropriateness of an
inquiry. Dkt. No. 571. The Court will hear from the parties first regarding Juror 50's
pending motion. Depending on the resolution of that motion, the Court will provide
further guidance to counsel for Juror 50 regarding any permitted submission. If a further
submission is permitted, the Court will provide ECF docketing access to counsel for Juror
at that time (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/12/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/12/2022)

576  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court required the parties to indicate whether
Juror 50's motion to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors completed
questionnaire and voir dire should be redacted. Dkt. No. 575. In response, the parties
have submitted letters to the Court indicating their differing views on whether Juror 50s
motion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Courtconcludes that it must
first address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permittedand/or required
before considering Juror 50s requests. Accordingly, the Court will not consider or act on
Juror 50's request to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors completed
questionnaire and voir dire until the Court receives the parties briefing on the
appropriateness of an inquiry and the nature of any such inquiry. The Court will maintain
Juror 50's motion temporarily under seal until the Court considers the parties arguments

place. The Court adopts the parties proposal that the scheduling of any proceedings
related to the severed perjury counts be deferred until the post-verdict motions are
resolved. By January 18, 2022, the Government shall indicate in a joint letter whether it is
seeking an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act for the perjury counts and the
basis for any requested exclusion. In the joint letter, the defense shall indicate whether it
consents to the proposed exclusion of time (Sentencing set for 6/28/2022 at 11:00 AM
before Judge Alison J. Nathan.) (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/14/22)(jw)

docket. The Government subsequently submitted one court exhibit with the name
unredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the Defense
indicated in a temporarily sealed letter why the name was unredacted. The Government is
accordingly ORDERED to docket a letter on ECF on or before January 28, 2022,
indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this witness. Once
the Government confirms in that letter that it no longer seeks redaction of the name, then
the Defense may file the temporarily sealed letter on the docket without redaction of the
name. The Court will then docket all Court Exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan
on 1/26/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/26/2022)
01/26/2022
585  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a
new trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.
580. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.
The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this matter and will ensure that
the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the
Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues
in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one
be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,
interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing
should themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can
be made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or
redaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the
public docket on or before February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by
reference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d
Cir. 2006). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification
letter on or before February 4, 2022. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new
trial motion is due February 2, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. Per the established practice in this
case, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allow the Defense
the opportunity to propose narrowly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party
proposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a letter
justifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense
letter must be filed on or before February 8, 2022, and the Government letter must be
filed by February 11, 2022. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,
which is due February 9, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. If redactions or sealing are proposed, the
Defense letter justifying such requests would be due February 15, 2022, and the
Government letter would be due February 18, 2022. The parties are FURTHER
ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal the filled-out
questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583. Letters by both parties must
be submitted via ECF on or before February 11, 2022. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge

593  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: As a post-trial house-keeping matter, attached to this
Order are the Court Exhibits. The parties have proposed redactions to several exhibits and
the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed redactions are
consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly tailored. The redactions
serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of victim-witnesses subject to
the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit 4, rather than seal the entire
document, the Court has redacted the information that would potentially identify the
victim-witness who testified pursuant to the Court's anonymity order. Unredacted copies
of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

596  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters addressing
the Defendant's request to temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying
exhibits, and the Governments response in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See
Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media organizations have also filed letters seeking
unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50's motion to intervene. Both the
Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The Defendant seeks to strike or, in
the alternative, seal Juror 50's motion. For the reasons outlined more fully below, the
Court rules as follows. First, the Defendant's motion to temporarily seal in their entirety
all documents related to the motion for a new trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial
documents must be narrowly tailored to serve competing interests. (Signed by Judge

has reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with its
prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 605. The narrowly tailored redactions further the
important interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror
anonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February 11 Order, these interests
justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing and specific
factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly reported in the
press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming hearing. Dkt. No.

(ap) (Entered: 02/24/2022)
02/24/2022
610  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order,
a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the important
interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is
high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard
for holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 50 failed to
respond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual
abuse. Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple
media outlets about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that
cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 50's post-trial
statements are "clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,
non-speculative impropriety"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.
United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2018). To be clear, the potential
impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the
jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury
selection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could
be explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is
not met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a
hearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request
for a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a
hearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 50 under oath. The Court further
ORDERS that Juror 50's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the
Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 50 a copy of his questionnaire
and a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will
conduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant
and the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance
with the Opinion & Order on or before March 1, 2022. The hearing will take place on
March 8, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 50 to appear in Courtroom 906
of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New
York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's
questions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public
access as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &
Order to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2022, the parties are ORDERED to inform
the Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming
any requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any such request by
reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). (Status Conference set for 3/8/2022 at

639  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As indicated at yesterday's hearing, the Court has
docketed the unredacted copy of the Court's February 24, 2022, Opinion & Order, the
Government's proposed questions, the Defendant's proposed questions with limited
redactions, the signed immunity order with limited redactions, and Hearing Exhibit 1.
The limited redactions to the signed immunity order and the Defendants proposed
questions are narrowly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity. The
Court will file the unredacted documents under seal. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/9/22)(jbo) (Entered: 03/09/2022)
03/10/2022
640  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Per the Court's instruction at the March 8 hearing, the
parties submitted revised redactions to their briefing on the Defendants motion for a new
trial. The Court rejects the Defendant's proposed redaction to page 8, lines 6-7 of her
reply because it is not necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity and
privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court concludes that the remaining proposed redactions
are narrowly tailored to further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and
privacy. Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501, 511-12
(1984). The parties are ORDERED to file the redacted briefs (with the above noted line
unredacted) on the docket on or before March 11, 2022. The Court will file the
unredacted briefs under seal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/10/2022)(jw)

653  OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 50
testified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior
sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.
The Court further concludes that Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the Defendant and
could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under
McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33
is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation
report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy
Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2022. The
Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial
computations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on
these counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations
set forth in the Government's January 10, 2022 letter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant
consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 650. The Court will rule on the Defendant's
remaining post-verdict motions in due course. Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28,
2022. This resolves docket numbers 613, 614, 642, 650, and 651. (Signed by Judge

656  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
regarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.
No. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that advancing
the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their sentencing
submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing submission
schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly, the Court
ORDERS the following schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2022 - First PSR disclosure;
May 31, 2022 - Defendant objections due; June 6, 2022 - Government response due; June
9, 2022 - Second PSR disclosure; June 15, 2022 - Defendant sentencing submission due;

657  OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...
V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29
motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and
documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based
on constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's
evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the
Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,
because the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the
Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based
on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to
multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count
Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count
Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in
the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,
Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will
enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing
date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. The Court previously set a schedule for
sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.

686  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court has now received and docketed the full set
of submissions related to victim impact statements that were filed in accordance with this
Court's prior order. Dkt. No. 668. The Court received statements from Annie Farmer,
Kate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliette Bryant, and
Elizabeth Stein. As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its discretion to
permit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The Court also denied
the Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are now part of the
record. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675-1. Also as previously indicated in its order, the Court will
permit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral statement at sentencing
if they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having now reviewed the full set of requests,
and having heard from the Government that it does not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court
deems it feasible to exercise its discretion to permit the remaining individuals who seek
to themselves make an oral statement at sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm,
Sarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the
anticipated length of the sentencing proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding
delay of sentencing, each individual speaking orally may read a shortened version of their
previously submitted written statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to
be responsible for ensuring that anticipated statements conform to this requirement. The
Government shall promptly provide copies of this order to counsel for the eight
individuals who submitted statements. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

726  ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed
redactions to motions that were not previously docketed. See Dkt. No. 698. With one
exception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to
protect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 412 and the privacy interests of witnesses,
including individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were
anticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch
v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court will file unredacted
copies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, however, that the proposed
redactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrowly tailored. The private information of victim-
witnesses who are discussed in the letter may be protected by narrow redactions.
However, there is no basis to redact the letter's general request to identify the proper
scope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the
Government and docket proposed revised redactions on or before 12:00 p.m. on Friday,
July 15, 2022. The letter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 712.
Because the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is
respectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 712 from the docket. The Court's
Chambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three
joint letters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not
docketed. Because docketing the letters would not undermine the important interest of
protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three
letters on or before 12:00 p.m. on Friday, July 15, 2022. Finally, to ensure a complete
record, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been
docketed nor subject of a sealing request: November 19, 2021 Administrator Feldman's
Motion to Quash Defendant's Rule 17(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2021
Defendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule 17(c)(3) subpoena
December 6, 2021 Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify
December 15, 2021 Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December 13, 2021 Motion to Call
Counsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for
the relevant movants and indicate on or before 12:00 p.m. on Friday, July 15, 2022,
whether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any
documents not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.
Any proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga. This resolves Dkt. No.

that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the identities and privacy
interests of victim-witnesses who were subject to the Courts anonymity order. See
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court will file

3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and

Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page119 of 208

victims to the movies or shopping . 
Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim . 
b . 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by , among other things , discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed , and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims ' 
interactions with Epstein , including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein , helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. 
For example , in some instances , MAXWELL would 
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim . 
In other instances , 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude . 
Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims . 
d. 
In addition , Epstein offered to help some 
minor vict ims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities , and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein ' s assistance . 
As a result, victims were made to feel

indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to

20-cr-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around 
1994 to 1997.  The Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, 
which contained only small, ministerial corrections.  The S1 superseding indictment included 
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of 
the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses.  It also included two 
counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition.  Trial is set to 
begin on July 12, 2021. 
Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the S1 superseding 
indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery.  After the parties fully briefed those 
motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking 
count and another related conspiracy count.   
This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than 
those seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and 
this Opinion, deal exclusively with the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues

related to the newly added sex trafficking charges.  For the reasons that follow, the Court denies 
Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part.  It grants her 
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial.  It denies her motion to further expedite 
discovery. 
The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the 
pages that follow: 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between 
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.  The Court 
concludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely.  The Court concludes that the 
Government brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly 
delay in bringing them. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the 
alternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail.  The 
Court concludes that the charges are specific enough. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony 
responded to ambiguous questioning and was not material.  The Court concludes that 
these issues are best left for the jury. 
• 
Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can 
proceed in a separate trial.  The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will 
try the perjury counts separately.   
• 
Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous 
and to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant.  The Court concludes that 
these motions are premature before trial.  
• 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories 
of evidence.  The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will 
order Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than 
Manhattan, returned the S1 superseding indictment.  Because a jury in Manhattan 
returned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.

I. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution 
In September 2007, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey 
Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the Office of the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142 at 1-2.  Epstein agreed in the NPA to 
plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen 
months in a county jail.  Id.  In exchange, the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed not to charge him 
with federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his 
conduct between 2001 and 2007.  Id. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of 
his “potential co-conspirators.”  Id. 
As a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility 
observed, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.  
OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 204-3, at x, 80, 175, 179, 260–61.  The U.S. Attorney’s 
promise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal 
practice for federal plea agreements.  This provision appears to have been added “with little 
discussion or consideration by the prosecutors.”  Id. at 169, 185.  The report concluded that the 
U.S. Attorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct, 
but nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.”  Id. at 169. 
Only the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court.  Maxwell 
contends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of 
Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal 
limitations.  The Court disagrees for two independent reasons.  First, under controlling Second 
Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York.  Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 3 of 34
A-140
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page144 of 208

A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York 
United States Attorneys speak for the United States.  When a U.S. Attorney makes a 
promise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal 
government to fulfill it.  See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); United States v. 
Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558 (2d Cir. 1996).  The question here is not whether the U.S. Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida had the power to bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York.  The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so.  Applying Second Circuit 
precedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not. 
In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the 
office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”  771 F.2d 670, 672 
(2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  This is something akin to a clear statement rule.  Single-district plea 
agreements are the norm.  Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception.  Applying 
Annabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from 
this ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United 
States.”  United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. 
Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004).  Those are common shorthand.  A plea 
agreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
and-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where 
signed. 
Maxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion.  The provision of the NPA 
dealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Attorneys in other 
districts.  It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts.    The relevant language, in 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 4 of 34
A-141
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page145 of 208

its entirety, reads as follows: “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt. No. 142-1 at 5.  Under Annabi, 
Salameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no 
restriction on prosecutions in other districts. 
Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of 
Florida.  The first states that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer 
“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement.  Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2.  The 
second states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against 
Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions.  Maxwell contends 
that the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any 
geographical limitation.  If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly 
limited to the Southern District of Florida.  It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively 
apparent”, Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672,—that the parties intended to drastically expand the 
agreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators 
without clearly so saying.   
Without an  affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation 
history.  Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA 
between the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts.  See United 
States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).  She alleges that officials in the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA 
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and communicated with attorneys in other 
districts.  Any involvement of attorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have 
been minimal.  Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 5 of 34
A-142
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page146 of 208

about the NPA’s negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence 
that the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA.  The OPR report 
reflects that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was 
signed when Epstein tried to get out of it.  OPR Report at 103.  Other documents show that 
attorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory 
assistance but not for help negotiating the NPA.  Dkt. No. 204-2.  Nor would direct approval of 
the NPA by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General change the meaning of its terms.  No 
evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-
conspirators in other districts.  Absent such a promise, it does not matter who did or did not 
approve it. 
Second Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only 
the U.S. Attorney’s office for the district where it was signed.  Maxwell identifies nothing in the 
NPA’s text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption.  The Court thus concludes that the 
NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
B. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses 
The NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the S1 superseding 
indictment even against an office bound to follow it.  The NPA bars prosecution, following 
Epstein’s fulfillment of its conditions, only for three specific categories of offenses: 
(1) “the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2” of the NPA; namely, “any offenses that 
may have been committed by Epstein against the United States from in or around 
2001 through in or around September 2007” including five enumerated offenses; 
(2) “any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office”; and 
(3) “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation.” 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 6 of 34
A-143
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page147 of 208

Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2.  The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to 
and deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2001 and 2007. 
Maxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the 
offenses covered.  The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation.  The phrase 
“potential co-conspirator” means nothing without answering the question “co-conspirator in 
what?”  The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who 
conspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those 
offenses.  Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein 
from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office 
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation. 
The Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA.  
Those charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from 
depositions in 2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA.  Maxwell now 
concedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in its 
entirety, perjury counts and all. 
  The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA’s scope.  The S1 
superseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994 and 1997, some 
four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the 
NPA.  The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes committed 
before the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation.  
Maxwell’s protection is no broader.  The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the 
offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 7 of 34
A-144
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page148 of 208

C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
In the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct 
an evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA.  The Court finds no basis to do so. 
The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement 
mostly involved oral agreements where there was no written record of the full set of terms 
reached by the parties.  All of them involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of 
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise.  “An oral agreement greatly 
increases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the 
terms, of the deal.”  United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002).  Thus, an 
evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never committed to 
writing.  This is no such case.  The NPA’s terms are clear.  Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive 
OPR report details its negotiation history.  No record evidence suggests that prosecutors 
promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing.  The Court agrees with the 
Government that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.   
For the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA.  In any case, it 
appears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her 
motion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log.  Of course, the Government’s 
disclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or 
evidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under 
the NPA.  The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any 
evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose, 
and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.

II. 
The indictment is timely 
A. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations 
Federal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses.  18 
U.S.C. § 3282(a).  Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children, 
Congress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor.  18 U.S.C. § 3283.  Until 2003, the operative version 
of § 3283 allowed prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.   
Congress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-
21, 117 Stat. 650, to allow prosecution any time during the life of the victim. 
The parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act, 
but untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2003 
version of § 3283.  Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the 
general statute of limitations.  Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2003 version of § 3283 
applies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2003.  The Court concludes that statute of 
limitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely. 
1. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors 
Maxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the S1 superseding indictment involve 
the sexual abuse of minors.  The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the 
alleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for 
that purpose.  Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each 
statutory offense.  See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 221 (1953).  In Maxwell’s view, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 9 of 34
A-146
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page150 of 208

for example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity 
and not follow through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential 
ingredient of the offense.  Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related 
conspiracy charges. 
This approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate 
prior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes.  See Taylor v. United States, 495 
U.S. 575, 602 (1990).  Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look 
only to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the 
provision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.”  Descamps v. 
United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Whether a statute 
requires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation.  To 
determine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the 
abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text, 
context, and history.”  United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2327 (2019). 
Though it has not authoritatively settled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly 
suggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one.  In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 
48, 58–60 (2d Cir. 2017), the Second Circuit discussed at length how the text, context, and 
history of § 3283 show that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific 
approach.  The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 801 
F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015).   
The Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten.  First, “[t]he 
Supreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction 
contexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 10 of 34
A-147
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page151 of 208

To the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is 
inappropriate here. 
The Court begins with the statute’s text.  Statutes that call for application of the 
categorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.  
Id. at 59.  “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal 
elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.  That linguistic expansion indicates Congress 
intended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.”  Id. at 
59–60 (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283).  Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but 
that case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns.  See United States 
v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  The Supreme Court has likewise held that a 
statute which uses the language “an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to 
the victim or victims exceeds $10,000” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”   
Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (emphasis added).  Thus, the word “involves” 
generally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as committed in each 
case.  This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to 
apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children.  See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60; 
Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196. 
The purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either.  For statutes 
dealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It 
promotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions 
in minitrials conducted long after the fact.”  Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 200–01 (2013).  
In the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the 
first instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.”  Weingarten, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 11 of 34
A-148
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page152 of 208

865 F.3d at 60.  Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283 
would be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements 
of the offense.  It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some 
additional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least, 
when the alleged conduct took place).  This is not a serious practical problem and does not 
justify setting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.  
Maxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953), to urge this 
Court to cast Weingarten aside.  The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended 
the limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War.  In that 
case, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing 
was not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as 
required by the statute.  Id. at 221.  Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that 
the offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.”  Id. at 222.  It reached that 
conclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress 
intended it to apply only to a narrow class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss.  Id. at 216. 
As the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the 
enacting in the PROTECT Act.  Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. 10.  “In passing recent statutes 
related to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress 
‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as 
possible.”’”  Id. at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 
F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc))).  The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—
legislative history supporting a narrow interpretation—does not exist here.  Instead, both the 
statute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 12 of 34
A-149
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page153 of 208

Based on the statute’s text, context, and history, the Court follows Weingarten and 
concludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse 
of a minor on the facts alleged in this case.  There is no question that they did.  The Court thus 
concludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here. 
2. The 2003 amendment to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses 
Maxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the 
PROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to 
her alleged offenses.  Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in 
Weingarten.  Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the 
view Maxwell now takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions 
of at least two other circuit courts.  Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773 
F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 
2006). 
The Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal 
statute applies to past conduct.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994).  
Courts look first to the language of the statute.  If the statute states that it applies to past conduct, 
courts must so apply it.  Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.  Otherwise, the statute applies to past 
conduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects.   Id.  
The Court begins with Landgraf’s first step.  To assess a statute’s meaning here, courts 
must consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including 
the statute’s history and structure.  See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter. 
Mortg. Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 406 (2d Cir. 2004). 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 13 of 34

Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page154 of 208

Section 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of 
limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution 
during the life of the child.”  The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have 
held that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute.  See Leo Sure Chief, 
438 F.3d at 923.  The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to 
prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment.  Instead of simply providing a 
new limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that 
would otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply.  That is, it prevents the 
application of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct. 
Courts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.  
The Eighth Circuit has held that the 1994 amendments to § 3283, which allowed prosecution of 
sex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct.  See 
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684–85 (8th Cir. 2005).  The Second Circuit has observed 
that the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-26, 105 Stat. 123, 
illustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct.  See Enter. Mortg. 
Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 391 F.3d at 407.  That statute eliminated the statute of 
limitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the 
period within which suit may be filed.”  Id.  The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar. 
The history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period 
as broadly as the Constitution allows.  With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress 
further extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be 
difficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 14 of 34
A-151
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page155 of 208

Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.  Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act 
because it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.”  H.R. Conf. 
Rep. No. 108-63, at 54 (2003).  For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not 
be prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as 
the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.”  Id. 
 Maxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text.  Instead, she contends that 
because the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its 
final form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past 
conduct.  However, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity 
provision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results.  The 
Supreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex 
Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations 
does not.  Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632–33 (2003).  Senator Leahy, who co-
sponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a committee report that the proposed 
retroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the 
government’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.”  149 Cong. Rec. 
S5137, S5147 (Apr. 10, 2003) (statement of Sen. Leahy).  Congress removed the provision 
shortly thereafter for this reason.  The removal of the express retroactivity provision shows only 
that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including 
past conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.  
Both the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it 
applies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the S1 superseding indictment.  The Court could stop here.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 15 of 34
A-152
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page156 of 208

However, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to 
these charges. 
At Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past 
conduct would have impermissible retroactive effects.  “[A] statute has presumptively 
impermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under 
existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in 
respect to transactions or considerations already past.’”  Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting 
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 290).  Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-
barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect.  Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. 
Litig., 391 F.3d at 407.  Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet 
expired does not.  Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir. 1995).  
Maxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when 
Congress enacted the PROTECT Act.  Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.  
Maxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that 
occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a 
lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all.  It has done so here, judging that the 
difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a 
defendant’s interest in repose.  Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy 
judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute.  The Court concludes that 
§ 3283 allows her prosecution now. 
B. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process 
“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the 
primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’”  United States v. Cornielle, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 16 of 34
A-153
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page157 of 208

171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 
322 (1971)).  There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of 
limitations is valid.  To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a 
defendant must show both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an 
improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the 
charges.  See id.  This is a stringent standard.  “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have 
shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses 
prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.”  DeMichele v. 
Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790–91 (2d Cir. 1999). 
The Court sees no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was 
designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.  However, it is enough to say that 
Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.  
Maxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests 
because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or 
destroyed.  It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference 
in her case. 
Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away.  These include 
Jeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged 
victims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida.  She contends 
they all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today.  Courts have 
generally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable 
testimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay.  See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388 
F. Supp. 2d 396, 399–400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).  The Court agrees with this approach.  Maxwell 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 17 of 34
A-154
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page158 of 208

provides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to.  The 
testimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach 
investigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to 
establish her innocence of the charged offenses.  There are also serious doubts under all of the 
relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he 
had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.  See United States v. 
Spears, 159 F.3d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1999).   
Maxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility 
of missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons.   These are 
difficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and 
they do not justify dismissing an indictment.  United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325–26 
(1971); see United States v. Elsbery, 602 F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1979). 
Finally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has 
garnered.  Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her 
reputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator.  And she also alleges—without 
evidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations.  The Court will 
not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a 
perjurious conspiracy against her.  And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the 
pretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury. 
The Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the 
Government’s delay in bringing charges.  She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial 
shows otherwise.  On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due 
process bars the charges here.

III. 
The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity 
Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative 
to compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges.  
The Court concludes that the charges in the S1 superseding indictment are clear enough. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain “a plain, 
concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.”  
The indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the 
defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events.  United 
States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992).  “Under this test, an indictment need do 
little more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in 
approximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d 
Cir. 1975).  In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity 
the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to 
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second 
time for the same offense.”  United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). 
The S1 superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts 
supporting each element.  Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague 
because it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and 
“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.   
Maxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and 
place of charged conduct “in approximate terms.”  Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113.  The details are 
subject to proof at trial.  “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 19 of 34
A-156
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page160 of 208

to describe the window of when a violation occurred.”  United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 
364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 
1987)).  “This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse 
of underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses.”  United States v. 
Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (collecting 
cases).  As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time, 
and witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when 
abuse occurred.  The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct. 
Maxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges 
impermissibly vague.  The Court disagrees.  Rule 7 requires only that the language of the 
indictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of 
the crime.  Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113.  The language of the S1 superseding indictment does so. 
The Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper 
Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.  Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is 
not inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the 
charges. 
Finally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not 
provide the names of the alleged victims.  The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged 
victims’ names be included the indictment.  The names of victims, even if important, generally 
need not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant.  See United 
States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 
369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Maxwell likely knows the identity of the alleged victims described in the 
indictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive discovery on them. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 20 of 34
A-157
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page161 of 208

Moreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial.  There is thus 
no unfairness here.  See Stringer, 730 F.3d at 126.  As discussed below, the Court will require 
the parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
IV. 
The perjury charges are legally tenable 
The Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from 
her answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case.  She contends that these charges are 
legally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions 
were not material to the subject of the deposition.  The Court concludes that the charges are 
legally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury. 
The applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any 
proceeding before or ancillary to any court . . . knowingly makes any false material declaration.” 
U.S.C. § 1623(a).  Testimony is perjurious only if it is knowingly false and is material to the 
proceeding in which the defendant offered it. 
A. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge 
The requirement of knowing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is 
false.  United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 1986).  As a general matter, “[a] jury is 
best equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.”  Id.  
Courts have acknowledged a narrow exception for questions that are so fundamentally 
ambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false.  Id. at 372, 375; see also 
United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. 1970).  A question is fundamentally 
ambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context.  Lighte, 782 F.2d 
at 375.   The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a 
witness who understood the question. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 21 of 34
A-158
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page162 of 208

At a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature.  Courts typically evaluate whether a 
question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at 
trial.  See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992).  The evidence at 
trial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in 
context or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them.  In any event, the Court has closely 
considered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous.  None of the 
alleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The 
context of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead 
a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious.  Truth and falsity are 
questions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases.  The Court declines to usurp the jury’s 
role on the limited pretrial record. 
B. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material 
Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the 
allegedly false statements were material to the defamation action.  In a civil deposition, a 
statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer 
might reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  United States v. Gaudin, 515 
U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, 753–54 (2d Cir. 1994).  Like knowing 
falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury, 
not the court.”  Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 465 (1997).  Only the most extraordinary 
circumstances justify departure from this general rule.  United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d 
406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 522–23).     
The charged statements do not fall within this narrow exception.  Maxwell contends that 
the questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 22 of 34
A-159
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page163 of 208

civil case, but that is not the legal standard.  The Government may prevail if it proves that 
Maxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the 
factfinder in the civil case.  See Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509; Kross, 14 F.3d at 753–54.  At trial, a 
reasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permitted the 
plaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiff’s 
testimony.  The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial 
resolution.  In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the ‘inviolable function of the 
jury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is 
inextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that 
dispute on a Rule 12(b) motion.”  United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d Cir. 2018).  
The Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately 
presented to the jury. 
V. 
The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately 
Although the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of 
justice require severing those counts and trying them separately.  Trying the perjury counts 
together with the Mann Act counts would require admitting evidence of other acts likely to be 
unduly prejudicial.  It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their 
involvement in the earlier civil case. 
Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a court to order separate 
trials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant.  A defendant seeking 
severance must show significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting 
multiple trials.  United States v. Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998).  The harm to the 
defendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 23 of 34
A-160
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page164 of 208

one.”  United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. 1980).  Though this standard is 
demanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell 
meets it here.  Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of 
her choice and risk an unfair trial. 
Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on 
each set of counts.  First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would 
potentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.  In particular, a 
joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil 
litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.  This presents a 
significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find 
guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.  See United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 
422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978).  Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice 
the jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of 
the perjury counts.  The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to 
mitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved. 
Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of 
Maxwell’s attorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf.  The perjury counts likely 
implicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom 
represent her in this case.  The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a 
lawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a 
witness.  N.Y. R. Prof’l Conduct § 3.7(a).  Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the 
deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts.  Even if counsel were not 
required to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 24 of 34
A-161
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page165 of 208

counsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the 
Mann Act charges. 
The Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party’s attorney 
presents serious risks to the fairness of a trial.  See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 173, 
178 (2d Cir. 2009).  The lawyer might appear to vouch for their own credibility, jurors might 
perceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between 
argument and evidence might confuse the jury.  Id.  Disqualification of counsel also implicates 
Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Kincade, No. 15-cr-00071 (JAD) (GWF), 2016 WL 6154901, at *6 (D. Nev. 
Oct. 21, 2016).  The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the attorneys who 
represented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with 
the facts surrounding the criminal prosecution.  See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 
1064, 1070–71 (2d Cir. 1982). 
The Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial 
participants.  But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does 
not overlap.  In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and 
evidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here.  See Kross, 14 F.3d at 
753–54; Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509.  Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to 
both sets of charges, many are not.  At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far 
beyond the narrower issues presented.  And while the Court agrees with the Government that at 
least some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is little question that the jury’s 
consideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time 
and resources to provide the requisite context.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 25 of 34
A-162
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page166 of 208

The balance of these considerations favors severance.  “Motions to sever are committed 
to the sound discretion of the trial judge.”  United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d 
Cir. 1989).  In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will 
best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.  
VI. 
Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature 
Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the S1 
superseding indictment as surplusage.  The Court declines to do so at this juncture. 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a court to strike surplusage from an 
indictment on a defendant’s motion.  “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be 
granted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are 
inflammatory and prejudicial.”  United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(cleaned up).  Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the 
presentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect how 
specific allegations relate to the overall charges.  See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. 18-cr-224 
(AJN), 2019 WL 6702361, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2019); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. 
Supp. 2d 451, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   
Maxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage 
because the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or 
was below the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place.  Thus, she 
argues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an attempt to 
introduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes. 
The Court will not strike any language from the S1 superseding indictment at this 
juncture.  The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 26 of 34
A-163
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page167 of 208

clearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged.  United States v. Napolitano, 552 
F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982).  The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim 
traveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein.  But the 
Court cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the 
charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind.  See United 
States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992).  The Court will follow the well-worn 
path of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial.  Maxwell may renew her motion 
then. 
VII. 
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature 
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the S1 superseding 
indictment as multiplicitous is also premature.  Maxwell contends that the Government has 
alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment.  “An indictment is multiplicitous when it 
charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, 
only one crime has been committed.” United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999).  
“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, 
which assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple 
punishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987) 
(cleaned up).   
“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does 
not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one 
punishment is eventually imposed.”  United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 
2006).  “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to 
dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.”  United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 27 of 34
A-164
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page168 of 208

(PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014) (collecting cases).  The Court therefore 
denies Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice. 
VIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it 
has in its possession and has failed to produce.  She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the 
Government’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator 
statements, and Rule 404(b) material.  Based on the Government’s response in briefing and 
letters the parties have since submitted to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have 
been overtaken by events.  Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not 
entitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will 
require the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
A. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all 
Brady and Giglio Material 
The Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. 
United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain 
evidence that will aid their defense.  Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence.  Under 
Giglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also 
information that could be used to impeach a key government witness.”  United States v. Coppa, 
267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154).  As a general rule, “Brady and 
its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material 
upon request by a defendant.”  Id. at 146.  “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in 
time for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law 
simply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.”  Id. at 144. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 28 of 34
A-165
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page169 of 208

Maxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio 
material and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to 
disclose.  The Court begins with the specific requests.  The requested materials include (1) 
records of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response 
to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a 
personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the 
Government has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case. 
The Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has 
reviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents 
includes exculpatory information not previously disclosed.  The Court has no reason to doubt the 
Government’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with them.  And because the witness statements are 
covered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the 
terms of the statute.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145.  Next, the Government 
represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and 
so that request is moot.  The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third 
party, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.  
See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Finally, Maxwell’s 
request for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal 
basis.  Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents. 
The Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and 
Giglio material.  The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady 
and that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations.  The Court has no 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 29 of 34
A-166
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page170 of 208

reason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus 
far in this case.  The Government has agreed in its recent letter to produce Giglio material six 
weeks in advance of trial.  The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a 
schedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively 
prepare for trial.  See Coppa, 267 F.3d at 144. 
B. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements 
Maxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory 
statements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial.  The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3500, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of 
discovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.”  Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145.  The 
statute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of 
witness statements unless those statements are exculpatory.  “A coconspirator who testifies on 
behalf of the government is a witness under the Act.”  In re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d 
Cir. 1987).  The Court therefore lacks the inherent power to expedite these disclosures.  In any 
case, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance 
of trial. 
The Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the 
admissibility of co-conspirator declarations.  Co-conspirator statements may often be admitted at 
trial on a conditional basis.  If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden 
to show that the conditionally admitted statements were made in furtherance of the charged 
conspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a 
mistrial.  United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993).  Although conditional 
admissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 30 of 34
A-167
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page171 of 208

has committed to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to 
allow Maxwell to raise any objections.  Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any 
proffered co-conspirator testimony following the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures. 
C. Witness list 
As a general matter, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the 
identity of government witnesses.”  United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1975).    
In deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a 
defendant has made a specific showing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the 
defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.”  United States v. 
Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139–140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up).   
Maxwell has made a particularized showing that the Government must produce a witness 
list reasonably in advance of trial.  The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old 
allegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of 
the defense.  However, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford 
Maxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allows Maxwell 
significantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this 
District.  See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 
580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (fourteen days before trial).  In addition, on April 13, 2021, the 
Government produced over 20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related 
to non-testifying witnesses.  After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the 
issues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of 
discovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 31 of 34
A-168
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page172 of 208

D. Rule 404(b) material  
Maxwell’s final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government 
seeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).  Under Rule 404(b), if the prosecutor in a 
criminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the 
prosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the 
prosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form 
during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.”  The Government 
represents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in 
advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final 
pretrial conference.  The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge 
admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s attention any issues that require resolution 
before trial.  “This is all that Rule 404(b) requires.”  United States v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378 
(AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013).  The Court concludes this schedule is 
generally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of 
trial is strongly encouraged.  
The Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude 
the parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account 
for Maxwell’s specific concerns.  “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to 
the benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.”  United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 
(2d Cir. 1974).  In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus 
schedule to propose to the Court.  The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above 
materials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 207   Filed 04/16/21   Page 32 of 34
A-169
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page173 of 208

Given the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the 
Court encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks. 
IX. 
The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell’s grand jury challenge 
The Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of 
the S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.1  However, Maxwell’s 
motion seeking to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury 
sitting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot.  Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury 
drawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the 
community, because her trial would proceed in the Manhattan Division.  A grand jury sitting in 
Manhattan returned the S2 superseding indictment.  By April 21, 2021, Maxwell shall show 
cause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis.  
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein’s 
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the 
statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No. 
137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the 
perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to 
dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial 
disclosures (Dkt. No. 147).  The Court GRANTS Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury counts 
for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). 
The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any available additional or supplement rulings in 
light of the filing of the S2 indictment.

Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page174 of 208

The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers 
any evidence related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 
material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. 
The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial 
disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including 
co-conspirator statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the 
identity of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government’s witness list. 
The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental 
motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be 
submitted by April 21, 2021.  If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their 
respective proposals. 
The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why her motion to 
dismiss the S1 superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be 
denied as moot. 
SO ORDERED.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell,  
Defendant. 
20-cr-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On April 16, 2021, the Court issued an Opinion & Order granting in part and denying in 
part Ghislaine Maxwell’s various pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the 
Government’s (S1) superseding indictment and compel discovery.  Prior to the issuance of that 
Opinion & Order but after the motions were fully briefed, a grand jury returned a second (S2) 
superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and sex trafficking conspiracy count.  The 
Court did not address the new charges in the April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.  On May 25, 
2021, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the S2 indictment in 
whole or in part and to compel discovery.  Dkt. No. 292, 293.  For appeal preservation purposes 
or otherwise, the arguments largely, though not entirely, rehash the positions rejected by the 
Court in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.  To the extent new arguments are made, they are 
addressed below.  All pending motions are DENIED.  The Court provides a brief summary of its 
conclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follow: 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey 
Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement.  The Court again concludes, as it did in its April 
16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of New York.

Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page192 of 208

• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on 
those counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The Court 
concludes that Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for these offenses and 
therefore her prosecution on these counts does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six as untimely.  The Court again concludes, 
as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the Government brought the 
charges within the applicable statute of limitations.  
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as 
multiplicitous.  The Court again determines, as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & 
Order, that this motion is premature and denies it without prejudice for renewal at trial.   
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the S2 indictment for pre-indictment delay.  The Court again 
concludes, as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that Maxwell has not 
established that she suffered prejudice and therefore any delay has not violated her 
rights to due process.  
• 
Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars related to counts five and six because they are 
too vague, and in particular do not provide specific dates.  The Court again concludes, 
as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the charges are sufficiently 
specific.   
• 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce the statements of “Minor-Victim 
4” in the S2 indictment as Brady material.  The Court concludes that the current 
disclosure schedule gives Maxwell sufficient time to make effective use of any such 
statements and therefore immediate disclosure is not warranted.  
I. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar the charges in the S2 
indictment 
In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order on Maxwell’s first set of pretrial motions, the 
Court held that the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar the charges against Maxwell in 
the S1 superseding indictment.  See United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-cr-330 (AJN), 2021 WL 
1518675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2021).  Maxwell now renews those arguments for the charges 
in the S2 superseding indictment.  The Court understands the primary purpose of Maxwell’s 
renewed motion to be to preserve these arguments for appellate review, and the Court denies the 
A-189
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page193 of 208

renewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April 16 opinion.  The Court 
will proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor 
the supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not 
bar the charges against her. 
As the Court explained in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in 
United States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States 
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”  771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  
The Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has followed it steadfastly since.  
See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v. 
Brown, No. 99-1230(L), 2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002); United States v. 
Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 916, 
923 (2d Cir. 1988).  The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in 
Epstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea 
agreements.  See Salameh, 152 F.3d at 120.  Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus 
concluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of New York.  It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it 
would otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment. 
Maxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this 
reasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a letter of supplemental authority.  
See Dkt. Nos. 293, 310.  In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception 
for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.”  And in 
the letter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme 
A-190
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page194 of 208

Court in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2020, 2021 WL 2674380 (Pa. June 30, 2021), 
requires dismissal.  Neither argument is persuasive. 
Annabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are 
“identical to the dismissed charges.”  In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second 
Circuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based 
on the plea agreement in that case.  See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672.  In that section of the opinion, 
the Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the 
defendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the 
charges that were dismissed under the plea agreement.  Nothing in Annabi suggests that the 
presumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another 
district are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case 
applying Annabi has so held.  Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this 
Court. 
The Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result.  To begin with, this 
Court must follow the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law, 
not those of a state court.  Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second 
Circuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA.  In any event, 
the state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here.  In 
Cosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district attorney to proceed with charges against Bill 
Cosby after the district attorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally 
promised that it would not charge him.  Cosby, 2021 WL 2674380, at *34.  That case did not 
involve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea  
agreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district.  Instead, the 
A-191
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page195 of 208

case focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be 
clear in the absence of a formal plea agreement.  Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in 
Cosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case. 
After considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and letter of supplemental 
authority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.  Under 
Second Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
New York.  It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment. 
II. 
This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy 
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same 
offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  “This protection 
applies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal 
offense.”  United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993).  “A defendant may only raise a 
Double Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘attached’) sometime 
before the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.”  United States v. Podde, 105 F.3d 813, 816 (2d Cir. 
1997).  A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the 
defendant’s entry of a guilty plea.  Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (1978); Morris v. Reynolds, 
264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2001).  Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the 
Government is free to commence a prosecution. 
Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.  
She concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense.  She was never 
charged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation.  She 
agreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it.  She suffered no criminal 
consequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court.  To the contrary, there is 
A-192
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page196 of 208

no indication that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation.  The Double Jeopardy 
Clause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has 
endured neither.  Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her. 
Despite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is 
immune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy.  The 
cases she cites, however, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same 
conspiracy, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2004).  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-
conspirators be tried together for related offenses.  See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 
(1993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d 1002, 1014 (2d Cir. 1976).  Whether the Government 
could have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the 
Double Jeopardy Clause. 
Maxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent 
prosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her 
husband pleaded guilty.  Dkt. No. 293 at 19 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 609 
F.2d 603 (2d Cir. 1979)).  However, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in 
Cambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double 
Jeopardy Clause.  See Cambindo Valencia, 609 F.2d at 638.  No precedent stands for the 
proposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator 
accepts a non-prosecution agreement.  This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in 
jeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.

III. 
Counts five and six are not time-barred  
For most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.  
U.S.C. § 3282(a).  Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in 
particular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in 18 
U.S.C. § 3283.  Prior to 2003, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the 
age of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the 
PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat 60.  In 2006, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 and for some other sex crimes.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding 
any other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without 
limitation for any offense under . . . section 1591.”).  
In her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the 
indictment were time-barred on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not 
applicable.  The Court denied that motion in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.  Maxwell, 2021 
WL 1518675, at *5.  Maxwell now argues that the new charges the Government has brought 
against her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 371) and Sex 
Trafficking (18 U.S.C. § 1591), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply to those 
offenses either.   She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period 
in § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and 
argues that a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 does not.  Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning, 
the general five-year statute of limitations period in 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex 
trafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2001 to 2004, the Government 
is now time-barred for prosecuting her for these offenses.   
A-194
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page198 of 208

The Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its 
April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.  As an initial matter, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s 
analysis of § 3283 is incorrect.  As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a  
“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s 
conduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor.  Maxwell, 2021 WL 
1518675 at *5-7.  Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity 
that constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.   
But in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief – and as Maxwell did not 
contest in her reply – § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex 
trafficking counts.  As discussed above, in 2006, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether 
the limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § 1591.  See 18 
U.S.C. § 3299.   
Moreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have 
occurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2006, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless 
applies retroactively to cover that conduct.  In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court 
analyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994) framework 
and concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations 
period had not yet expired.  Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *7-8.  Similar to § 3283, which 
states that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the 
language of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses 
“[n]otwithstanding any other law.”  As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect 
to § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply 
retroactively to prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment so long as the 
A-195
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page199 of 208

applicable limitations period has not yet run – offenses that by definition are those for which 
“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3299.  Moreover, 
as the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require 
retroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not 
revive time-barred claims.  Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *7-8.  The Court therefore joins 
multiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to 
offenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run.  See United States v. Nader, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 619, 629 (E.D. Va. 2019); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 CR 541 (CM), 
2018 WL 4043140, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018); United States v. Vickers, No. 13-CR-128-A, 
2014 WL 1838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:08-CR-253 
(WWE), 2010 WL 2351484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2010).   
The sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred.  Regardless of whether it was 
the general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual 
abuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the 
enactment of § 3299 in 2006, neither had expired by that date.  Thus, as Maxwell does not 
contest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the 
Government is permitted to bring those charges without time limitation.  
IV. 
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as 
multiplicitous is premature  
In her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the S1 
indictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are 
multiplicitous.  In the Court’s April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court joined many other 
courts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United 
States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 2006), and the Court dismissed without 
A-196
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page200 of 208

prejudice.  Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *14.  In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues 
that count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either 
counts one or three.  Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the 
Court’s April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.  
V. 
The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process  
Maxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper 
pretrial delay.  In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion, 
concluding that her efforts to show actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent 
standard” necessary to prevail on such a claim.  Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *9.  Maxwell’s 
motion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons.  As before, nothing in the 
record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart 
Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.  However, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does 
not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.  Maxwell 
contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because 
potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or destroyed.  It 
is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case. 
The Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April 16, 2021 Opinion & 
Order, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in 
bringing charges.  She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shows otherwise.  On 
the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges 
here. 
A-197
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page201 of 208

VI. 
No bill of particulars is warranted  
Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars as to counts five and six.  Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 7 requires that an indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite written 
statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged[.]”  The indictment must be 
specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the defendant to plead double 
jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events.  See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 
F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992).  “Under this test, an indictment need do little more than to track the 
language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged 
crime.”  United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d Cir. 1975).   
“Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to seek a bill 
of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending 
against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose 
a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.”  United 
States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987).  “The purpose of a bill of particulars is to 
supplement the allegations in the indictment when necessary to (1) enable the defendant to 
prepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair surprise to the defendant at trial, and (3) preclude a second 
prosecution of the same offense.” United States v. Mandell, 710 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 
2010)).  On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the 
Government from restricting its proof at trial.  See United States v. Rajaratnam, No. 09-cr-1184 
(RJH), 2010 WL 2788168, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 13, 2010).   
In her previous motions, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act counts in the indictment 
should be dismissed for lack of specificity or that, in the alternative, the Court should compel the 
Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges.  Maxwell 
A-198
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page202 of 208

contended specifically that the indictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended time 
periods for the Mann Act counts.  The Court disagreed in light of Circuit precedent requiring 
only that an indictment describe the time and place of the charged conduct in “approximate 
terms” and permitting the use of “on or about” language to describe the window of when a 
violation occurred.  Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *10 (citing Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113; 
United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 1987)).  The Court explained that 
approximate time periods are particularly appropriate if the allegations involved ongoing conduct 
and especially if the indictment alleges sexual abuse against minor victims.  Id. (citing United 
States v. Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008)).  
Maxwell now again moves for a bill of particulars.  Maxwell primarily argues that the S2 
indictment does not provide specific dates for the conduct alleged with respect to the sex 
trafficking counts.  Instead, the S2 indictment provides a four-year time period from 2001 to 
2004 in which the alleged sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy occurred.  Maxwell’s 
motion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court’s April 16, 2021 Opinion 
& Order.  The indictment alleges ongoing conduct that involve the sexual abuse of minors with 
respect to counts five and six and therefore the approximate time period provided is sufficient. 
Accordingly, the motion for a bill of particulars is denied.1   
VII. 
The current disclosure schedule for impeachment material is adequate  
Finally, Maxwell moves to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor Victim’s 
prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell, including prior statements made to the 
Additionally, Maxwell includes in her motion for a bill of particulars a request to require the 
government to identify the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies 
charged in the S2 indictment.  Maxwell also made this request in the parties’ joint May 21, 2021 letter to 
the Court regarding the disclosure schedule.  Dkt. No. 291.  In both her motion and the May 21, 2021 
letter, Maxwell requests that this information be disclosed to the defense at the same time that the 
Government discloses Jencks Act material.  The Government has not opposed this request.  In the absence 
A-199
Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page203 of 208

FBI.  The Court has ordered the Government to disclose all Jencks Act and Giglio material by 
October 11, 2021.  Dkt. No. 297 at 1.  That date is seven weeks in advance of trial.  The Court 
sees no reason to depart from the rule in this district that impeachment material of anticipated 
witnesses does not warrant an order compelling immediate disclosure.  See United States v. 
Campo Flores, No. 15 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2016 WL 5946472, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2016).  
Seven weeks in advance of trial is far more time than is standard in this district and no showing 
has been made that it will be insufficient for Maxwell to make effective use of the information in 
preparation of her defense. 
To the extent Maxwell argues that the Government is in possession of prior statements 
that are exculpatory under Brady (for example, if a witness denied Maxwell’s involvement), 
rather than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Government’s 
obligation to “disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes 
known to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the 
preparation of its case.”  Dkt. 68 at 1.  The context of questions and answers surely matters as to 
whether a statement (or omission) is exculpatory, impeaching, or neither.  It is for the 
Government to make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its disclosure obligations so that 
the defense may make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial.  See United 
States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 144-46 (2d Cir. 2001).  The Government has repeatedly 
confirmed that it understands those obligations, and that it has met them and will continue to 
meet them.  Accordingly, the motion to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor 
Victim-4’s prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell is denied. 
of objection, the Court presumes the Government intends to disclose this information to Maxwell at the 
same time that as it discloses Jencks Act material.

Case 22-1426, Document 57, 02/28/2023, 3475900, Page204 of 208

Conclusion 
For the reasons above and in this Court’s April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court 
DENIES Maxwell’s motion to obtain relief specified in her supplemental pre-trial motions 
relating to the S2 indictment.  This resolves Dkt. No. 292.

travel across state lines with the intent that she would engage 
in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a 
crime under the penal law of New York State, namely, New York 
Penal Law Section 130.55.  I instruct you as a matter of law 
that sexual abuse in the third degree -- the offense set forth 
in Count Two of the indictment -- was a violation of New York 
State Penal Law from in or about 1994, up to and including in 
or about 1997, at the time the acts are alleged to have been 
committed. 
A person violates New York State Penal Law Section
130.55, sexual abuse in the third degree, when he or she
subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter's
consent.  Under New York law, "sexual contact" means any
touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for
the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party.
It includes the touching of the victim by the actor, whether
directly or through clothing; as well as the emission of
ejaculate by the actor upon any part of the victim, clothed or
unclothed.  
Also under New York law, lack of consent can result 
from incapacity to consent.  A person less than 17 years old is 
deemed incapable of consenting to sexual contact under New York 
law.  Thus, the law deems sexual contact with a person less 
than 17 years old to be without that person's consent even if, 
in fact, that person did consent.  However, in order to find

that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the 
victim's age, you must find that Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was 
less than 17 years old. 
Instruction No. 18.  Count Four.  Transportation of an
individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual
activity.  The statute.
The relevant statute for Count Four is Title 18,
United States Code, Section 2423(a), which provides that a
person who "knowingly transports any individual under the age
of 17 years in interstate commerce, with the intent that such
individual engage in any sexual activity for which any person
can be charged with a criminal offense" is guilty of a federal
crime.
Instruction No. 19.  Count Four.  Transportation of an
individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual
activity.  The elements.
In order to prove the defendant guilty of Count Four,
the government must establish each of the following three
elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt:
First, that the defendant knowingly transported an
individual in interstate commerce as alleged in the indictment.
Second, that the defendant transported the individual
with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual
activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal
offense under New York law as alleged in the indictment.

LCKVMAX8                 Charge
And third, that the defendant knew that the individual
was less than 17 years old at the time of the acts alleged in
Count Four of the indictment.  Count Four also relates solely
to Jane during the time period 1994 to 1997.
Instruction No. 20.  Count Four.  Transportation of an
individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual
activity.  First element.
The first element of Count Four which the government
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell
knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce as alleged in
the indictment.  The phrase "to transport an individual in
interstate commerce" means to move or carry or cause someone to
be moved or carried from one state to another.
The government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell 
personally transported Jane across a state line; it is 
sufficient to satisfy the element that Ms. Maxwell was actively 
engaged, either personally or through an agent, in the making 
of the travel arrangements such as by purchasing tickets 
necessary for Jane to travel as planned.  Ms. Maxwell must have 
knowingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in 
interstate commerce.  That means that the government must prove 
that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be 
transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate 
commerce.  As I've explained, an act is done knowingly when 
it's done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of

accident, mistake, or some innocent reason. 
It is the defendant's intent that matters here.  If
the government establishes each of the elements of the crime
beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant is guilty of this
charge whether or not the individual agreed or consented to
cross state lines.
Instruction No. 21.  Count Four.  Transportation of an
individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual
activity.  Second element.
The second element of Count Four which the government
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell
knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the
intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person
can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York
law.
Like Count Two, Count Four alleges sexual activity for 
which an individual could be charged with a violation of New 
York Penal Law, Section 130.55, sexual abuse in the third 
degree.  I've already instructed you regarding that crime, and 
those instructions apply equally here. 
In order to establish this element, it's not necessary
for the government to prove that the illegal sexual activity
was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for transporting Jane across
state lines.  A person may have several different purposes or
motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in varying degree

the person's actions.
The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,
however, that a significant or motivating purpose of Jane's
travel across state lines was that she would engage in illegal
sexual activity; in other words, the illegal sexual activity
must not have been merely incidental to the trip.
Instruction No. 22.  Count Four.  Transportation of an 
individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual 
activity.  Third element.   
The third element of Count Four which the government 
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knew 
that Jane was less than 17 years old at the time of the acts 
alleged in Count Four of the indictment. 
Instruction No. 23.  Counts Two and Four.  Failure to
accomplish intended activity is immaterial.
Now, with respect to Counts Two and Four, it is not a 
defense that the sexual activity which may have been intended 
by the defendant was not accomplished.  In other words, it's 
not necessary for the government to prove that anyone, in fact, 
engaged in any sexual activity for which any person can be 
charged with a criminal offense with the individual after she 
was enticed for Count Two or transported for Count Four across 
state lines.  It is enough if the defendant has the requisite 
intent at the time of the enticement or transportation.

mind of their own.  Because last week the Court invited them to
sit the extra day and they declined that.  So an inquiry may be
appropriate, but I don't think telling them what they should do
is necessarily the right thing to do.
THE COURT:  Well, I have told them previously that
they are here till at least 5.  I think the question is
whether, in light of the circumstances we find ourselves, we
should encourage longer, if it's available to them.  But you
think about it.  I'll hear from you.  I'm not intending to do
anything just yet.  I presume we will hear from them as to this
evening, but think about the indication of at least some
extension of hours tomorrow if they have not completed the
task.
All right?  Thank you. 
(Recess pending verdict) 
THE COURT:  I have a note.
Under Count Four, if the defendant aided in the
transportation of Jane's return flight, but not the flight to
New Mexico, where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in
sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second
element?
I'm going to let you take a -- if you want to just
take a look at the note.  Counsel, you're welcome to take a
photo of it, if that helps.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Thank you.

Another note from the jury.  This one says:  We would

So we'll take up extending deliberations after we 
resolve the response to this question. 
(Counsel conferred) 
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me get a proposal.
MR. EVERDELL:  Happy to talk, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Counsel, are you ready?

one more moment to confer with our supervisor?

Apologies for the delay. 
THE COURT:  Defense counsel, are you ready?

THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead, Ms. Moe.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, our proposal would be to refer
the jurors to instruction number 21 on page 28 of the Court's
instructions, which pertains to comprehensive instruction with

respect to the second element.  Beyond that, we're not able to
parse the question because we find it confusing; so we think
the safest course is to refer the jurors to the comprehensive
instruction with respect to the second element.
THE COURT:  Mr. Everdell.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I think the answer to this
question is no, and I'll tell you the rationale for this.
As to the jurors' note, they've clearly separated out
in their minds the flight to New Mexico versus the flight back
from New Mexico.  And in their minds, there still is a
question, it would seem, that the flight -- whatever the
purpose of the flight to New Mexico was, whether it was for
illicit sexual activity or not, that is different from the
purpose of the flight back from New Mexico.  And they are
asking can she be found guilty solely on if there's some aiding
and abetting, some helping of that flight from New Mexico,
which presumably the flight home they're saying.
THE COURT:  So the flight from New Mexico to where?
MR. EVERDELL:  Well, there is no record of a flight
from New Mexico.  But what they are saying, I think, in this
note is they are separating out in their minds the flight to
New Mexico versus whatever flight she may have taken from New
Mexico.  And I would say based on the instructions in the
Court's instructions which the government pointed to, there has
to be -- the significant or motivating purpose of the travel

           (212) 805-0300
LCRVMAXT                  
across state lines has to be that Jane engaged in illicit
sexual activity.  There is no significant or motivating purpose
of a return trip where Mr. Epstein wasn't present; it's just a
return trip from New Mexico.  That would not be a significant
or motivating purpose.  She is just presumably going home, but
is not for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity.  
The testimony, if we are to believe it, is that she 
went to New Mexico for some purpose to engage in sexual 
activity, that's if you believe Jane's testimony.  But 
returning from there is not that purpose.  Returning is 
returning, or it's going somewhere else; it's going somewhere 
away from where -- at least in the record, the evidence in the 
record, if there is any -- Epstein was presumably in New 
Mexico.  This is her leaving New Mexico.  So I don't think that 
qualifies as a significant or motivating purpose.  That travel 
across state lines is for some other purpose. 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, I don't believe this note is
that clear about what flight we're talking about.  The note
begins by talking about an unspecified return flight, and then
it turns to talking about a flight to New Mexico.  Then there's
a modifying clause about intent.  It is unclear which of the
two flights we are now modifying.
I think the safest course here is to refer the jury to 
the elements of the crime.  I think guessing at what flight 
they may be talking about is sort of beyond the reach of this 
A-210
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page10 of 221

           (212) 805-0300
LCRVMAXT                  
question because they haven't identified a flight here. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I think they've been fairly
clear.  They say:  If the defendant aided in the transportation
of Jane's return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico.  The
only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is
the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.
And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the
flight to New Mexico.
She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think 
it was a little unclear what may have happened in New Mexico 
based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual 
conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are 
debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico, 
where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.   
Okay.  So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at 
least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for 
the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity.  And they 
are confused that the return flight that happens after that, 
could that be the basis alone for a conviction on Count Four.  
Answer is no, because that return flight is not for the purpose 
of illegal sexual activity. 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, at the very least, the answer to
this can't be no, because a jury could infer intent to engage
in sexual conduct and the return of a flight in aiding and
abetting that.

LCRVMAXT                  
We can't tell which flight we're talking about, which 
leg of a potentially multi-leg trip we're talking about.  And 
so I think here, again, the Court gave a thorough instruction 
about this particular element.  Because we can't tell which set 
of facts they are asking about, I think the proper course here 
is to refer the jury to the particulars with respect to this 
element. 
THE COURT:  It's difficult to know and to have in my
head, based on the articulation of the question, as well as the
testimony, exactly what they are referring to.  I don't know.
So I am inclined to follow the government's suggestion 
here and to say, I can't provide an additional response to your 
question other than to consider carefully the instructions as 
to -- I mean, I could either point them to all of the count or 
specifically to the second element, since that's what they're 
asking about. 
MR. EVERDELL:  If we're going to just refer them to
certain language, I think we refer them to the language in the
last paragraph.
THE COURT:  Page?
MR. EVERDELL:  Page 28, instruction number 21, lines
through 17.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, those particular lines don't
appear to be what the jury is asking about.  I recognize that
the note refers to Count Four and the second element, but the
A-212
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page12 of 221

           (212) 805-0300
LCRVMAXT                  
entire note seems to be about transportation of some kind.  And
so we would propose just referring them to the instruction in
its entirety.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I don't find this note
confusing.  And I think simply saying it's confusing --
THE COURT:  Well, I find it confusing.  For example, I
don't know if this is a question about aiding and abetting.  I
don't know.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I think this is pretty -- I
think this is a question about whether you can hold her
accountable for a return flight, if you believe that she had
something to do with arranging that return flight from New
Mexico; whereas the first flight to New Mexico may have been --
at least there's some testimony to consider about whether that
was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.  It was not
true of the return flight, the flight back, wherever she was
going, home, somewhere else, somewhere away from Mr. Epstein.
I think they are asking, Can we consider if Ms. 
Maxwell had anything to do with that flight, arranging of that 
flight, whether she can be convicted, because it's on the 
return trip from an area where Jane claims she was involved in 
sexual abuse. 
THE COURT:  But it says where/if the intent was to
engage -- for Jane to engage in sexual activity.
MR. EVERDELL:  Right.  They are saying with a flight
A-213
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page13 of 221

           (212) 805-0300
LCRVMAXT                  
to New Mexico, where/if there was an intent for Jane to engage
in sexual activity.  So there is still an open question in
their minds about whether the flight to New Mexico, that
travel, was for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual
activity.
But they are now considering whether the flight out of 
New Mexico, if Ms. Maxwell had any -- did anything to do with 
that flight, with arranging that flight, could we convict her 
on that count alone.  Because there is no, I think, evidence 
that she arranged the flight going to New Mexico; instead, they 
are considering now whether there's any evidence that she may 
have arranged the flight out of New Mexico.  And is that enough 
to provide a conviction on Count Two?  And I think the answer 
to that is pretty clearly no -- I'm sorry, Count Four I should 
have said, not Count Two.  Because there's no evidence of that.   
And there is also -- there is no -- in the 
instructions themselves, that would not be a significant or 
motivating purpose for that travel across state lines.  That 
would simply be for her to return home.  That's not travel for 
the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, I think this colloquy
illustrates how confusing the note is.  We are now guessing at
what hypothetical facts the jury is talking about; and then
guessing hypothetically what their legal question is on top of
that.  And I think we're compounding guesswork, what this
A-214
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page14 of 221

           (212) 805-0300
LCRVMAXT                  
question is about.  And so the question is about the element;
the charge is about that particular element.  I think more
guesswork here makes this more confusing and not less
confusing.  I think, as the Court pointed out, some aspects of
this note are about aiding and abetting.  And so even referring
the jury just to instruction number 21 leaves out that aspect
of the jury's deliberations and their determination on this
particular issue.  And so we think the safest course is to
provide the jury with applicable law in this area, and they can
find the facts as they see fit and as they apply to these
particular instructions.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I don't think this is a
question about aid and abetting, broadly speaking.  I think
they are talking about the flights to and from New Mexico.  I
think that much is pretty clear from the note.  And whether or
not Ms. Maxwell had anything to do with arranging that
travel --
THE COURT:  But your legal contention is she can't be
found guilty of this count unless the jury concludes that she
aided in the transportation to New Mexico.
That's not legally accurate, is it? 
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, the instruction itself says
it has to be a significant or motivating purpose for the travel
across state lines.
THE COURT:  Right.

LCRVMAXT                  
MR. EVERDELL:  Right?  
The travel back to a place where she is presumably not 
engaging in illicit sexual activity, that is not a significant 
or motivating purpose for that travel. 
THE COURT:  You didn't answer my question.
MR. EVERDELL:  Maybe I'm confused by the question,
your Honor.
THE COURT:  To be found guilty on this count, must the
jury conclude that she aided in the transportation of Jane's
flight to New Mexico?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, may I interject myself
into this conversation?
THE COURT:  If you answer the question, I would value
it.
MS. MENNINGER:  I will.
It has to be a place for which the travel was a 
significant or motivating purpose for illegal sexual activity.   
In this hypothetical that they've given in this 
question, they have a comma in two places.  The first place 
they have a comma is after the return flight, comma, but not 
the flight to New Mexico, where the intent was for Jane to 
engage in sexual activity, comma.  So they have excluded out 
where they're hypothetically claiming that the flight to New 
Mexico was the place for which the intent was for Jane to 
engage in sexual activity.

LCRVMAXT                  
THE COURT:  Wow.
MS. MENNINGER:  And they are asking, Can we find her
responsible for the return flight, but not that flight to New
Mexico, where the intent was to engage in sexual activity.
That's why I think they have written it with the commas as they
are.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. MENNINGER:  So they have to be directed --
THE COURT:  Let me try again.  Can I get a yes or a no
to my question?  Is it your legal position that the jury must
conclude, in order to convict on this count, that the defendant
had to aid in the transportation of the flight to New Mexico?
MS. MENNINGER:  I don't believe that -- no, no, it is
not my contention.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MS. MENNINGER:  And the reason is the indictment does
not specify New Mexico.  It could be a flight to New York, for
example.  It could be a flight to New Mexico.  It could be any
place, the purpose for which was to engage in illegal sexual
activity.  So it doesn't have to be to New Mexico.
THE COURT:  I agree with that.
This is why it's difficult to parse the question 
without assuming a variety of meanings, and I'm trying to track 
your comma argument. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Had they placed the comma after New
A-217

           (212) 805-0300
LCRVMAXT                  
Mexico rather than the place where they did put the comma, then
that would have told us, can't she be responsible for aiding in
the transportation of the return flight, comma, but not the
flight to New Mexico, comma.  That would then put the where/if
the intent was --
THE COURT:  That would be an entirely different
meaning to the question.
MS. MENNINGER:  I think so.
THE COURT:  No, I agree.  What I don't know is I don't
know what they meant and I don't know how much weight to put on
that comma placement; because, as you've noted, that precise
sentence without that comma has an entirely different meaning.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
And I think at the point at which we're parsing jury 
notes like statutes this finely, I think it illustrates the 
point that this note is confusing; that we're not sure what the 
jury is asking about either factually or legally.   
The question is about the second element; and so we 
think the proper course is to refer the jury to those 
particular instructions.  And the jury is free to send a 
clarifying note, if they wish to do so.  But I think when we 
are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it's 
unclear which clauses are modifying which clauses, or which 
flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too 
confusing to give simple answers here.

LCRVMAXT                  
THE COURT:  I can't answer this ambiguous question no.
I don't know that the answer is no, even with the ambiguity;
because I don't know if what they have in mind is an aiding and
abetting question, which we haven't discussed yet.
MS. MENNINGER:  They never used the word "abet."
THE COURT:  That's true.  I won't assume that's the
question for purposes of the answer, but I also don't assume
the meaning that you've put on it for purposes of the answer.
So the only solution here is to say, I direct you to consider
the full instruction on Element 2 of Count Four on page 28.
MS. MENNINGER:  Our request would be to emphasize the
portion of that that talks about the purpose of the travel.
Because they have highlighted the purpose of the travel in
their question.  And the way I read it is certainly that that's
their question.  If they don't have evidence that the intent on
the return flight was for purposes of sexual activity, then I
do think the answer, as Mr. Everdell said is, no, they can't
convict.
MS. STERNHEIM:  May I have a moment?

MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I'm sorry to raise another

which is the substantive transportation count, which, as we 
know, has to deal with the violation of New York law.  And they 
are talking about flights to New Mexico; and can she be found 
guilty on the second element of Count Four regarding these 
flights to New Mexico.   
So I think we may have to respond to the jury on that 
score as well, which is the fact that they have to be 
considering New York events for Count Four, rather than -- or 
violations of New York law, which wouldn't occur in New Mexico 
for there to be a conviction on Count Four. 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, I think that's exactly why we
proposed directing the jurors to the entirety of the
instruction, which says just that.  The second paragraph of
that same instruction reminds the jury, as the instruction does
throughout, that we're talking about New York Penal Law,
Section 130.55.  And so I think our proposal remains the same
that they be referred to the entirety of the instruction, which
includes that language, among other aspects of this particular
element.
THE COURT:  Yes.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Judge, may I be heard for a moment?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. STERNHEIM:  I think the fact that the jury has
mentioned New Mexico regarding a count that pertains to New
York is not just cleared up by referring them to the
A-220

instruction.  Clearly they are making an error concerning which
state begins with "New."  And I suggest that if the Court
wishes to refer them to the charge, the Court also clears up
the fact that Count Four requires a violation of New York law,
not New Mexico law.
THE COURT:  That's certainly why we should refer them
to the whole charge.  That's what lines 7 through 10 make
clear.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The only illegal sexual activity identified in the 
entirety of the jury charge is a statute in New York.  There 
cannot be any risk of confusion on that score.  This particular 
charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as 
well.  The jury has not been charged about any laws in New 
Mexico; so there can't be any risk of confusion for exactly 
that reason. 
MR. EVERDELL:  I just don't understand the confidence
about how there can be no possible confusion --
THE COURT:  This conversation is stopping.  
My decision is to refer them back to this charge, 
because it is a proper instruction on the second element to 
Count Four.  I do not know what this question means.  It's too 
difficult to parse factually and legally what they're asking.  
So the only option in those circumstances is to direct them 
back to the count.

So I'll take any requests beyond simply saying, I 
received your note.  I refer you to instruction number 21 on 
page 28.  Please consider carefully the full instruction. 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Everdell?
MR. EVERDELL:  That's fine, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll do that.  And then -- well,
let me write it, and then we'll send it back, and then we'll
discuss -- because we have to bring them in to dismiss them.
So I received your note.  I refer you to instruction
number 21 on page 28.  Please consider the entirety of the
instruction.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. EVERDELL:  Without waiving our prior objection.
THE COURT:  Understood.
All right.  While Ms. Williams is handing that to the
CSO, for extending deliberation times going forward.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  
We've considered the matter.  And the government's 
view is that is within the Court's discretion certainly to set 
a schedule for jury deliberations.  Given the circumstances, we 
agree that it's prudent to advise the jury that, barring any 
scheduling complications, they should expect an extended day 
tomorrow.

New York, NY 10007 
Re:  United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We respectfully submit this letter to request that the Court give the jury additional 
instructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the 
law applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court 
Exhibit #15). 
Court Exhibit #15 reads, in relevant part, as follows: 
Under Count Four (4), [i]f the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return 
flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage 
in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element? 
Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida 
to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would engage in one 
or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55.”  S2 
Ind. ¶ 21 (emphasis added).   
In response to the note, the Court referred the jury to Instruction No. 21 of the jury charge.  
The defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.

2068538.1 
Constructive Amendment / Variance 
First, without further instruction, the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell based on a 
constructive amendment and/or prejudicial variance from the S2 Indictment.  The Court has 
recently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance.  “To prevail on a constructive 
amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect 
altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of 
the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been 
convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. 15-
cr-769 (AJN), 2017 WL 4685111, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2017) (cleaned up).  “Because the 
doctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a 
constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’ of the defendant’s constitutional rights—
i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific showing of prejudice.”  Id. (quoting 
United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 417 (2d Cir. 2012). 
Although the Second Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility” in how the 
government proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of 
criminality to be proven at trial.”  Id. (cleaned up).  “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general 
terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms 
may be read to specify a narrower set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at 
trial could lead to a constructive amendment.”  Id. (quoting United States v. Wozniak, 126 F.3d 
105, 109-10 (2d Cir. 1997)).

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
December 27, 2021 
Page 3 
2068538.1 
In contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of 
the indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from 
those alleged in the indictment.”  Id. at 20 (cleaned up). 
Court Exhibit #15 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive 
transportation offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New 
Mexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there.  That is not what the 
indictment alleges.  Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported 
from Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would 
engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 
130.55.”  S2 Ind. ¶ 21 (emphasis added).  As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on 
evidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New 
York, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section 130.55 of the New York Penal Law.  
The government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be 
convicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to 
violate New York law.  That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.  
Indeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #15, the government stressed this point: 
The only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a 
statute in New York.  There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This 
particular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The 
jury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any 
risk of confusion for exactly that reason. 
Tr. 3140:10-16 (emphasis added).

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

2068538.1 
Despite the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #15 indicates that the jury is 
considering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and 
alleged sexual abuse that purportedly took place in New Mexico.  Should the jury convict on this 
basis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count 
Four.  Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly 
engaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in 
Count Four.  See Wozniak, 126 F.3d at 109-111 (finding constructive amendment where 
indictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at 
trial focused on marijuana).  A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any 
sexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at 
trial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment.  Gross, 2017 WL 
4685111, at *20.  If the Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on 
Count Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms. 
Maxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive 
amendment.  Id.  A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a showing 
of prejudice. United States v. Frank, 156 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. 1998). 
At the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged 
sexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2 
Indictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law.  The 
Court should instruct the jury as requested below to prevent such a variance from occurring.  Ms. 
Maxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by

a curative instruction.  Moreover, because the same issues arise with respect to the substantive 
enticement offense charged in Count Two, the Court must give the same instruction as to Count 
Two as well.1 
Supplemental Jury Instruction 
Second, we believe that the Court’s response to the jury note was substantively incorrect 
and prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. “A jury’s interruption of its deliberations ‘to seek further 
explanation of the law’ is a ‘critical moment in a criminal trial’; and [the Second Circuit] therefore 
ascribe[s] ‘crucial importance’ to a ‘completely accurate statement by the judge’ at that moment.” 
United States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d 168, 172 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Lefkowitz, 
284 F.2d 310, 314 (2d Cir. 1960)).  “Instructions are erroneous if they mislead the jury as to the 
correct legal standard or do not adequately inform the jury of the law.”  Hudson v. New York City, 
271 F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir. 2001).  Reversal is “required where, based on a review of the record as a 
whole, the error was prejudicial or the charge was highly confusing.”  Kopstein, 759 F.3d at 172; 
see also id. (“A charge that appears likely to have left the jury ‘highly confused’ may, on that 
ground alone, be reversed.” (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. One 25,900 Square Foot More 
or Less Parcel of Land, 766 F.2d 685, 688 (2d Cir. 1985) (“A charge that appears likely to have 
left the jury ‘highly confused’ may, on that ground alone, be reversed.”))). “Even if an initial 
The defense notes that the object of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three is a violation of the same 
New York statute.  While we do not contest that alleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of 
those conspiracies, the jury cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on those counts without finding that she acted with the intent 
that someone under the age of 17 would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New 
York law.

instruction is not itself erroneous or highly confusing, a supplemental instruction prompted by a 
jury question may be so muddled as to warrant vacatur.”  Id. at 172.  
The jury note indicates that the jury is confused about the second element of Count Four, 
and by extension, the third element of Count Two.  Both counts require an intent to violate New 
York law and cannot be based on any conduct that allegedly occurred in New Mexico (or any 
other state besides New York).  The court’s answer to the jury’s question permits the jury to 
convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on alleged conduct occurring in New Mexico—aiding 
in a return flight from New Mexico.  Not only is that conduct not charged in the indictment (see 
discussion above), it also is not illegal under New York law.  Under New York law, an intent to 
engage in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law, 
as charged in Counts Two and Four.  See People v. Carvajal, 6 N.Y.3d 305, 312 (2005) (“CPL 
20.20[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise criminal jurisdiction, 
some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).  If the 
defendant disputes the evidence of the State’s prosecutorial authority at trial, “the trial court 
should charge the jury that jurisdiction must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”  People v. 
McLaughlin, 80 N.Y.2d 466, 472 (N.Y. 1992).

Proposed Jury Instruction 
For the reasons set forth above, we request that the Court give the jury the following 
additional instruction tomorrow: 
As to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the Government 
has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with the intent that 
Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York in violation of 
New York Penal Law 130.55.   
As to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the 
Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported 
Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of 
New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.   
An intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York 
cannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.

(Jury not present)
THE COURT:  I received -- I think it was filed in the
wee hours, I didn't receive it until this morning, the
defense's followup letter taking a slightly different approach
to the jury's last note than what was argued in court.  
I haven't heard from the government.
MS. MOE:  I just noticed that the door to the jury
room is open.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  To be clear, the jury is not
there.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  I meant the door to the
area that leads to the jury room.  Just wanted to be cautious.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Appreciate that.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.  With respect to the
defendant's letter, this is essentially the same argument that
the defense advanced yesterday, which the Court carefully
considered and rejected.  Nothing has changed between then and
now.
In particular, the defense's letter identifies no
error in the instruction the Court referred the jury to nor
could they.  It was a correct legal instruction when the Court
instructed the jury last week, it was a correct legal
instruction when the Court referred the jury to it yesterday
afternoon, and that it remains true.  It was a thorough and
carefully considered instruction on the legal elements and
A-231

            (212) 805-0300
LCSCMAXT                  
there can be no error in referring the jury to a correct legal
instruction.  And so no relief is appropriate here.
At bottom, your Honor, the jury asked a question and
nothing more.  There is no reason to speculate about what the
jury might be concluding.  The jury has been accurately
instructed on the law and that's all that's required here.
Going beyond that to speculate about the jury's deliberations
and compound speculation upon speculation to send back
confusing legal instructions would compound the problem here.
The simple course is exactly the course the Court took
yesterday, which is to refer the jury to a thorough and
complete and accurate legal instruction.  There can't be any
dispute that the instructions that the Court has given are
accurate, and that's all that's required here.
THE COURT:  I suppose an additional point, just
looking at the -- I mean, the defense's new proposed
instruction talks about Count Two, which wasn't asked about.
Also, it has -- so it has three paragraphs.  The first one is
about Count Two, which wasn't asked about.  There is a second
paragraph.  And then the third paragraph I think is just wrong,
an intent that Jane engaged in sexual activity in any state
other than New York cannot form the basis of these elements.
That would suggest it may have no relevance.  This is the same
discussion we've had a couple of times, Mr. Everdell.  Sexual
activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of 17

            (212) 805-0300
LCSCMAXT                  
can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage
in sexual activity under the age of 17, I think.  I think this
is the same basic discussion that we've had.  So, in addition
to my reasoning yesterday, I think the proposal made by the
defense is wrong.
I continue to not know how to parse the jury's
question exactly, other than to know that they are asking about
Count Four, the defense's original suggestion to just point to
the motivating factor I rejected language or to say no.  To say
no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand
the question well enough to be able to say no.
Pointing to just the motivating factor language I
think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remind
them of the whole instruction, including that it's a violation
of New York penal law that's charged and is the illegal sexual
activity that they're considering.
So, for those reasons, I am in the same place.
I did want to make a little bit of an additional
record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the
instructions that I gave yesterday regarding that slightly
extended schedule.
I asked the jury to make themselves available to
deliberate until at least 6:00 today, which is a one-hour
extension of what's largely been our schedule.  Although, it
was until 6 o'clock, I think, on the first night of

deliberations.
I made clear that they can let me know through my
deputy if this presents a hardship for anyone.  No one has so
indicated.  I also made clear that they can take all the time
they need.
I extended the deliberations by an hour each day
because we are seeing an astronomical spike in the number
COVID-positive cases in New York City over the last one to two
weeks duce to the omicron variant.  We are, very simply, at a
different place regarding the pandemic than we were only one
week ago, and we now face a high and escalating risk that
jurors and/or trial participants may need to quarantine, thus
disrupting trial and putting at risk our ability to complete
this trial.  Accordingly, extending deliberations by an hour
gives the jury more time each day to continue to engage in its
thoughtful deliberations.
We will take up later in the day how I will approach
the remainder of the week and going forward.  I think the same
reasoning likely will lead me to talk to the jury at the end of
the day about continuing deliberations until a verdict is
reached.
I'll hear you on that now or later, as you like.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I don't need to be heard on
that issue now.
If I could, I understand the Court has overruled the

request of the letter, but if I could make a brief record on
that, it will not take very long.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And so there is the record that you
made yesterday at the time the question came.  There is the
record that you put in the letter this morning that came in
late -- early this morning that I reviewed this morning that we
just discussed.  So, to the extent you're seeking a third bite
at the apple, go ahead.
MR. EVERDELL:  I'm simply looking to fill out the
record.  I understand it's been rejected by the Court.
I think from the defense point of view, I think two
things are very clear from this note.  One is that the jury is
considering whether or not they can convict Ms. Maxwell on the
substantive offense in Count Four based solely on events that
took place in New Mexico and traveled to and from New Mexico.
THE COURT:  There are a number of assumptions in that
that don't necessarily derive from the meaning of that letter,
but I understand that is your position.
MR. EVERDELL:  Understood, your Honor.  
And I think the second point is that they are looking
at the instructions that they have been given thus far because
they reference the second element of Count Four.  So they're
looking at that instruction and they are unclear, they are
confused by those instructions.  They are not sure whether or
not -- those instructions don't inform them that, in fact,

conduct that occurs solely in New Mexico, travels to and from
New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a
violation of New York law --
THE COURT:  Again, using your language, cannot form a
basis, would suggest it is irrelevant.  I'll say that is wrong
as a legal matter, number 1.  Number 2, you didn't seek to
exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction
with respect to that testimony, and I think that was quite ripe
for all of the reasons we've articulated.
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes.  Although, I would point out we
did, in the charging conference, request the inclusion of
travel from Florida to New York to make clear that that was the
required facts to be proven for those counts.
In any event, I think this is a time that calls for a
supplemental instruction.  I understand the Court has
rejected --
THE COURT:  I'm not going to give them an incorrect
supplemental instruction.  
MR. EVERDELL:  If the Court thinks the instruction
that was proposed is incorrect, we can certainly work to draft
a correct one.  I think the jury is saying that they may
convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on conduct that solely
relates to New Mexico.  I am not saying it is irrelevant.  What
I am saying is if all they had — which is what I think the note
is saying — is travel to and from New Mexico and alleged sexual

activity that occurred in New Mexico, that wouldn't be a
sufficient basis to convict on Count Four or Count Two because
it requires an intent to violate New York law, and you can't
violate this section of New York law in New Mexico.
So if that's all they're considered on a basis to
convict on Count Four and Count Two, then that would be
insufficient and improper, and that's why I think a
supplemental instruction that clarifies that point is warranted
in this case, but I understand the Court has rejected that.
And that's all.
THE COURT:  I think the instruction is correct that I
referred them to.  The reading of the note that you've
suggested, I have no idea if that's what the jury is asking or
many other plausible readings, and what you've proposed, as you
just indicated, would be incorrect.  So, I think that's why
precisely we sent them back to the charge.
Anything else?
MR. EVERDELL:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  As I said, we'll see where we are at the
end of the day, but in light of the variant, my concern about
interruption of trial, given the increasing daily risk of
exposure to either a juror or trial participant requiring
quarantine, it is time to think to have the jurors make plans
to continue deliberating until a verdict is reached.
I will wait until we hear from the jury, otherwise

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On January 19, 2022, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 on the basis that Juror 50 “falsely answered a material question 
during voir dire and . . . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been subject to a 
challenge for cause.”  Maxwell Br., Jan. 19, 2022, at 48.  The Defendant contends that the 
current paper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing.  
In the alternative, she requests that a hearing be conducted.  Id.  She also argues that if a hearing 
is ordered, a broader hearing is required based on a news article that suggests a second juror was 
allegedly a victim of sexual abuse.  Id. at 48–49.  
In an Opinion & Order filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s 
motion for a new trial on the current record.  As explained in the temporarily sealed Opinion & 
Order, Defendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 
regarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from 
considering under Federal Rule of Evidence 606.  With regard to Juror 50’s statements that do 
not pertain to jury deliberations, in order to resolve the motion on this record, the Court would 
have to accept unsworn statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual 
determinations that are not available on the current record.

Accordingly, for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order, a hearing is 
necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion.  Because of the important interest in the finality of 
judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high.  The Court concludes, and 
the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary 
hearing is met as to whether Juror 50 failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection 
process to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse.  Following trial, Juror 50 made several 
direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do not 
pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury 
selection.  Juror 50’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible 
evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury 
selection—has occurred.  United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2018).  To be clear, 
the potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on 
the jury.  Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury 
selection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be 
explored. 
In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to 
the conduct of any other juror.  The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect 
to the other jurors.  The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and 
pre-hearing discovery.   
The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question 
Juror 50 under oath.  The Court further ORDERS that Juror 50’s questionnaire be unsealed, for 
the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.  The Court will email counsel for Juror 50 a copy 
of his questionnaire and a copy of this Order.  As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the

A-240
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page40 of 221

Court will conduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the 
Defendant and the Government.  The parties may submit by email proposed questions in 
accordance with the Opinion & Order on or before March 1, 2022.    
The hearing will take place on March 8, 2022, at 10:00 a.m.  The Court ORDERS Juror 
to appear in Courtroom 906 of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre 
Street, New York, New York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to 
the Court’s questions.  The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on 
public access as soon as it is available.  
The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion & Order to the parties.  By noon on 
February 25, 2022, the parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either seeks limited 
redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming any requests to this Court’s prior order, Dkt. No. 
596, and justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second 
Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  
SO ORDERED. 
Dated: February 24, 2022 
New York, New York

A. 
family, yeah . 
Q. 
But now you sa.y yes because it would have been a 
stepbrother. 
Explain. 
A. 
Becau~e by law, by marriage, that person was my 
stepbrother. 
So when you read the question that way and it 
says has a friend or family rr,ember ever been accused, then the 
correct answer woul d have been yes, a friend or fa~ily member .

Okay . 
And so the 8arr.e response then for 4BA is whe t you

Yes , your Honor.

In no case. 
It would not affect me. 
Q. 
[n responain; a :noment ago you saI d you nc· .. cr thought you

Why is that? 
A. 
Only because the s heer volume ot peopl e that were ther e. 
It was i~sane , the ~~ount of people. 
So I juse never 
t hought - - number one, 
I didn 't know what it was when I went 
into it, and then when t hey played the video of you, 
I just 
thought t hat the likelihood ot being chosen, surely they wil l 
be interviewing thousands of people. 
And t hey ultimatel y 
choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I 
would be cne of those twelve.

MR. EVERDELL: What rlas -- we gave a number of those

You talked publlcly about the fact

Ooes lt deal nlth your experiences as vlctlm of sexual abuse?

Is thls an lssue that you are ntlll

TIiE COURT: I dld revlei, those questlons plopo3ed and
I con8ldeled then. Ihe defenae did not propose any co(palable

Any other folloo-up requeata?
MR. EVERDELL: Your llonor, I think r.e need to talk

thls ,as repeated, happened multlple tldes, Ihls happened rrlth

MR. EVERDELL : 
Your Honer, I think we need to talk

He said that he recogn!2ed by talking to

MR. EVERDELL:

thi nk at the same time he's saying I didn't think this would be

I don't know hm,' you 
square those responses . 
To me -- and I know this was the 
sub ject of ar gument that you don't \o,'ant to hear at this point ,

he's talking out of both sides of his mcuth: 
I didn 't think ]

It makes 
no sense to me . 
I ' m curious to hear more about ""hat I percei ve 
as blatant conflict in answers about a discussion with a 
jcurnalist about the consequences of going forward.

You want me to as~ about what he discussed

If

THE COURT : 
I 
t h i~k what r will d o is go back and 4~k
: 
Did you under"tand at the time you talked to the press in t he 
way that you did, did yeu understand that it would be publicly 
known that you were a victim of sexual abuse? We'll see what 
he says. 
old you think about the con::;equences a! talking to the 
press about that? 
Did you talk to t he press, t he press

It ' s difficult fo= me t o ace what it 'a going at , but I 
will seek clarification on his answers, as I did multiple 
times, on t he reconciling and understanding his t hinking about 
coming out publicly as a victim of sexual atuse. 
He bas

which also there's a tempora l 
issue here, he didn't think about it until ho talked to the

SCHEDULE 
Potential jurors will be called back for further questioning and jury selection from 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021, through Friday, November 19, 2021. Your availability 
during that week will be required. 
The trial will commence on Monday, November 29, 2021. The trial is expected to last 
about six weeks. Generally, trial will be held five days per week, Monday through Friday, 
from 9:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. Trial will not be held on Friday, December 24, 2021 
(Christmas Eve Day) and Friday, December 31, 2021 (New Year's Eve). 
If you are selected as a juror, you will be required to be present for the taking of testimony and 
evidence for as long as the trial lasts. There are no plans to sequester the jury, which means 
you will go home every day after court. 
All jury service involves some degree of hardship. Our court and justice system depends on 
citizens doing their civic duty to serve as jurors, which involves temporarily putting aside their 
regularbusrnesdorjury serViCe. The Court views service on a jury to be one ofthe highest 
duties a citizen owes to the United States. Mere inconvenience or the usual fInancial hardship 
of jury service will not be suffIcient to excuse a prospective juror. 
You must show 
extraordinary personal or fmancial hardship to be excused from service.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation: 
Central to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury 
of one’s peers.  Citizens give their time and attention to this critical role in the administration of 
justice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution.  Judicial officers are charged with the 
implementation of this constitutional right.  In all cases, whether of high profile or low, trial 
courts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated 
on the jury.  And once seated, the jury must be permitted to deliberate fully and frankly in an 
effort to reach a unanimous verdict.  Trials entail significant investments of public and private 
resources.  McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (1984).  For all of 
these reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.   
Before the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury 
selection.  Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment 
right to an impartial jury.  Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon 
post-trial hearing.  Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible 
evidence that Juror 50 failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question 
on a written questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse.  At the hearing, the Court

questioned the juror under oath and under the penalty of perjury.  The Court inquired about 
whether his answers were false, his explanation for giving those answers, and how he would 
have responded to follow-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury 
selection.  This inquiry was limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 606, which prohibits a juror 
from testifying about the content of deliberations or his mental processes in evaluating the 
evidence at trial.  The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of 
the integrity of the jury trial system.  The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and 
Second Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of 
potential misconduct by the juror.   
Based on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 50 failed to 
answer honestly a material question during jury selection, and whether, if he had provided a 
correct response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.  
Controlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to 
exercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed 
his prior sexual abuse.  It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to 
actual, implied, or inferred bias.  See McDonough Power Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555–56.  The 
limits on the nature of the post-trial inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of 
judgments.   
The Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements 
of the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood.  The Court finds Juror 50 
testified credibly at the hearing.  There are many reasons for that finding.   He appeared to testify 
frankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment 
and regret.  His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 2 of 40
A-319
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page119 of 221

His tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.  The Court thus 
credits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way 
too fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions.  Assuming mistakenly that he 
would not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had 
been summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire.  This led to inaccurate answers.  Juror 50’s 
lack of attention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is 
regrettable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate. 
The Court further finds that Juror 50 was not biased and would not have been stricken for 
cause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately.  At the hearing, the 
Court asked Juror 50 the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had 
indicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire.  These questions are typical of 
how trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s 
responses—whether the juror should be struck for cause.  This is so because the key question is 
not simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored 
at trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially. 
This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member 
murdered was not struck for cause.  So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and 
individuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases.  And 
survivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape.  In this case, 
Juror 50’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial 
juror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve 
fairly and impartially.  Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 50 for cause if he had 
provided accurate responses to the questionnaire.

The Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.  
I. 
BACKGROUND 
A. Jury Selection Process  
The jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of 
prospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of 
New York’s COVID-19 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors, 
court staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in 
three stages: a written pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the 
exercise of peremptory strikes.  The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input 
from the parties.  See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 21, 2021 Tr., Dkt. No. 459.  The questionnaire 
was designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s 
length and schedule, a juror’s personal knowledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s 
awareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a 
result of the nature of the charges.”  Oct. 21, 2021 Tr. at 5.  In-person voir dire would then focus 
on appropriate follow-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more 
appropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed 
peremptory challenges.  Id. at 7.  
When prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned 
for voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court.  The Court prepared those 
instructions with the parties’ input.  Dkt. Nos. 366, 404, 427.  These instructions briefly 
explained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same 
language that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss 
the case or consume any media about the case.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 4 of 40
A-321
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page121 of 221

The final questionnaire contained 51 questions, although multiple questions required 
follow-up responses for certain answers.  Dkt. No. 462.  Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a 
prospective juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, harassment, and assault.  
Question 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a 
victim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the following order: “Yes (self),” “Yes 
(friend or family member),” and “No.”  Id. at 13.  Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there 
anything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in 
this case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.”  Finally, Question 25b asked: “If 
yes to 25a, please explain.”  Several lines were then provided for the prospective juror to explain 
their answer.  Id.  
Question 48 asked:  
Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault?  (This includes actual or attempted sexual assault or other 
unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or 
family member). 
Id. at 24.  Like Question 25, there were three answer options in the following order: “Yes (self),” 
“Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.”  Question 48a next asked: “If yes, without listing 
names, please explain.”  Space was provided to write an answer.  Question 48b asked: “If your 
answer to 48 was yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and 
impartially as a juror in this case?”  There were two answer choices: “Yes” and “No.”  Finally, 
Question 48c asked: “If yes to 48b, please explain.”  Like Question 48a, several lines of space 
were provided to answer the question.  Id.   
Finally, Question 49 asked:  
Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault?  (This includes both formal accusations in a court of law or 
informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual assault or 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 5 of 40

other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, 
teacher, or family member.).  
Id. at 25.  Like Questions 25 and 48, there were three answer options in the following order: 
“Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.”  The follow-up questions to Question 
followed the same structure as the follow-up questions to Question 48.  Question 49a asked: 
“If yes, without listing names, please explain.”  Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was 
yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in 
this case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.”  Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b, 
please explain.”  Id.  The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both 
sides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.  
See Dkt. No. 367 at 21, 24.  The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual 
harassment.  See id. at 22.  Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a 
compromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire. 
During five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and 12, 2021, 694 
prospective jurors completed the questionnaire.  See Nov. 15, 2021 Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.  
Counsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submitted four lists to the Court: (1) 
prospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that 
both sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant 
but not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the 
Government but not the Defendant believed should be excused.  Id. at 2–3.  Because the parties 
agreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not 
resolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.  
Id. at 2–5.

As a result of this process, 231 prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person 
questioning for voir dire.  Id. at 4.  At this second stage of selection, the Court questioned 
prospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process 
in light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to 
ensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.”  Id. at 8.  If a prospective juror 
was not struck for cause, the Court instructed the now-qualified juror to return on the morning of 
November 29, 2021, for the parties’ exercise of peremptory strikes.   
B. Juror 50’s jury selection process  
Juror 50 completed the questionnaire on the morning of November 4, 2021—the first 
questionnaire session.  Mar. 8, 2022 Hearing Tr. at 7.  In his questionnaire, Juror 50 checked 
“No” for Question 25.  Hearing Exhibit 1 at 13, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “Questionnaire”).  He 
left Questions 25a and 25b blank.  For Question 48, he checked the box “No.”  Id. at 24.  He left 
Questions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank.  Finally, Juror 50 checked “No” for Question 49.  Id. at 25.  
He left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.  
Juror 50 was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.  
He returned for in-person questioning on November 16, 2021.  Consistent with other prospective 
jurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 50 any 
follow-up questions on these issues.  However, the Court did ask Juror 50 about his background, 
whether he would follow the Court’s instructions, and his prior knowledge of the Defendant and 
Jeffrey Epstein, among other questions.  Juror 50 explained that he had seen a news article on 
CNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of 
evidence, here presented in court.”  Nov. 16, 2021 Voir Dire Tr. at 130; see also id. at 131 
(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knowledge aside).  In closing, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 7 of 40
A-324
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page124 of 221

the Court asked if Juror 50 had any doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides.  Juror 50 
replied, “No” and affirmed that he did not have “any reason to think that [he] can’t be fair and 
impartial here.”  Id. at 134.  
On November 29, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes.  The Defendant used all 
of her strikes.  See Nov. 29, 2021 Trial Tr. at 731–32.  Juror 50 was one of fifty-eight qualified 
prospective jurors, and he was ultimately one of the twelve deliberating jurors.  Id. at 733.   
C. Juror 50’s post-verdict interviews and party response  
Following the thirteen-day trial, the jury began deliberations on December 20, 2021.  The 
jury returned a unanimous verdict on December 29, 2021, finding the Defendant guilty of five of 
the six counts.  Dkt. No. 593 at 29–30.   
A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2022, the Government 
informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to press outlets 
about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the matter.  Dkt. No. 568.  The letter 
noted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror “described being a 
victim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the jury questionnaire and did not 
recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse.  Id. at 1.  The Government 
indicated that it believed the juror to be Juror 50, and a review of his questionnaire showed that 
he had provided a negative response to a question that asked whether a prospective juror had 
been a victim of sexual abuse.  Id. at 2 n.2; see also Feb. 25, 2022 Op. & Order, at 3 & n.1, Dkt. 
No. 620.  A letter from the Defendant followed shortly thereafter also informing the Court about 
the juror’s interviews.  Dkt. No. 569.  The Defendant filed a second letter that same day 
opposing the Government’s request for a hearing “because based on undisputed, publicly

available information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary 
hearing.”  Dkt. No. 570.1  
On January 19, 2022, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, on the basis of Juror 50’s statements.  Dkt. Nos. 613, 642.  In an 
Opinion & Order dated February 25, 2022, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new 
trial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.  
The Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and 
incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a 
false statement during jury selection.  The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 
606, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what 
occurred during jury deliberations.  Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1).  Accordingly, the evidentiary 
hearing was limited to “whether Juror 50 provided false answers on the questionnaire, the 
explanation for those answers, and how Juror 50 would have responded to follow-up questions if 
accurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process.  Feb. 25, 2022 Op. & 
Order, at 7. 
D. Evidentiary Hearing 
The hearing took place on March 8, 2022.  Juror 50 appeared with retained counsel and 
testified pursuant to a grant of immunity.  Hearing Tr. at 3–5.  Juror 50 confirmed he understood 
that if he provided false answers he could be prosecuted for perjury.  Id. at 5.  The Court 
conducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submitted proposed questions in 
advance for the Court’s consideration.  Dkt. Nos. 635, 636.  The Court’s inquiry went beyond the 
As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2022, the Jury Department of the Southern District of 
New York received a call from Juror 50 asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media 
outlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an attorney, and asking if he 
could receive a copy of his completed questionnaire.  February 25, 2022 Op. & Order, at 3 n.2.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 9 of 40
A-326
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page126 of 221

limited approach proposed by the Government.  The Court also rejected many of the Defendant’s 
proposed lines of questions.  The parties were also permitted to propose follow-up questions at 
the hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 50’s responses.  The Court accepted 
some of these proposals and rejected others. 
Juror 50 testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate.  He 
explained that when he was nine and ten years old, he was abused on multiple occasions by a 
stepbrother, who he no longer considered part of the family, and one of the stepbrother’s friends.  
Hearing Tr. at 8.  He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school.  His mother 
called the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought.  Id. at 8–9.  Although he first 
testified that “no” was correct for Question 49 because he did not consider the stepbrother part of 
his family, upon further questioning from the Court, he acknowledged that the correct answer 
would have been “yes.”  Id. at 11–13.  He similarly acknowledged that “yes (self)” would have 
been correct to Question 25; although at the time of the questionnaire, he understood the question 
to be asking about being “robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that.”  Id. at 9–10.   
Juror 50 testified that these incorrect answers were an inadvertent mistake and that he had 
not intentionally failed to disclose his personal history of sexual abuse.  Id. at 14–16, 22–23.  He 
explained that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “completely skimmed way 
too fast,” leading him to misunderstand the questions.  Id. at 14–15.  It took several hours to start 
the questionnaire after a long security line and technical issues with the Court’s instructional 
video.  His mind was preoccupied with a recent romantic breakup and the commotion at the 
nearby check-out table.  He saw other prospective jurors completing their questionnaires and 
rushed to finish.  He explained that he was unconcerned with diligently completing the 
questionnaire; he assumed due to the sheer “volume” of prospective jurors being screened that it 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 10 of 40
A-327
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page127 of 221

was impossible he would be selected as a final juror.  Id. at 11–13, 18.  He testified that his 
personal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not 
crossed his mind as he filled out the questionnaire.   
The Court asked follow-up questions consistent with those asked of prospective jurors 
during voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires, 
including those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial.  Further, the 
Court asked Juror 50 about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony.  The Court did not 
permit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise 
irrelevant or redundant.  Ultimately, Juror 50 testified that his experience would not affect his 
ability to be a fair and impartial juror.  He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the 
Defendant nor in favor of the Government.  He asserted that he would be able to assess the 
credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse.  And he affirmed that the subject matter of the 
case would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor 
would he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or 
impartial.    
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental 
briefing on Juror 50’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submitted on March 15, 2022.  
Dkt. Nos. 648, 649.2

The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants “the right to a speedy and public

On April 1, 2022, the Defendant requested the Court stay its ruling pending the release of a documentary in which 
Juror 50 is expected to appear.  Dkt. No. 651.  That request is denied.  The Defendant provides no basis to conclude 
that the interview would affect the Court’s analysis or conclusion having held an evidentiary hearing.

willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.”  Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 217 
(1982).  One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which 
“expos[es] possible biases, both known and unknown, on the part of potential jurors,” by 
eliciting information under oath.  McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 
554 (1984). 
Once a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and 
the moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof.  United States v. Ventura, No. 
09-CR-1015 (JGK), 2014 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2014); see United States v. 
Ianniello, 866 F.2d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 1989).  And while Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 
permits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so 
requires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), the Second Circuit has cautioned district courts that “such 
action must be done ‘sparingly’ and in ‘the most extraordinary circumstances.’”  United States v. 
Archer, 977 F.3d 181, 187 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 134 
(2d Cir. 2001)). 
The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s alleged 
nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984).  Maxwell Br. at 22–28, Dkt. No. 642; Gov. Br. at 11, Dkt. No. 
643.  In McDonough, the Supreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror 
nondisclosure during voir dire, “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer 
honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would 
have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”  McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also 
United States v. Shaoul, 41 F.3d 811, 815–16 (2d Cir. 1994). 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 12 of 40
A-329
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page129 of 221

         The parties dispute whether the first prong of McDonough requires “deliberate juror 
misconduct”—that is, whether the juror must have deliberately provided a false answer in voir 
dire.  The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul, 
argues that a deliberate falsehood is required.  Gov. Br. at 13 (citing Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 815–16).  
In contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an 
inadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong.  Maxwell Br. at 23–28; Maxwell Reply at 9–
14, Dkt. No. 644.3  The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the 
analysis section below, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the 
false answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.  
Under the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have 
granted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately.  United 
States v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, 171 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 304 
(2d Cir. 2006).  “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or 
inferable bias.”  Greer, 285 F.3d at 171.  These categories do not always elucidate the analysis 
and there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in how they are discussed in some of the cases.  
Nevertheless, it is important to attempt to delineate.  Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to 
the juror admitting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire 
answers.  United States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1997).  Implied bias is “bias 
presumed as a matter of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the 
actual crime itself.  Greer, 285 F.3d at 171–72.  Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or 
implied bias does not apply.  “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a 
risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse 
In an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is 
not required under McDonough.  See Dkt. No. 614. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 13 of 40

the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.”  Id. at 171  
(quoting Torres, 128 F.3d at 47).  The ensuing determination of whether the juror was biased or 
prejudiced against the defendant may be “affected both by whether the nondisclosure was 
deliberate and, if it was, by the juror’s motivation to conceal the truth.”  United States v. McCoy, 
995 F.3d 32, 51 (2d Cir. 2021); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at 172–73.  It is important to consider 
whether a juror’s answer was dishonest in the second part of the test “because it can show ‘a 
personal interest in this particular case that was so powerful as to cause the juror to commit a 
serious crime [by lying during voir dire].’”  United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 420, 438 
(W.D.N.Y. 2017), aff’d sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2021) (alteration 
in original) (quoting United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d 149, 151 (2d Cir. 1989)). 
The McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 606, which states:  
During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify 
about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the 
effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes 
concerning the verdict or indictment.  The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or 
evidence of a juror’s statement on these matters. 
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1).  As explained in this Court’s prior opinion, the rule is subject to certain 
exceptions inapplicable here.  See Feb. 25, 2022 Op. & Order, at 12.  The rule, which embodies 
“long-accepted Federal law,” is an important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system. 
Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 120–21 (1987) (rejecting a constitutional challenge to the 
rule).  It enables “full and frank discussion in the jury room” and secures “jurors’ willingness to 
return an unpopular verdict.”  Id.  Without the rule, the finality of verdicts, upon which the 
system relies, would be seriously disrupted.  See id. at 120–21, 124–25; see also Warger v. 
Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 45, 49–50 (2014).  And though not at issue in this case, the rule plays a 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 14 of 40
A-331
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page131 of 221

critical role in those extreme cases where dissatisfied litigants may be tempted to harass or 
tamper with jurors in an attempt to impeach the verdict.  See Tanner, 483 U.S. at 120–21.     
Finally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have 
exercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual 
abuse.  Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a 
new trial because Juror 50’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise 
her peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court.  Indeed, in making this argument 
she cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law.  Maxwell Br. at 46–47.  But the rule 
in New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court.  See State v. Scher, 650 
A.2d 1012, 1019–20 (N.J. App. Div. 1994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its 
federal counterpart” of McDonough).  Under McDonough, a defendant seeking a new trial must 
show that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”  464 
U.S. at 555–56 (emphasis added).  A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the 
peremptory challenge process” is not enough.  Id.; see also Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 816 (concluding 
that a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may 
certainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for 
arguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause”).  That difference 
arises in part from the fact that “[u]nlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not 
constitutionally required.”  Torres, 128 F.3d at 43 n.4. 
III. 
ANALYSIS 
A. McDonough Prong One 
The Court begins with what Juror 50’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:  
Juror 50 provided inaccurate answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire.  For each 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 15 of 40
A-332
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page132 of 221

of these questions, Juror 50 answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct 
answer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family 
member)” for Question 49.  Hearing Tr. at 7–12.  Those three inaccurate answers all stem from 
Juror 50’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child.  Under the Defendant’s 
interpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong.  But the 
Government’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate 
answers were made deliberately. 
After close consideration of the record, including Juror 50’s testimony under oath, the 
Court concludes that Juror 50’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not 
deliberately inaccurate.  Rather, for the reasons that follow, the Court credits Juror 50’s 
explanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and 
provided inadvertently inaccurate responses.  Id. at 12. 
As a preliminary matter, Juror 50 testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.  
Id. at 5.  He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing.  Juror 50 
therefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully. 
Moreover, the Court credits Juror 50’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying 
under oath.  At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 50 as he testified and to 
assess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the 
overall tone of his answers.  Juror 50 answered the Court’s questions in a calm and 
straightforward manner.  He was apologetic for his carelessness.  His tone, demeanor, and 
responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. 
Further, Juror 50’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and 
generally internally consistent.  He testified that his attention to the questionnaire was distracted 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 16 of 40
A-333
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page133 of 221

by several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security 
line, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering 
questions.  And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a 
romantic relationship.  Id. at 14 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was sitting there 
twiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and 
sitting in my feelings and not very focused.”).  That explanation is not only consistent with his 
other hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire.  See 
Nov. 16, 2021 Voir Dire Tr. at 133 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t 
want to see anything regarding them”). 
Distractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire.  Juror 50 
testified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed 
questionnaires.  As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at 
that table increased.  And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt 
rushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire.  Hearing Tr. at 18.  
Moreover, the Court credits Juror 50’s candid admission that he was not concerned with 
following the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had 
concluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were 
there.”  Id. at 13, 18; see also id. at 40. 
This explanation coheres with Juror 50’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not 
a salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire.  He repeatedly 
testified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse.  See, e.g., id. at 16, 22.  The 
summary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the 
Defendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 17 of 40
A-334
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page134 of 221

sexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his own sexual 
abuse.  Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4.  The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable. 
Last, the Court finds Juror 50’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to 
be the most logical explanation of his overall behavior.  Shortly after trial, Juror 50 readily 
disclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first 
name and pictures of himself.  Finding that Juror 50 intentionally provided false answers on the 
questionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful 
deception in public interviews.  The more likely explanation for Juror 50’s behavior is the one to 
which he credibly testified: Juror 50’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he 
was made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews.  That explanation 
is corroborated by a video recording of Juror 50’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the 
Defendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.  
See Maxwell Br. at 39–40.  In that video, Juror 50 states that he was asked only about the sexual 
abuse history of his friends and family but not his own.  When the interviewer asks Juror 50 
about Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the 
questionnaire included this question.  That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 50’s 
hearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but 
honest, mistake.  See Hearing Tr. at 15 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may 
ask about his own sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter 
Laura Collins”). 
The Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror 
committed perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally 
inaccurate.  The Court is not persuaded.  First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 50’s 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 18 of 40
A-335
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page135 of 221

testimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.”  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, 10, Dkt. No. 649.  
Juror 50 certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with 
what any good counsel would have recommended he do.  It is unremarkable that Juror 50 would 
have reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for 
anticipated questions.  The Court did not detect in Juror 50’s responses any fabrication or 
improper rehearsal of a false narrative.  Cf. Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x 10, 12 (2d Cir. 2020) 
(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness 
did “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially 
life-altering hearing”).  As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 50’s personal interests 
were served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges. 
Second, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 50 “did not see the word 
‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48.  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8.  She notes 
that he answered fifty-two prior questions and follow-up questions with the word “you” and that 
it is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family.  Yet the Court, in 
several lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 50’s testimony and is 
satisfied by his answers.  The Court first observed to Juror 50 that throughout the questionnaire, 
he “appeared to have followed the instructions.”  Hearing Tr. at 19.  When asked how he 
correctly followed the instructions elsewhere, Juror 50 explained, as he had previously in his 
testimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus” 
and so more able to respond accurately.  Id.  That focus waned, he explained, in reading later 
questions, including Question 48. 
Additionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48, 
asking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 19 of 40
A-336
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page136 of 221

yes friend or family, or no.”  Id. at 15, 21.  Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the 
questionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that pattern when filling out the 
questionnaire, id. at 15, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and 
then ‘yes self’ while reading,” Question 48, id. at 21.  And when asked a follow-up question, 
Juror 50 said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking now” that the 
questionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a 
juror’s own sexual abuse history.  Id. at 21–22.  The Court finds that Juror 50’s answers to each 
of these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible. 
Third, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 50 was inconsistent in first 
stating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,” 
but then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they 
lived with us for a few years.”  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9–10 (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, 11).  
The Court acknowledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that 
tension suggests Juror 50 deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse.  Juror 50’s explanation 
of his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages.  He clarified, first, that on November 4, 
he “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question 
as he “flew through” the questionnaire.  Hearing Tr. at 11–12.  At the hearing, he initially 
stated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered” 
the stepbrother to be a member of his family.  Id.  And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he] 
sit[s] here now,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 50 said “it would have been 
yes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.”  Id. at 12–13.  In short, it 
was only after Juror 50 was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 20 of 40
A-337
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page137 of 221

accurate response.  Yet Juror 50 did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his 
answer to it on November 4. 
These evolving answers do not reflect Juror 50 changing his story so much as an 
explanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before.  The 
Court is cognizant that jurors may well assign their own emotional connotations to terms like 
“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an attorney or judge.  
Cf. United States v. Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Would a reasonable 
juror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”). 
Fourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 50’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual 
abuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct.  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5–6, 10–11.  In 
particular, Juror 50 testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse.  Hearing 
Tr. at 22.  Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he 
revealed his sexual abuse history.  Further, Juror 50 posted a comment on social media to Annie 
Farmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.”  Id. at 43.  
These prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 50’s 
statement that he rarely disclosed that abuse. 
The Court confronted Juror 50 at length about each of these purported contradictions.  As 
to his interviews, the Court asked Juror 50 how he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about 
nondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews.  Id. at 22.  Juror 50 primarily 
provided two overlapping explanations.  He first testified that he “didn’t think this would 
happen.”  Id.  That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or 
friends would find this out,” despite the significant media attention that the case had received.  
Id. at 23.  When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 50 added that in the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 21 of 40
A-338
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page138 of 221

interviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 50 apparently understood reduced the 
chance that people that knew him would draw the connection.  Id. at 42.  And, further, he 
explained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial 
occurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not attract substantial attention.  
Second, Juror 50 simultaneously acknowledged that because of his interviews, the fact 
that he was abused “would be a known fact in the world.”  Id. at 24.  He explained that he had 
made a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter sitting on this trial for several 
weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.  
Id.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it.  It’s something that happened, and it’s 
something that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”). 
In short, Juror 50’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent 
between November 4, 2021, and January 2022.  He made a conscious decision to share the fact 
of his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed 
the questionnaire.  At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his 
interviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would 
not be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not followed the trial up to 
that point.  That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in 
his interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had 
occurred.  Juror 50’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to 
his post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended 
to deceive.  See Government Post-Hearing Br. at 10 n.4, Dkt. No. 648.  
The Court also asked Juror 50 about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer.  On 
Twitter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 50 and she said that 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 22 of 40
A-339
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page139 of 221

Juror 50 “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 50 responded by “thank[ing] her 
for sharing her[] [story] as well.”  Hearing Tr. at 43.  He explained that he had “randomly seen” 
Farmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.”  Id.  That comment was unlikely to be 
seen by Juror 50’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two 
followers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twitter.  Id.  The Court 
concludes that Juror 50’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twitter, made in January 2022, does not 
provide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2021, he did not tell many 
people about his sexual abuse. 
At bottom, based on Juror 50’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under 
oath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 50 credible.  His failure to attend with 
diligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire is frustrating and 
regrettable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception.  In light of his testimony, the Court 
finds that Juror 50’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect. 
B. McDonough Prong Two 
Assuming without deciding that Juror 50’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the 
first prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would 
have excused Juror 50 for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection 
accurately.  See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46.  At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 50 the same set of 
questions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal 
experience with sexual abuse.  Juror 50’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the 
hearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate 
responses to the questionnaire.

1. Actual Bias 
“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference 
that the person will not act with entire impartiality.”  Torres, 128 F.3d at 43.  A court may find a 
juror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire 
answers.  Id. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 980, 984 (2d Cir. 1968)).  This finding is 
“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.”  Id. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 
469 U.S. 412, 428 (1985)).  
The record does not support a finding that Juror 50 was actually biased.  As explained 
above, the Court finds Juror 50’s sworn testimony to be credible overall.  He was responsive and 
forthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully.  He 
repeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his 
ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.”  Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, 10, 
13.  He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would 
interfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he 
would be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the 
evidence suggested.  Id. at 26.  He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant 
nor any bias in favor of the Government.  Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale 
in any direction.”  Id.  He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.  
Id. at 27.  As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.”  Maxwell 
Post-Hearing Br. at 7.  The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.  
Moreover, Juror 50’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire. 
Without hesitation, he declared that he would follow the Court’s instructions on the law, he 
“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 24 of 40
A-341
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page141 of 221

he had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides, and he had no reason to think otherwise.  
Voir Dire Tr. at 128, 130, 134. 
The Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s arguments to the contrary.  The Defendant 
argues that Juror 50 was actually biased because his post-trial statements reveal that at the time 
of voir dire he regarded himself as a non-neutral advocate for the victims.  Maxwell Post-
Hearing Br. at 6.4  In particular, she relies on Juror 50’s post-trial interviews, in which he 
“proclaim[ed]” that the guilty verdict was for “for all the victims.”  Id.  But these post-trial 
statements do not establish that Juror 50 was actually biased against the Defendant.  The 
evidence at trial established that there was more than one victim of the Defendant’s crimes, 
making Juror 50’s post-trial statement reasonable.  And, more importantly, Juror 50’s view of the 
Defendant after the thirteen-day trial, during which he heard evidence that swayed him and 
eleven other jurors to convict the Defendant on five counts, does not shed light on any bias he 
allegedly harbored “before he heard the evidence presented.”  Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 439–
& n.4 (emphasis in original) (rejecting argument that juror’s post-trial statements that the 
verdict was “a victory for the little guy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant 
“thought she was above everything” revealed bias).   
2. Implied and Inferred Bias  
The Defendant’s central argument is that the Court should imply—based on Juror 50’s 
personal history of sexual abuse, post-trial actions, and hearing testimony—that Juror 50 was 
biased against the Defendant.  She similarly argues that the Court should infer Juror 50’s bias 
In her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant reserved arguing that Juror 50 was actually biased in the event the Court 
held an evidentiary hearing.  Maxwell Br. at 39.  The Defendant does not expressly argue that Juror 50 was actually 
biased in her post-hearing briefing, but the Court understands this argument to raise an actual bias issue.  See 
Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 2–3.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 25 of 40
A-342
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page142 of 221

based on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial.  Because 
these arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.5  
“Implied bias” is “a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a 
conclusive presumption of bias as a matter of law.”  McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations 
omitted) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at 172).  Such bias is “attributed to a prospective juror 
regardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position 
of the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.”  Torres, 128 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v. 
Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 133 (1936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984.  The category applies to 
“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of 
partiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.”  Torres, 128 F.3d at 41.  
Namely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the 
alleged crime itself are impliedly biased.  Id. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at 172.  
On the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s 
discretion.  Greer, 285 F.3d at 171; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.  “Bias may be inferred when 
a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant 
granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make 
mandatory a presumption of bias.”  Greer, 285 F.3d at 171 (quoting Torres, 128 F.3d at 47)).  
The inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in 
question would not be able to decide the matter objectively.”  Torres, 128 F.3d at 47.  If such 
facts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or 
her ability to be impartial become irrelevant.”  Id.  However, “a judge may—particularly when 
It is unsettled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial 
allegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at 172.  Because the Court determines that Juror 50 is neither 
impliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 26 of 40
A-343
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page143 of 221

considering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to show inferable bias—
ask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” Id. 
at 47 n.12.  For example, in Torres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its 
discretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had 
engaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the 
case.  But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept 
the juror.  Id. at 46–48. 
The Court concludes that Juror 50 is neither impliedly nor inferably biased.  First, none 
of the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a matter of law 
apply here.  McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48.  Juror 50 was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is 
he related to any of the attorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants.  See Nix, 275 F. 
Supp. 3d at 451.  Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause 
based on implied bias even if Juror 50 had provided correct answers to the questionnaire. 
Second, Juror 50’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality 
sufficient to infer that Juror 50 was biased against the Defendant.  The Court need not imagine a 
wholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion.  That is because the voir dire provides highly 
relevant indications of how the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 50 provided 
accurate answers during jury selection.  A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes 
(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror 
for cause.  It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one 
been raised.  See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.   
Eight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.  
The Court asked every follow-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 27 of 40
A-344
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page144 of 221

personal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these 
eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follow-up questions.  The Defendant did not 
challenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question 
48.   
Some of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 50—for 
example, sexual harassment on the subway.  Two jurors, however, disclosed experiences similar 
to that of Juror 50, neither of whom was challenged for cause.  Juror A reported that she was 
“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was 12, 13.”6  Although this juror was even closer in 
age to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone 
familiar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant 
did not propose any follow-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause.  Like Juror 
A, Juror 50 credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair 
or impartial nor would the subject matter “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him] 
from [his] duty as a juror.”  See Hearing Tr. at 26–27.  Next, Juror B explained that just two 
years before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused 
by a professor.  At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any 
way interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case 
that arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse.  She affirmed that 
it would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause.  Like Juror B, Juror 50 credibly 
affirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might 
To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to 
specific juror numbers.  See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006); Press-Enter. Co. v.

be discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the 
case.”  See Hearing Tr. at 27.7   
Accordingly, even if Juror 50 had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court 
would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective 
jurors who disclosed similar experiences.  This is so because our system of trial by jury does not 
exclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can 
serve fairly and impartially.  This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who 
had a family member murdered was not struck for cause.  So too victims of fraud serve faithfully 
in fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in 
discrimination trials.    
So the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the 
case based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias, 
prejudice, or sympathy.  See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 813, 818 (2d Cir. 1970).  
Juror 50 repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that.  And for all the reasons 
articulated above, the Court found that testimony credible.  To imply or infer that Juror 50 was 
biased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse 
and sex trafficking, and despite his own credible testimony under the penalty of perjury, 
establishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to 
concluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and 
In her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to 
excuse 67 of the 114 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the 
Defendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes 
(self).”  Maxwell Br. at 9–10.  But that is a mischaracterization.  First, a significant number of those prospective 
jurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons.  Second, and as noted above, all of 
those excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability 
to be impartial.”  Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 439.  “The question now is whether [Juror 50’s] omission reveals a 
bias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.”  Id.  As explained above, it does not.

impartial juror in such a trial.  That is not the law, nor should it be.  See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99 
F.3d 978, 989–90 (10th Cir. 1996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror 
in a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.”); 
Buckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 906, 914–15 (5th Cir. 2019) (affirming conclusion that juror who 
failed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a 
child).  Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 50 is biased. 
The Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that 
Juror 50 was neither impliedly nor inferably biased.  First, the Defendant argues that Juror 50 
was impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.”  Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell 
Post-Hearing Br. at 11.8  But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire 
to be selected.  By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively 
relies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.”  867 F. Supp. 
2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse, 
789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2015).  The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial, 
emphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted 
“extraordinary relief.”  Id. at 468.  Such is not the case here.  The Court credits Juror 50’s 
explanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.  
Hearing Tr. at 14–15.  Juror 50 explained how the circumstances surrounding his completion of 
the questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being 
selected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally 
distracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal 
The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 50’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.  
Maxwell Br. at 36.  For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 50 used social media 
accounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media 
before trial.  Feb. 25, 2020 Op. & Order, at 9–10.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 30 of 40
A-347
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page147 of 221

aspect of Questions 48 and 49.  As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to 
be selected.  The Court finds Juror 50’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and 
does not find as a factual matter that Juror 50 deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.    
The Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d 150 (1st Cir. 2013), is 
similarly unavailing.  See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 11.  There, a juror failed to disclose that 
her husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank 
robbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint.  However, the juror 
had told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her 
daughter’s incarceration and her own substance abuse issues.  Id. at 161–62, 168.  By contrast, 
Juror 50’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire, 
stems only from his experience of sexual abuse.  
Second, the Defendant contends that Juror 50 was biased due to the “similarities between 
[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.”  Maxwell Br. at 30 (quoting 
Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472).  She expressly disavows arguing “that every person who has 
been a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause 
based on implied bias.”  Maxwell Reply at 17.  Distancing from that position is necessary—
again, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and 
impartial juror.  Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 50’s personal 
history is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied 
bias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 50’s testimony 
and post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.  Maxwell 
Br. at 31–32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5–6.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 31 of 40
A-348
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page148 of 221

The Court is unpersuaded.  First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be 
implied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial.  The Defendant’s 
only in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas.  See Maxwell Br. at 30–35; 
Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5.  In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias 
‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being 
litigated.’”  867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 820 F. Supp. 2d 151, 164 
(D. Mass. 2011)).  But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias 
because that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed 
above) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and 
creation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.”  Id. at 472–74. 
The Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrow category.  
The circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions 
that jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which 
might bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no 
showing of actual bias or prejudice.’”  Torres, 128 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Brown, 
644 F.2d 101, 104–05 (2d Cir. 1981)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d 
Cir. 1991).  As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the 
trial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that 
were similar to conduct charged in the case.  128 F.3d at 46–47.  But the circuit “decline[d] to 
hold as a general matter that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the 
defendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.”  Id. at 46 (emphasis added).  As the court 
explained, “[s]uch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 32 of 40
A-349
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page149 of 221

removal.”  Id.  Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly 
limited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority.  Id.  
Second, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the 
voir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 50’s personal experience is not so 
similar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation.  Nor is it 
sufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias.  In arguing that 
Juror 50’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 50 was sexually 
abused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother, 
who was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.  
Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4.  He also delayed reporting the abuse.  Id.  But the Defendant 
overlooks the important differences.  Juror 50 was younger—ages 9 and 10—than the victims 
testified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein.  He disclosed his abuse 
to his mother in high school, unlike the victims here.  And unlike the period of two years of 
abuse that Juror 50 endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.  
Like Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 50 had 
disclosed his experience during jury selection.  The Court would have asked appropriate follow-
up questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those 
questions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.  
Juror 50 is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by 
the Defendant.  For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v. 
United States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a 
variety of issues.  724 F.3d at 161.  Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 33 of 40
A-350
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page150 of 221

Circuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing.  Maxwell Br. at 33 
(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at 168).   
The Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, 196 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2018), 
in which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose 
that a babysitter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old.  Maxwell Post-
Hearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34.  But that juror had previously reported an inability 
to be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that 
there was “little in the way of logical explanation for how he could have differentiated between 
the two cases.”  196 A.3d at 98.  Such is not the case here.  
Finally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly 
biased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that 
of the defendant.  948 F.2d 1150, 1158–59 (10th Cir. 1991).  However, not only had that juror 
deliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive 
situation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court.  Id.  
Conversely, Juror 50 credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not 
something that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].”  Hearing Tr. at 47.  And again, 
the Court has not found that Juror 50 deliberately lied about his personal history.     
The Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror 
is not biased.  The Defendant contends that Juror 50’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his 
posts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is 
“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak 
up his 15 minutes of fame.”  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 10–11.  The Court disagrees that this 
conduct reveals bias.  Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 34 of 40
A-351
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page151 of 221

following a high-profile trial does not establish bias.  This common occurrence is not necessarily 
nefarious.  See Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 440.  Even if Juror 50 were selfishly seeking his 
fifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media attention 
after a verdict of acquittal.”  Id.   
The Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror 
50] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”  
Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5–6.  She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’ 
testimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently 
normal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial.  Id.  As noted above in this Court’s finding 
that Juror 50 is not actually biased, Juror 50’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the 
verdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias.  A juror’s view of a case and defendant 
would necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors 
of the Defendant’s guilt.  See Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 439–40.  It is unsurprising that such an 
experience might change the way a juror views his own life experiences.             
The Defendant also argues that Juror 50 is biased because “his own experience of sexual 
abuse shaped his beliefs about how victims’ memories of traumatic events work.”  Maxwell 
Post-Hearing Br. at 6.  The Defendant relies on Juror 50’s statements in post-trial interviews and 
his hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial.  For example, Juror 50 noted at 
the hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury 
deliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was 
provided during the trial.”  Hearing Tr. at 22.  The Court does not agree, as an initial matter, that 
these statements demonstrate bias.  A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common 
sense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.  All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 35 of 40
A-352
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page152 of 221

personal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events.  So 
long as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the 
law as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our 
jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.”  U.S. 
ex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 818.  In any event, Rule 606(b) bars the Court from relying on these 
statements because they pertain to Juror 50’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or 
indictment.”  Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1).  “[P]arsing how jurors considered the evidence or their 
mental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 606(b) 
seek to prevent.”  United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2015) (cited favorably 
by United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 132 (2d Cir. 2018)); see also United States v. Abcasis, 
811 F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. 1992) (Rule 606 does not permit inquiry into jurors’ 
discussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).   
Finally, the Defendant argues that Juror 50’s statements about his “healing process” and 
his hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just how deeply the trauma affected him and 
continues to affect him.”  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9.  The Court is unpersuaded.  First, at 
the March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follow-up questions on 
Juror 50’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions 
during the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of 
sexual abuse on their questionnaires.  Hearing Tr. at 28–29.  Moreover, that an individual has 
undergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience 
interferes with his ability to be fair and impartial.  Juror 50 credibly testified that his sexual abuse 
is not usually on his mind, that the subject matter would not upset him in a way that would 
distract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his own experience in a way that 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 36 of 40
A-353
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page153 of 221

would prevent him from being fair or impartial.  As discussed above, the minor discrepancies 
raised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.9    
Nor was Juror 50’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable.  He testified that he 
understood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like 
that,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”  
Hearing Tr. at 10.  Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged 
or been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.  
That interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does 
not evince intentional deception or partiality.  Cf. United States v. Fell, No. 2:01-CR-12, 2014 
WL 3697810, at *7, *13 (D. Vt. July 24, 2014) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was 
sexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these 
years” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at 
555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English usage.  Called as they are from all walks of 
life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by 
lawyers and judges.”).  Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to 
not refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse.  For example, Juror C disclosed being “
,” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question 
25, reported only that a family member was mugged.  See Juror C Questionnaire. 
In sum, the Court concludes that Juror 50 is not impliedly or inferably biased.  
The Defendant also notes that Juror 50 apparently posted on social media about attending therapy to help “deal[] 
with the stress of the [Maxwell] case.”  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 20.  It is perfectly 
reasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.  In fact, 
courts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors following the completion of a trial.

3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument 
that Juror 50 was biased because he failed to follow instructions.  
In her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 50’s testimony that he was 
“absolutely not” concerned with following the Court’s instructions when filling out the 
questionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 50 was unable to serve as an 
unbiased juror.  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 11–12 (quoting Hearing Tr. at 18).  The Court 
disagrees.    
Juror 50’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the 
questionnaire session.  Juror 50 showed up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court 
that he was attentive throughout trial.  There is no indication that Juror 50 failed to follow this 
Court’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations.  Juror 50 explained that he was 
unconcerned with following the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because 
he was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for 
the jury.  Hearing Tr. at 40.  Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.”  Id. at 41.  When 
he answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “sitting there for 
hours . . . thinking about [his] ex.”  Id.  He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the 
Court’s questions.  This included affirming that he was able to follow the Court’s instructions as 
to the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on 
the case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knowledge to the 
side and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial.  Voir Dire 
Tr. at 128–31.  Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no 
effect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.”  Hearing Tr. at 
41.  The Court confirmed that Juror 50 “carefully” followed the Court’s instructions during voir 
dire and trial.  Id.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 38 of 40
A-355
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page155 of 221

Even if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 50’s 
“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shows an inability 
to serve as an unbiased juror.”  Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 11.  She relies on Dyer v. Calderon, 
151 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc), as her sole support.  But Dyer stands for the distinct 
proposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to 
“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.”  Id. at 983.  It does not support that an uncareful 
and inattentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury 
selection is biased.  As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 50 committed 
perjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury.  Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the 
Defendant’s motion on this basis.  
* * * 
In sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that 
Juror 50 was biased.  Juror 50’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality.  And Juror 50 
was not impliedly or inferably biased.  He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the 
actual crimes.  Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case 
participants.  And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the 
Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 50’s personal history of 
sexual abuse.  That Juror 50 was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was 
biased or failed to follow the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial.  Prong two of the 
demanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION  
For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 50 testified credibly and 
truthfully at the post-trial hearing.  His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 653   Filed 04/01/22   Page 39 of 40
A-356
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page156 of 221

selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.  The Court further concludes that 
Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the Defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror.  
The requirements for a new trial under McDonough are not satisfied.  The Defendant’s motion 
for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. 
The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation report. 
With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy Trial 
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from today’s date through April 22, 2022.  The Court finds that 
the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the 
interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending 
post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government’s January 10, 
2022 letter.  See Dkt. No. 574.  The Defendant consents to this exclusion.  Dkt. No. 650.  
The Court will rule on the Defendant’s remaining post-verdict motions in due course.  
Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2022.  This resolves docket numbers 613, 614, 642, 
650, and 651.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation: 
In 2020, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme 
to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her 
longtime companion.  The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from 
multiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical 
evidence.  The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming 
and recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.  
Following the thirteen-day trial, the Court submitted to the jury the six counts in the 
Indictment.  The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the 
six counts.  Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations 
of federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six.  The other three counts of conviction, 
Counts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to 
violate those same statutes from 1994 to 2004.   
Before the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative 
arguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction.  First, the Defendant argues 
that judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,

Three, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same 
offense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth 
Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause.  Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient 
evidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Third, the 
Defendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the 
convictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment.  And 
fourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government 
intentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution. 
With one exception, the motions are denied.  The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts 
of conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive 
witness testimony and documentary evidence admitted at trial.  Further, those counts of 
conviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the 
Government at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed.  The Defendant’s contrary 
claim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible 
and speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note.  In addition, the Court concludes 
that the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the 
Defendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay. 
The Court does conclude, however, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same 
offense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous.  The Government concedes that Count One is 
multiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless 
involve distinct conspiracies.  The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three, 
charges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the

Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein.  The overarching conspiracy—which, as 
the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually 
abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.  Because the 
Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same 
offense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts.  This 
legal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury.  Rather, it 
underscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of 
conspiring with Epstein to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.  
I. 
The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.  
The Defendant was indicted on six counts: (1) conspiracy to entice individuals under the 
age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal 
under New York law, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; (2) enticement of individuals under the 
age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal 
under New York law, and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3) 
conspiracy to transport individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce 
with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 371; (4) transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in 
sexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of 
eighteen, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of

eighteen, and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2.  S2 Indictment, 
Dkt. No. 187.1 
In two prior pretrial motions, the Defendant requested that the Court dismiss two of the 
three conspiracy counts—that is, Counts One, Three, and Five—as multiplicitous, given that all 
three were premised on the Defendant’s participation in a single criminal conspiracy with 
Epstein.  To punish her for all three counts, she argued, would violate the Double Jeopardy 
Clause.  In opinions dated April 16, 2021, and August 13, 2021, the Court denied those motions 
as premature because the Double Jeopardy Clause would prohibit only multiple punishments for 
the same offense, but not indictments for the same offense.  United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. 
Supp. 3d 299, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (citing United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d 
Cir. 2006)); United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-CR-330 (AJN), 2021 WL 3591801, at *5 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2021). 
Because the jury convicted the Defendant on all three conspiracy counts, the Defendant 
now requests that the Court impose judgment on only one of these counts.  Maxwell Br. at 19, 
Dkt. No. 600.  The Government concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous and 
agrees that the Court should not impose judgment on Count One, but it argues that Counts Three 
and Five are distinct offenses premised on distinct criminal conspiracies, and so the Court should 
impose judgment on both.  Gov. Br. at 24, Dkt. No. 621. 
On consent of both parties, the Court will not impose judgment on Count One because it 
is multiplicitous.  For the reasons that follow, the Court further grants the Defendant’s motion to 
also not enter judgment on Count Count Five because it is also multiplicitous with Count Three. 
The original and S2 Indictments also included two counts of perjury.  See S2 Indictment ¶¶ 28–31.  The Court 
granted the Defendant’s motion to sever those counts for a separate trial.  United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 
299, 321 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).

A. Applicable law 
The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall “be 
subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  
That guarantee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court 
does not “exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same 
offense.”  Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38, 
(2d Cir. 2001).  An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy, 
“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law 
and fact, only one crime has been committed.”  Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United 
States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999)).  “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, 
however, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’”  United States v. Jones, 
482 F.3d 60, 72 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 320 F.3d 173, 180 (2d Cir. 
2003)). 
If the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the 
multiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they 
involve the same agreement.  United States v. Araujo, No. 17-CR-438 (VEC), 2018 WL 
3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2018) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d 118, 124–25 
(2d Cir. 2004)); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 454 (2d Cir. 2004) (“[T]o survive a 
double jeopardy attack, the government would have to show that the two schemes involved 
‘distinct’ agreements.”).  Yet “whether the evidence shows a single conspiracy or more than one 
conspiracy is often not determinable as a matter of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”  
Jones, 482 F.3d at 72.  Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided by the Second 
Circuit’s Korfant factors.  See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 507 F. App’x 89, 91 (2d Cir. 2013) 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 5 of 45
A-362
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page162 of 221

(summary order) (citing United States v. Korfant, 771 F.2d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1985) (per 
curiam)); United States v. Villa, 744 F. App’x 716, 720 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order).  Those 
factors include: 
(1) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments; (2) the overlap of 
participants; (3) the overlap of time; (4) similarity of operation; (5) the existence 
of common overt acts; (6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or 
location where overt acts occurred; (7) common objectives; and (8) the degree of 
interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies. 
United States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 667 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting Korfant, 771 F.2d at 662).  In 
applying the Korfant factors, “no dominant factor or single touchstone” determines whether two 
allegedly distinct conspiracies “‘appear in fact and in law the same.’”  Id. at 668 (quoting United 
States v. Reiter, 848 F.2d 336, 340 (2d Cir. 1988)).  Moreover, “the Korfant list is not 
exhaustive, and every case must be assessed on its own terms . . . based on the entire record.”  
United States v. Maslin, 356 F.3d 191, 196 (2d Cir. 2004). 
In assessing the evidence, the Second Circuit applies a burden-shifting framework.  The 
defendant carries the initial burden of making a non-frivolous showing that the two counts in fact 
charge only one conspiracy.  If met, the burden then shifts to the Government to show, “by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the 
defendant is not being placed in jeopardy twice for the same crime.”  United States v. Lopez, 356 
F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing United States v. DelVecchio, 800 F.2d 21, 22 
(2d Cir. 1986)); see also United States v. Mallah, 503 F.2d 971, 986 (2d Cir. 1974) (applying this 
burden-shifting approach post-conviction); United States v. Hernandez, No. 09-CR-625 (HB), 
2009 WL 3169226, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2009).

B. Analysis 
A further summary of the two counts at issue is required.  As briefly outlined above, 
Count Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under 18 U.S.C. § 371, the general federal 
conspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by 
transporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by 
state law.  S2 Indictment ¶¶ 16–18.  In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal 
Law Section 130.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual known to be under the 
age of seventeen.  Trial Tr. 3034–35.  The Count Three conspiracy spanned from 1994 to 2004.  
S2 Indictment ¶ 17.  As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the 
Defendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer, 
three victims who testified at trial.  Trial Tr. at 2895.2 
Count Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under 18 U.S.C. § 371, but for 
conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by 
trafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate 
commerce.  S2 Indictment ¶¶ 22–24.  Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2001 to 2004.  Id. 
¶ 23.  The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five 
based on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts.  Trial Tr. at 2896. 
The Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is 
otherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors.  The Court agrees.  Although 
some Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a 
review of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not 
The Court permitted certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name.  See Nov. 1, 2021 Tr. at 
6–7.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 7 of 45
A-364
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page164 of 221

met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not 
multiplicitous. 
The offenses charged and common objectives.  Both Counts Three and Five are charged 
under the same statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United 
States.  But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two 
counts differ.  Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669.  Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and 
Count Five a conspiracy to violate § 1591.  These differing statutory objectives entail legal 
differences.  Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual 
touching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor.  And 
each provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under 
eighteen years old for Count Five.  Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to 
transport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity 
that affects interstate commerce.  These differences push the first Korfant factor in the 
Government’s favor.  See Estrada, 320 F.3d at 182 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:12-CR-40 (JBA), 
2014 WL 252013, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2014), aff’d, 744 F. App’x 716 (2d Cir. 2018) 
(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 371 conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate 
shipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”). 
The Government, however, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the 
Defendant’s multiplicity claim.  Gov. Br. at 29.  To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is 
dominant or dispositive.  Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668.  And courts in this district have found two 
conspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives 
because both counts can arise from the same agreement.  E.g., Hernandez, 2009 WL 3169226, at 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 8 of 45
A-365
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page165 of 221

*11 (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire 
fraud were the same conspiracy as earlier conspiracy to use or transfer false IDs).  After all, “[a] 
single agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.”  United States v. Broce, 
488 U.S. 563, 570–71 (1989).  The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it 
agreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous.  Count One charges a conspiracy to 
entice minors to travel across state lines in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three 
charges a conspiracy to transport minors across state lines in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a).  
Despite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 371 conspiracies, the Government did not 
contest that they were the same offense.  Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to 
Count Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the matter.  It 
is well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the 
objectives share important similarities, as they do here.  United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 
148 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d 1512, 1518 (2d Cir. 1992)). 
Overlap of participants.  The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and 
Five substantially overlap with one another.  Of course, the defendant will always overlap 
between two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has 
negligible significance.  Villa, 2014 WL 252013, at *5.  More importantly here, Epstein was the 
Defendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both 
conspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to 
sexually abuse.  They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade 
alleged in the Indictment.  E.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 41 (“For a decade, the 
defendant played an essential role in this scheme.”).  This overlap in key participants, and in core 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 9 of 45
A-366
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page166 of 221

roles played by those participants, significantly favors the Defendant as to the second Korfant 
factor.  See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2009 WL 3169226, at *11.          
The Government responds that the Count Five conspiracy included Sarah Kellen, who 
was not involved in Count Three.  Yet Kellen received far less attention than other conspirators 
in the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement 
and closing arguments.  E.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call, 
too”).  Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct conspiracy, 
particularly if key members of the conspiracy remain over the course of a decade.  See United 
States v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2008).  Kellen’s participation beginning in 2001 
therefore does not shift the import of the second Korfant factor. 
Overlap of time.  The time periods of the two counts overlap completely.  Namely, Count 
Five’s period of 2001 to 2004 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from 1994 to 
2004, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor.  United States v. 
Calderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1992).  The Government’s attempt to minimize this factor 
by noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the 1990s is simply not reflected in 
this circuit’s case law.  See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame 
alleged in the indictment).  The overlap in time here raises the inference that one conspiracy 
wholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor.  See Araujo, 
2018 WL 3222527, at *6. 
Similarity of operations.  Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in 
operations.  The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of 
minor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial.  The Government called as an 
expert witness Dr. Lisa Rocchio, who identified the typical steps in sexual abusers’ grooming of 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 10 of 45
A-367
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page167 of 221

minors for sexual abuse.  Trial Tr. at 714–19.  Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’ 
testimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim followed a 
uniform “playbook.”  E.g., id. at 2184 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.  
She manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”), 2853 (“The patterns you 
saw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways 
that you know that Maxwell is guilty.”).  And the Government emphasized the many similarities 
in the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses.  Id. at 2848 (“The similarities 
between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly powerful 
evidence of the defendant’s guilt.  So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran 
again and again and again.”), 2901 (“Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.  
They all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”).  Carolyn was the only witness who 
testified regarding Count Five.  The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by 
what Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and how she operated for years.”  
Id. at 2880; see also id. at 2895–96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a 
broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”).  The 
Government, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for 
a decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five. 
The Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired 
to sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2001 evolved from developing one-
on-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they 
acquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments.  Gov. Br. at 32 
(quoting Trial Tr. at 40).  To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its 
closing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 11 of 45
A-368
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page168 of 221

a decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.”  Trial Tr. at 40; see 
also, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2001 as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”).  But 
a single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a 
discontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving 
the same roles in each phase.  United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 51 (2d Cir. 2021) 
(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d 107, 114–15 (2d Cir. 2000)); see 
also United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. 1990).  Notably, the 
Government, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the pattern of abuse, 
immediately emphasized that “[f]or a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this 
scheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases.  Trial Tr. at 41. 
Moreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor 
victims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its 
brief.  As to both counts, both before and after 2001, the Government emphasized that massage 
was a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the 
means by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.  
Compare id. at 40 (“You will learn that in the 1990s, they used the cover of mentoring young 
girls . . . to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages 
as a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 41 (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse, 
the defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash 
afterwards . . . .”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way 
the defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again throughout 
this trial, you heard about how these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey 
Epstein.”). 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 12 of 45
A-369
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page169 of 221

Further, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and 
payments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and 
extended the period of sexual abuse.  E.g., id. at 302 (Jane testified that she was given money 
“[a]lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes).  The 
Government emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of 
grooming.  E.g., id. at 2851 (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel 
special, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their 
futures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice 
lessons and tuition.”), 2890 (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for 
school.  That money wasn’t free . . . .  That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.”).  
The financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2001, but that shift in 
approach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time 
entered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.”  Haji v. Miller, 584 F. 
Supp. 2d 498, 519 (E.D.N.Y. 2008).  The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the 
Defendant. 
         Overlap of geographic scope.  There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap 
between the two counts.  Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate 
objective of the conspiracy was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual 
activity in violation of New York law.  Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence 
in Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.  
Nevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained.  All four witnesses 
testified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York, 
whether Florida, New Mexico, or London.  The Court admitted such testimony concerning 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 13 of 45
A-370
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page170 of 221

sexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the 
existence of a conspiracy and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New 
York.  In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for 
both counts.  And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations 
do[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.”  Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 48 
(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72).  This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral. 
         Common overt acts.  The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the 
jury for Counts Three and Five are distinct.  See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49–50.  This factor 
therefore tips toward the Government—but only slightly.  A number of the overt acts listed for 
Count Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that 18 U.S.C. § 1591, 
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2000.  See Gov. Br. at 28.  That 
some identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of 
legal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies.  Cf. Hernandez, 2009 WL 3169226, 
at *12. 
         Interdependence.  Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or 
failure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other.  See Macchia, 35 
F.3d at 671.  In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn 
from 2001 to 2004 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane, 
Annie, or any other underage girl.  This factor, however, makes little difference in the final 
analysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.”  Maslin, 356 F.3d at 197.        
The Government’s theory at trial.  The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to 
consider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record.  See id. at 
196; United States v. Olmeda, 461 F.3d 271, 282 (2d Cir. 2006).  In Maslin, the Second Circuit 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 14 of 45
A-371
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page171 of 221

first explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive 
prosecutions for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then 
continued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further 
point toward a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening 
and closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially 
identical nature.”  356 F.3d at 197.  The same is true here.  As explained above, the 
Government’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular 
conspiracy, highlighting:  The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience 
over a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,” 
Trial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein.  And each of 
those features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim 
witnesses.  Id. at 36, 2843, 2853.  At bottom, the case presented to the jury by the Government 
was of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage 
girls.  Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot now 
claim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count 
Five was legally and factually distinct.  See Maslin, 356 F.3d at 197. 
         Because Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter 
judgment on only one of the counts.  See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on 
more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for 
the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the 
multiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 470 U.S. 856, 865 (1985))).  Because Count 
Five is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count 
Three.  The Court emphasizes, however, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not

A-372
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page172 of 221

overturn any of the factual findings made by the jury” —it means only that, “as a matter of law, 
the jury found the same thing twice.”  Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at 125.  Or, in this case, three times. 
II. 
The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion. 
The Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of 
conviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts under 
Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that 
“[a]fter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the 
defendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is 
insufficient to sustain a conviction.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9, 
(2d Cir. 2019).  “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support 
a criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably 
support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318 
(1979).  “The court must make that determination with the evidence against a particular 
defendant, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable 
inferences resolved in favor of the government.”  Pugh, 945 F.3d at 19 (cleaned up) (quoting 
Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 45).  Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing 
the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have 
found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319 
(citing Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 362 (1972)); United States v. Zhong, 26 F.4th 536, 
560 (2d Cir. 2022).          
At the close of the Government’s case, the Defendant made her Rule 29 application “with 
respect to every count in the S2 indictment,” but “confine[d] [her] comments to address 
specifically Counts One and Two.”  Trial Tr. at 2266.  The Court denied the motion.  Id. at 2274.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 16 of 45
A-373
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page173 of 221

Following the close of the defense case, the Defendant renewed her previous Rule 29 
application.  Id. at 2736.    
In her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request that the Court “enter a judgment of 
acquittal as to all counts.”  Maxwell Br. at 30.  The Court has deemed Counts One and Five 
multiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.  
And at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two.  Thus, the Court will 
consider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six.  After 
considering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion. 
The Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the 
sufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for 
Counts Three, Four, or Six.  Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts 
that the Court should “enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because 
the government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”  
Maxwell Reply at 18, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 30.  The Court disagrees. 
The Court first considers the substantive counts.  Count Four charged the Defendant with 
the substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to 
engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.  This count related only to Jane during 
the period 1994 to 1997.  The Government was required to establish the following elements 
beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the Defendant knowingly transported an individual in 
interstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the 
individual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any 
person can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment; 
and (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 17 of 45
A-374
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page174 of 221

of the acts alleged in Count Four; or that the Defendant aided and abetted the same.  Jury Charge 
at 26, 37.  
The Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant 
guilty of Count Four beyond a reasonable doubt.  Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in 
sexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old.  Trial Tr. at 305.  She 
then began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same 
age.  Id. at 315–16.  Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private 
jet.  Id. at 316.  She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that 
the Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York.  Id. at 316–17.  On 
one occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble getting on a commercial 
flight because she did not have proper identification.  However, the Defendant “made it happen” 
for her by making a call and helping her get on the flight.  Id. at 323–24.  Jane also testified that 
the Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York 
when she was under the age of seventeen.  Id. at 320.  The Court concludes that this evidence, 
taken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant 
knowingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal 
under New York law, or at minimum, aided and abetted Epstein in doing so.    
Next, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the 
Defendant guilty of Count Six.  Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of 
sex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen.  The Government was required to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the Defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, 
transported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under 
the age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 18 of 45
A-375
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page175 of 221

commercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or 
that the Defendant aided and abetted the same.  Jury Charge at 32, 37.  Count Six applied solely 
to Carolyn during the period 2001 to 2004.  Id. at 32.   
Carolyn testified that when she was under the age of eighteen, the Defendant would call 
her to set up appointments for Carolyn to perform sexualized massages on Epstein.  Trial Tr. 
1527, 1530.  Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages.  Id. at 
1544–47.  Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued 
to call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein.  Id. at 1538.  She recalled a specific 
incident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant 
touched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his 
friends.”  Id. at 1536–38.  Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age 
of eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that 
fact.  Id. at 1535.  Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing 
sexualized massages on Epstein.  E.g., id. 1523.  She recalled that while money was often left on 
the sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or 
two occasions.  Id. at 1540–41.  Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s 
boyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads.  This evidence was 
plainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant committed 
sex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abetted Epstein in doing so.3       
If the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion 
as to Count Five.  Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of 
individuals under the age of eighteen from about 2001 to 2004.  The evidence that supports the Defendant’s 
conviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction.  Additionally, 
Juan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at 
Epstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day.  Trial Tr. at 841–43.  Documentary evidence, including flight records, 
established that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein.  See, e.g., id. at 
1855 (December 2000 flight record including Epstein, the Defendant, and Virginia); see also GX-14 (birth 
certificate).  Carolyn testified that Virginia recruited her and that Virginia performed sexualized massages on 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 19 of 45
A-376
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page176 of 221

Finally, Count Three charged the Defendant with conspiracy to transport individuals 
under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illegal sexual 
activity in violation of New York law.  The Government was required to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt: (1) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2) 
the Defendant knowingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the 
members of the conspiracy knowingly committed at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that 
the jury found to have been committed was committed in furtherance of that conspiracy.  Jury 
Charge at 41. 
The Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt for each element of Count Three.  The Government presented evidence that 
could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between 1994 
and 2004 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual 
activity illegal under New York law.  As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to 
New York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused.  Trial Tr. at 319–20.  
Jane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel 
comfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel.  Id. 
299–303; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior toward her made her “feel 
special”).     
Other witnesses testified to similar conduct.  Annie testified that after she met Epstein in 
New York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she 
was sixteen.  Id. at 2068–69, 2075–77.  She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein 
took her shopping and to the movies.  Id. at 2080–81.  She also testified that the Defendant 
Epstein in exchange for money.  Trial Tr. 1518–24.  The Court concludes that the evidence related to Carolyn and 
Virginia was sufficient for the jury to convict the Defendant on Count Five.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 20 of 45
A-377
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page177 of 221

encouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during 
which the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts.  Id. at 2083–86.  As noted above, Carolyn testified 
that the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein.  She also testified 
that Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics 
with her.  Id. at 1533–36.  Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited 
her to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.  Id. at 1535, 1540.  A reasonable juror 
could have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to 
normalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the 
Caribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for 
the purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law.  Finally, although the 
jury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s 
testimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s 
knowledge and role in the conspiracy.  Id. at 1177–90.  The Court concludes that this evidence 
was sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport 
individuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New 
York law.  
Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of 
acquittal. 
III. 
The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or 
prejudicial variance.  
The Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four 
(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33.  She contends that the 
jury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than 
New York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 21 of 45
A-378
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page178 of 221

prejudicial variance.  For the following reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s 
motion on this basis. 
A. Applicable Law 
Under the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “a defendant has the right to be tried 
only on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.”  United States v. Wozniak, 
126 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 1997).  “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs 
significantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment 
occurs and reversal is required.  United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2021).   
“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either 
the proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge 
that, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the 
subject of the grand jury’s indictment.”  United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 620 (2d Cir. 
2003) (quoting United States v. Frank, 156 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. 1998)).  In making this 
determination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged.  United 
States v. Gross, No. 15-cr-769 (AJN), 2017 WL 4685111, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2017), aff’d 
sub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40 (2d Cir. 2019).  The “core of criminality . . . 
involves the essence of a crime, in general terms.”  United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 212, 
225 (2d Cir. 2016) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 418 
(2d Cir. 2012)).  The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial 
created a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in 
that core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.”  D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 416, 419.  The 
Second Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility in proof, provided that the 
defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”  United States v. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 22 of 45
A-379
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page179 of 221

Banki, 685 F.3d 99, 118 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 228 (2d 
Cir. 2007)).  Thus, the defendant must show that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions 
tied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the 
indictment.’”  United States v. Bastian, 770 F.3d 212, 223 (2d Cir. 2014) (emphasis added) 
(quoting United States v. Danielson, 199 F.3d 666, 670 (2d Cir. 1999)).    
By contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left 
unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the 
indictment.”  Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 621 (quoting Frank, 156 F.3d at 337 n.5).  “Although the 
distinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear ‘merely one of degree,’ 
there is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is 
considered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must show 
prejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’”  Id. (quoting Frank, 156 F.3d at 337 n.5); see 
also Rigas, 490 F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must show ‘substantial prejudice’ 
to warrant reversal.”).  “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a 
variance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of 
a character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as 
to deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same 
offense.”  Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 621–22).  Moreover, when 
a defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she 
was unfairly or substantially prejudiced.  See United States v. Kaplan, 490 F.3d 119, 129–30 (2d 
Cir. 2007). 
Finally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule 
33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 23 of 45
A-380
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page180 of 221

justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a).  Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most 
extraordinary circumstances, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.” 
United States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). 
B. No constructive amendment occurred. 
Count Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of 
seventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy 
to do the same.  The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by 
Epstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they 
would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.  Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4   
The Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the 
jury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality.  Namely, the 
Defendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to 
engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in 
sexual activity in New York.  Maxwell Reply at 2.  She argues the Court’s decision to refer the 
jury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error.  As a result of 
this same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three.  For the reasons 
that follow, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant 
was “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.”  D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 
416 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. 1988)).   
The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.  
Because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count 
One here.  In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as 
her argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same.  See Maxwell Br. at 16.

1. The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s 
summation captured the core of criminality.  
First, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence 
captured the core of criminality.  As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with 
four counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law 
Section 130.55.  That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual 
known to be under the age of seventeen.  Jury Charge at 24.  The jury charge made clear that this 
provision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four.  See id. at 
23–24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had 
knowingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of 
New York Penal Law Section 130.55, as alleged in the Indictment).  The Court also accepted the 
Defendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York 
law.  See, e.g., Request to Charge at 19, 23, 26, 30, 31, Dkt. No. 410-1; Jury Charge at 20, 24, 
26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an 
unspecified “criminal offense”).   
The jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s 
assessment of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, Counts One and Three.  The charge explained 
that the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count 
Two.  See Jury Charge at 44–45.  In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the 
enticement of minors to travel and the transport of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage 
in sexual activity illegal under New York law.  See id.  As for the overt acts, the Court, at the 
parties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment.  Trial Tr. at 2781–82.  
Rather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts.  Jury Charge at 49–50.  For Counts One and 
Three, this included the instruction: “the Indictment alleges as follows: . . . (2) In or about 1996, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 25 of 45
A-382
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page182 of 221

when Jane was under the age of 17, Jane was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for 
purposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in violation of New York Penal 
Law, Section 130.55.”  Id. at 49. 
The Court also gave two limiting instructions to ensure that the jury’s consideration of 
certain relevant evidence was properly focused on the core of criminality.  These instructions 
pertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal 
Law Section 130.55.  The first limiting instruction pertained to Kate.  This instruction informed 
the jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of 
Kate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged.  Trial Tr. 
at 1167–68.  This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as 
explained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual 
conduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130.55, which criminalizes sexual contact 
with individuals under the age of seventeen.  See Nov. 1, 2021 Tr. at 67–68.  The second limiting 
instruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only.  The 
instruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual 
activity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the 
end of the case.  Trial Tr. at 2048–49.  This was so because, as explained, the object of the 
charged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law.  Both limiting 
instructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.  
That was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a 
minor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.  
The Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New

York.  Maxwell Reply at 5.  The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the 
jury on the core of criminality.  
Second, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled 
in the Indictment and instructed by the Court.  Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and 
Epstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in 
Florida.  Trial Tr. at 293–95, 305–06.  Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant 
when she was fourteen years old.  Id. at 315.  As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s 
testimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in 
New York.  Maxwell Br. at 13.  In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New 
York residence and the sexual acts that occurred there.  See Trial Tr. at 316–20.  She explained 
that while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took 
commercial flights.  Id. at 316.  She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these 
travel arrangements.  Id. at 316–17.  Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York 
and photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description.  See id. at 320.  
In addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with 
the Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old.  Id. at 321.  In her 
testimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that 
during the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New 
York.  See id. at 321–23.  As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states, 
including Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent.  The testimony was 
part and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s 
various properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New 
York for sexual activity illegal under New York law.  Accordingly, this particular testimony was

A-384
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page184 of 221

part of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a 
previously unidentified and independent theory of guilt.  D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 419; see also 
United States v. Jones, 847 F. App’x 28, 30 (2d Cir. 2021) (summary order) (no constructive 
amendment in sex trafficking case where indictment did not allege “advertising” but the 
evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” (cleaned up)).  
Third, the Government’s summation also reflected the core of criminality of transporting 
Jane and other underage girls to New York with the intention that sexual activity would occur in 
New York.  In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New 
York.  See Trial Tr. at 2891–92.5  The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three 
followed this pattern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and 
Epstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.”  Id. at 2895.  Thus, 
the Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s 
argument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the 
indictment,” Bastian, 770 F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, 199 F.3d at 670), but instead 
consistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.   
2. The jury note and the Court’s response did not result in a 
constructive amendment.  
The Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or 
Government’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury convicted the 
Defendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York.  See 
Maxwell Reply at 2.  She argues that the Court then erred by refusing a supplemental instruction.  
The ambiguous note and the Court’s rejection of the Defendant’s proposed responses to it did not 
In its summation regarding Count Two, which introduced the New York predicate offense to the jury, the 
Government also repeatedly emphasized that the Defendant and Epstein enticed Jane to travel to New York to be 
abused.  See Trial Tr. 2889–90.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 28 of 45

alter the fact that the evidence and instructions at trial captured the core of criminality of the 
Indictment.     
The jury note at issue read:  
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight, 
but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual 
activity, can she be found guilty under the second element? 
Court Ex. 15, Dkt. No. 593 at 23.  After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it 
was unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.  
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the 
instruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full 
instruction.  Trial Tr. at 3141.  The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction 
proposed the following day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and 
partially an erroneous statement of law.  Id. at 3148–50.  
The Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment 
to the Indictment is without merit.  First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which 
flights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on 
a 1997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida.  See 
Maxwell Br. at 14–15.  But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private 
plane and on commercial carriers.  The note did not specify which of these many flights or other 
testimony the jury was considering.  The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based 
on such a speculative foundation.   
Second, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends.  Maxwell Reply at 6.  
Rather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question 
being asked.  For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abetting liability as 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 29 of 45
A-386
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page186 of 221

to the second element.  Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New 
Mexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four.  Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different 
interpretation when the Court first read the note at trial.  Initially, the Defendant argued that the 
jury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abetting a flight 
home from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the 
“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel.  Trial Tr. at 3128–30.  It was only after a 
protracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested 
that the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New 
Mexico without any travel to New York.  On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues 
now that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s 
thinking.  Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.6  But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does 
not indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.”  Maxwell Reply at 9.  With or without the comma, 
the note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony 
being referenced, and the legal question being asked.    
The note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count 
Four.  Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that 
Count Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law.  This response ensured 
that the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state 
law at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of 
intent.  See United States v. Rommy, 506 F.3d 108, 126 (2d Cir. 2007) (“[A] trial court 
The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly 
crucial spot.  Maxwell Reply at 5, 6 n.2.  It is apparent from the Government’s brief that it relied on the trial 
transcript for its transcription of the jury note, which included a comma between these words.  See Gov. Br. at 13 
(quoting Trial Tr. at 3126).

responding to a note from a deliberating jury is only required to answer the particular inquiries 
posed.”); see also United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The trial judge is in 
the best position to sense whether the jury is able to proceed properly with its deliberations, and 
[s]he has considerable discretion in determining how to respond to communications indicating 
that the jury is experiencing confusion.”).  The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note 
following the Court’s instruction.  
By contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury.  Her 
proposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the following morning were 
erroneous.  At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant 
first proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a 
return flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”  
Trial Tr. at 3128–30.  But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question.  Id. at 
3138.  Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the principle that assistance with a return 
flight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.  See id. at 
3136.  Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the 
charge, that it direct the jury to lines 14 to 17 of Instruction No. 21, which instructed on 
“significant or motivating purpose.”  Id. at 3131.  But it was unclear that those particular lines 
addressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of 
Instruction No. 21 encompassed those lines.  
The following day, although the jury had not sought further clarification, the Defendant 
took another pass at proposing an additional response to the note.  She requested a three-
paragraph supplemental instruction that referenced elements of Counts Two and Four.  See Dkt. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 31 of 45
A-388
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page188 of 221

No. 566.7  The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special 
prominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v. Jones, 685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. 1982), and that 
complete accuracy is of “crucial importance,” United States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d 168, 172 (2d 
Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Lefkowitz, 284 F.2d 310, 314 (2d Cir. 1960)).  Portions of 
the requested instruction were unresponsive, portions were redundant, and portions were legally 
inaccurate.  The first paragraph, which pertained to Count Two, was unresponsive to the jury’s 
note that asked only about Count Four.  The second paragraph was unnecessary because it was 
redundant.  The Defendant now raises for the first time, in a footnote, that the Court should have 
sua sponte provided the jury this paragraph alone.  Maxwell Reply at 9 n.4.  But the charge as a 
whole already made clear that a violation of New York Penal Law Section 130.55 was the key 
inquiry.  See Jury Charge at 20, 23, 26, (specifying “a criminal offense under New York 
law”), 24 (Count Two instructions on New York Penal Law Section 130.55), 28 (Count Four 
referring back to these instructions), 49–50 (specifying the overt act of Jane traveling “from 
Florida to New York for purposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in 
violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55”).  Finally, the proposal also inaccurately 
stated that “sexual activity in any state other than New York cannot form the basis” of 
The requested instruction read: 
As to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the Government has proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within 
the state of New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55. 
As to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the Government has proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual 
activity within the state of New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55. 
An intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York cannot form the basis of 
these two elements of Counts Two and Four. 
Dkt. No. 566 at 7. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 32 of 45

Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page189 of 221

convictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.  
Dkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added).  Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s 
failure to propose an accurate response in either the first attempt or the second attempt a day 
later, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and 
plainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.   
The Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—
nor could she.  As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at 
issue was New York’s.  Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any 
mention of ‘travel to New York.’”  Maxwell Br. at 15.  But the Court rejected the Defendant’s 
specific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury.  For 
example, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from 
“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from 
New Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient.  See Trial Tr. at 2758–
(Charging Conference); see also United States v. Little, 828 F. App’x 34, 37–38 (2d Cir. 
2020) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements 
of the offense”).  The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law 
governing the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida.  First, the 
Defendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law.  The Court could not 
accurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of 
guilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for 
the jury.  Trial Tr. at 1712–13; Nov. 23, 2021, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 31–38.  And 
second, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious 
risk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law.  Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 33 of 45
A-390
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page190 of 221

ran the risk of moving the jury away from consideration of the core of criminality alleged in the 
Indictment.8 
The appropriate approach was to instruct the jury on the one and only predicate state 
offense for the Mann Act counts charged in the Indictment: New York Penal Law Section 
130.55.  For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge 
the limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised 
for the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to 
include an unspecified limiting instruction as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony.  Trial Tr. at 
2773–77.  During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of 
“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.”  But it was unnecessary to repeat the 
limiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.”  Id. at 2774–75.  
The jury now had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section 
130.55.  In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on 
the predicate state offense of New York law.  The jury is presumed to have followed these 
instructions.  See United States v. Joyner, 313 F.3d 40, 47 (2d Cir. 2002).  
 At bottom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that 
the jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in 
New York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in 
New Mexico.  It is hardly plausible, let alone substantially likely, that this was the jury’s 
The Defendant’s proposed instruction on other jurisdictions’ ages of consent first stated that “[t]o prove Counts 
One and Three, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent 
that the minors would engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.”  
Request to Charge at 51.  It then instructed on the ages of consent in several jurisdictions and stated that “[i]f the 
individual was at or above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdiction when the sexual activity occurred, then for 
the purposes of Counts One and Three, the sexual activity was not illegal.”  Id. at 52.  This proposed instruction 
would likely have created the confusion the Defendant raises now.

understanding.  See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 416.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that no 
constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.  
3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.  
The Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to 
transport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.9  She argues that since it is “clear” that 
the jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it 
must have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts.  Maxwell Br. at 16.  Because 
no constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing.  But even if 
the Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of 
Count Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to 
speculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three.  Moreover, it is not substantially likely that 
the jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone.  As 
described in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the 
Government presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.  
Accordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not 
be warranted as to Count Three.  
C. No prejudicial variance occurred. 
In the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the 
Indictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico.  She 
therefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction.  For purposes of this motion, the 
Court will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the 
As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court 
addresses only Count Three here.  In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were 
constructively amended are the same.  See Maxwell Br. at 16.

Indictment.  The Defendant has nevertheless failed to show that she was substantially prejudiced 
by this evidence.  See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 621.    
When a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is 
not prejudiced by a variance.  See Kaplan, 490 F.3d at 129–30.  Pretrial disclosures may put a 
defendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment.  See Khalupsky, 5 
F.4th at 294.  And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a 
continuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or 
prejudiced.  See Kaplan, 490 F.3d at 130.   
Here, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of 
Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice.  The 
Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York.  In service of this 
scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at 
various properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.  Jane had 
long recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at 16–17, although she did not report 
that Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial.  But the 
Defendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of 
substantial prejudice.  The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where 
she recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2021, more than three weeks before trial.  At 
that point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the 
Defendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice.  See, e.g., 
Nov. 23, 2021 Tr. at 28–38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the 
defendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed 
the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”).  Moreover, that the Defendant did not

request a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that 
she was not unfairly surprised.  See Kaplan, 490 F.3d at 130.  Accordingly, there is no indication 
in the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant. 
Finally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice” 
because it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.  
Maxwell Br. at 18.  For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the 
Court’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury 
improperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts.  Moreover, as explained above, the 
Defendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction 
following the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary.  While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting 
instructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been 
instructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially 
confusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge.  At that point, the charge made clear 
to the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act 
counts—not New Mexico law.  In sum, the Defendant has not shown that she suffered 
“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.     
IV. 
The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.  
Last, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions 
should be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in 
prosecuting the Defendant.  As this Court previously explained, because “the statute of 
limitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,’” the 
Defendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test.  Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 316 (quoting 
United States v. Cornielle, 171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999)).  The Defendant “must show both

A-394
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page194 of 221

that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the 
delay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.”  Id. (citing Cornielle, 171 
F.3d at 751). 
In its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement: 
there was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to 
thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from 
the Government’s delay.”  Id. at 316–17.  But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew 
her motion if the factual record at trial showed prejudice that the pretrial record did not.  The 
Defendant now renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses 
that, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay.  The Court, for the reasons 
stated below, disagrees and denies the motion. 
As an initial matter, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her 
briefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that 
the Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the 
Defendant.  United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 176 (2d Cir. 2003).  The Court has twice 
concluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these 
charges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.”  Maxwell, 2021 WL 
3591801, at *5.  It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in 
her briefing she does not attempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.  
The Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion.  If anything, as the Government notes, 
testimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the 
Defendant at an earlier time.  For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 38 of 45
A-395
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page195 of 221

the Government’s investigation was relatively recent, e.g., Trial Tr. at 354 (Jane), 1245 (Kate), 
1680–84 (Carolyn), suggesting that an earlier prosecution was not feasible.  
         Even on the first step of the inquiry, the Defendant has failed to demonstrate that she 
suffered actual and substantial prejudice from delay.  United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 CR 
541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018).  Substantial prejudice is a 
stringent standard.  The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”  
United States v. Birney, 686 F.2d 102, 105–06 (2d Cir. 1982).  Actual prejudice “is commonly 
demonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”  
Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752.  But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of 
time have been held to be insufficient.”  Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4.  And for any 
evidence lost because of delay, the Defendant “must ‘demonstrate how (the loss of evidence) is 
prejudicial’ to her.”  Birney, 686 F.2d at 106 (quoting United States v. Mays, 549 F.2d 670, 677 
(9th Cir. 1977)). 
         The Defendant identifies two major sets of lost evidence that, she says, demonstrate 
actual prejudice to her defense at trial.  First, she points to documentary evidence absent at trial: 
(1) flight records, including passenger manifests and records from Epstein’s travel agent, that 
may have been more detailed than the flight logs entered at trial; (2) financial documents, 
including bank records and credit card records, which would have revealed more about the 
Defendant’s receipt of funds from Epstein and could have been used to verify or disprove certain 
dates; (3) a complete set of the Defendant’s phone records; and (4) Epstein’s property records for 
both his New York and New Mexico residences.  Second, the Defendant identifies four deceased 
witnesses: Albert Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects that built and renovated Epstein’s residences 
in Florida, New York, and New Mexico; Sally Markham, a property manager for Epstein in the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 39 of 45
A-396
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page196 of 221

2000s that could have testified the household manual was created by “the Countess,” not the 
Defendant; and Lynn Fontanilla, a live-in housekeeper for Epstein in New York that could have 
testified about the Defendant’s and Epstein’s habits. 
         None of these identified pieces of alleged evidence satisfies the Defendant’s burden of 
proving actual and substantial prejudice.  The Court addresses first the documentary evidence.  
First, the Defendant does not attest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to 
show.  Though the Defendant would herself be best positioned to explain her own financial 
transactions (or the lack thereof), her brief does not suggest what the absent financial records 
would have shown.  Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shown in 
the absent phone records.  The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were 
missing.  At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September 
11, 2001, were far less detailed than modern manifests.  E.g., Trial Tr. at 2518–22.  The 
Defendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed.  The location 
and appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial.  The 
Defendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official 
property records. 
         Second, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the 
Defendant fails to show why the evidence, if admitted at trial, would have benefitted her case.  
The Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her: 
an absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the 
Defendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests.  But this 
presumption is purely speculative.  Each piece of evidence may very well have further 
substantiated the Government’s case.  Because the Defendant carries the burden of proof, she is 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 40 of 45
A-397
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page197 of 221

not entitled to the inference that all absent evidence would have been both favorable and material 
to her case.  United States v. Berry, No. 20-CR-84 (AJN), 2021 WL 2665585, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
June 29, 2021). 
         Third, the Defendant must show that the prejudicial loss of evidence was caused by the 
pre-indictment delay.  That is, the Defendant must show that the evidence was at one point 
available but that at trial “the lost testimony or information was not available through other 
means.”  Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d 
1037, 1041 (8th Cir. 2002)).  Here, the Defendant has made only a “bare allegation that [certain] 
records have been lost or destroyed,” but without explaining when or why they were lost.  United 
States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. 1091, 1094 (S.D.N.Y. 1973).  Further, the Defendant does not 
explain whether any attempt was made to acquire these records either directly or by other means.  
It is unexplained, for example, why the Defendant believes that government property records that 
at one point existed are no longer available.  Or why the Defendant could not have proven 
Epstein’s residency by any alternative means.  Similarly, the Defendant does not explain why the 
flight manifests that pilot Larry Visoski delivered to Epstein’s office in New York have been 
lost.  See Trial Tr. at 172.  In short, the Defendant fails to show that the absence of documentary 
evidence was causally related to any decision by the Government to delay the Indictment. 
         For similar reasons, the Defendant fails to demonstrate prejudice by reference to the 
deceased potential witnesses.  First, “[c]ourts have generally found that vague assertions that a 
deceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do not justify dismissing an 
indictment for delay.”  Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 317; see, e.g., United States v. Lovasco, 431 
U.S. 783, 785–86, 788–90 (1977) (reversing dismissal for pre-indictment delay where a material 
defense witness had died); United States v. Snyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. 1982) (two 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 41 of 45
A-398
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page198 of 221

defense witnesses died three years or more prior to indictment); United States v. King, 560 F.2d 
122, 130 (2d Cir. 1977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment).  Here, the 
Defendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.  
She states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for 
Epstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is.  Maxwell Br. 
at 29.  Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper could have testified that 
the Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his townhouse in New York but provides 
little basis or detail for that anticipated testimony.  As with the documentary evidence above, 
such speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the 
Defendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice.  See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 
651, 657 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knowing what [an absent 
witness’s] testimony would have been”). 
         Second, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony 
could not have been introduced into trial by other means.  At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein 
employed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those 
residences, or fly his private airplane.  Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David 
Rodgers, testified at trial.  Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists.  The Defendant 
does not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who 
were not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals 
who were unavailable to testify.  Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could 
provide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated.  Similarly, the Defendant does not 
explain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven 
by other witness testimony or by documentary evidence. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 42 of 45
A-399
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page199 of 221

          And third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to 
testify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense 
such that she was substantially prejudiced by their absence.  Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at 
*4.  No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually 
abused the victims.  Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the 
Defendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of 
their testimony.  This falls short of substantial prejudice.  United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 
694 (2d Cir. 1982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on 
minor points”). 
         Specifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the 
night at Epstein’s townhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts 
little, if any, of the Government’s case at trial.  Maxwell Br. at 30.  The Defendant does not 
claim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is 
unlikely to have rebutted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and 
Epstein committed crimes.  See Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4 (absence of a witness not 
prejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have 
been “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”). 
The speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual known only as “the 
Countess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the 
Defendant’s claim.  In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the 
Defendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood 
cross-examination.  See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 317 (citing United States v. Spears, 159 
F.3d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1999)).  The Defendant provides no basis to conclude that the jury 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 43 of 45
A-400
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page200 of 221

would have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence 
presented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the 
Defendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to 
create the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included.  See GX-
424. 
Finally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial 
prejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein, 
Epstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department 
Detective Joseph Recarey.  See Dkt. No. 138 at 8–11.  The Court has previously considered and 
rejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses.  Maxwell, 534 F. 
Supp. 3d at 317.  The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter 
the Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration. 
The Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment 
delay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government.  She has not 
satisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated 
that the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial 
prejudice from such delay.  The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on 
this basis. 
V. 
Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the 
jury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence 
presented at trial.  The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or 
variance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 657   Filed 04/29/22   Page 44 of 45
A-401
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page201 of 221

captured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced 
by any alleged variance.  Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its 
prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the 
Defendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay.  Finally, the Court grants the Defendant’s 
motion as to multiplicity.  The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with 
Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three.  
Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant’s participation in the same 
decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, 
to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.   
Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six.  
The Defendant’s sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022.  The Court previously set 
a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in effect.  Dkt. No. 656.  
This resolves Dkt. No. 599.

your Honor.  If the Court remembers the record evidence, there
was some evidence of money moving, but it was to buy a
helicopter that was not for her.  We heard testimony from Larry
Visoski that he often kept assets of cars in his name for
Mr. Epstein.  That doesn't make Larry Visoski a participant in
the criminal endeavors.  I think it's a stretch for the
government to point to that as some sort of evidence of
continued involvement or continued profit after the end date of
the conspiracy.  I just wanted to make that one point, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  Anything on that, Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, with respect to the financial
transaction, we offered that along with other evidence to
refute the claim that the defendant had moved on, which, as we
noted, is an expression that has no legal meaning.  And so
contrary to the assertion that the defendant had moved on and
was no longer associated with Epstein, the trial evidence
established that she remained a close associate for many years,
and that is the purpose for which we offered that evidence.
THE COURT:  Understood.  Thank you.
I do want to address -- do you have other -- I want to 
ask about 3(b)(1). 
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  I think it's for the government.  So as I
see the question here, the guidelines require me to find that
A-403
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page203 of 221

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
the defendant was an organizer or leader, and that the criminal
activity either involved five or more participants or was
otherwise extensive.  The guidelines defines a participant as a
person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the
offense but need not have been convicted.
So I think my question for the government is, you're 
asking the Court to look to as a criminally responsible -- a 
person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the 
offense over whom Ms. Maxwell exercised supervisory or 
leadership role. 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  As we noted in our
briefing, our view is that the trial evidence establishes that
the defendant had a supervisory role over Sarah Kellen.  Here,
we're not required to establish that there were five or more
participants; that is, people who were criminally responsible
for the charged conduct, but rather that it was extensive, and
that the defendant supervised at least one other person.
That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the
Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged
with that from what we can tell, but on the factual question of
the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant
supervised another participant, it absolutely does.
THE COURT:  And the government is pointing to Sarah
Kellen for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be
one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.
A-404
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page204 of 221

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Looking at the text of the
application note -- again, it's unclear from some case law on
this, but under the text of the application note, if we're
looking to one criminal participant, we would direct the
Court's attention to Sarah Kellen.
THE COURT:  And the leadership over her as opposed to
Epstein being the leader over her or them being -- Kellen sort
of replacing the defendant's role, could you focus my mind on
what specifically you point to to show supervision and
leadership by Ms. Maxwell over Ms. Kellen.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  
The trial evidence was that Sarah Kellen became an 
assistant, and that she worked for both Maxwell and Epstein.  
Essentially, when you look at defendant's role in earlier 
years, she was doing things like calling victims and arranging 
for massage appointments.  As the scheme shifted, they brought 
in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure 
and hierarchy of the scheme.  The defendant remained a close 
associate.  She was often traveling with them, often traveling 
with Kellen together.  So as Kellen took on some of the tasks 
that were then delegated to a lower member of the conspiracy, 
the defendant was higher up in the leadership structure.   
There wasn't direct evidence about, you know, the 
defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone 
call, and we acknowledge that, but we think the inference is 
A-405
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page205 of 221

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
very clear that when you have two knowing conspirators, Maxwell 
and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an 
assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the 
defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the 
structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that 
she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that 
person; that she has control.  Even the simple task of 
directing her to take on some of those responsibilities, which, 
of course, to transition parts of that role she would have to 
do would qualify for leadership. 
THE COURT:  And there's clear time overlap in the
role?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  As we noted in our brief,
the flight records reflect that the defendant continued flying
on Epstein's private jet at the same time that Sarah Kellen was
also traveling, and that there was an overlap in the years of
the time period where they were all close associates of Jeffrey
Epstein and the scheme was ongoing.
THE COURT:  Go ahead.
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes.  Your Honor, before I address the
Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the
government seems to argue that there is some case law that is
not clear that you don't have to necessarily show that they're
supervising another criminal participant.  That's just wrong.
All those cases that the government cites, the issue has
A-406
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page206 of 221

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
already been decided or conceded by the defendant.  The court
found they were leader or the defendant didn't contest that, so
the issue was only about whether the criminal activity was
otherwise extensive.  So that is not -- that is clear under
Second Circuit law, that they have to supervise another
criminal participant, and it's clear from the guidelines too,
as the government concedes.
Let's just talk a bit about Sarah Kellen.  I don't 
think it is a fair inference to say from the trial record that 
Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen.  In fact, the 
inference is exactly the opposite.  And you can rely on 
Carolyn's testimony alone for that; that she herself testified 
that there was a clear break between when she says that 
Ms. Maxwell was calling her to schedule for massage 
appointments versus when Sarah Kellen took over and scheduled 
for massage appointments.  They did not overlap.  There was a 
break.  That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said 
the same thing.  He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my 
employment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there, 
she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage 
appointments.  Again, a clear break.  
What the record shows is that there was a replacement.  
Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the 
trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing 
supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.  It couldn't be

clearer, your Honor, this notion that she was somehow -- Sarah 
Kellen was an assistant of both Epstein and Maxwell is again 
belied by the trial record.   
If you look at Larry Visoski's testimony, which I 
believe is what the government is relying on there, he 
originally testified, oh, I think she was an assistant for 
both.  But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really 
didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was 
that she was an assistant for Epstein.   
And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's 
testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she 
says unequivocally, "I was her assistant.  Kellen was Epstein's 
assistant."  So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was 
supervising Sarah Kellen.  The inference is exactly the 
opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership 
enhancement. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Anything further on the
enhancements for the government's objection?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, just very briefly with respect
to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's
attention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the
testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after
Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell
was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn
arrived for massage appointments.

With respect to the testimony of the pilots who 
testified, whether they -- whether an employee was paid by 
Maxwell or Epstein or technically reported to one, according to 
their job descriptions, is not the question here.  The fact 
that pilots based on their observation thought at one point 
that Kellen reported to Maxwell proves the point that she had 
supervisory authority over Kellen and exercised it, whether in 
the chain of command or on their formal employment paperwork, 
she was just an employee for one or the other, it makes no 
difference.  There was an overlap here.  They had different 
roles in the conspiracy, and the defendant had a supervisory 
roll over Kellen. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, just to that point.  Being
present does not mean that you're a supervisor.  That's way too
far a stretch.  So the fact that there was testimony she was
present still in the house while Kellen was making the calls
and scheduling the massage appointments means nothing in terms
of supervisory authority.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Other enhancements before the
government's objection is to be addressed.
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I assume you don't want to
hear or have any questions about the five-point enhancement for
repeated and dangerous sex offenders.

said, I don't need repetition of the arguments in the papers,
but if there is any additional points you want to make, you're
welcome to.  
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, just one point.  I will be
brief.  The government in its papers makes the argument that
the background commentary can't be relied upon as authoritative
because it is not explanatory or interpretative of what the
guideline is.  I think that is incorrect.
It is not simply a recitation of what Congress was 
considering.  That first sentence or two which talks about how 
this guideline can only be applied to offenders who represent a 
continuing danger to the community is interpretative of what 
the guideline is.  The title of the guideline is repeat and 
dangerous sex offenders.  That explanatory commentary explains 
how to interpret what dangerous means.  It means someone who is 
continuously dangerous to the community, not someone who's 
never been accused of a crime in the 18 plus years since the 
crime in this case, and has never been accused of re-offending.  
So I don't agree with that point.  This is authoritative 
guidance from the Sentencing Commission, and the Court should 
consider it as such.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, do you want to respond?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  We rest on our briefing on
this issue, but thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Anything else?

MR. EVERDELL:  No, your Honor.  We rest on the papers.
THE COURT:  I thank you counsel for your thorough
briefing.  I am prepared to rule. 
The defendant raises four objections to the 
calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR.  As we 
discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2003 guidelines 
rather than the 2004 guidelines.  Beyond that, she objects to 
the application of three sentencing enhancements.  The 
government's sole objection to the calculation of the 
guidelines is that Virginia Roberts and Melissa should be 
considered victims.  So I will address the defense objections 
and then the government's objections. 
I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals 
apply.  Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of 
the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is 
sentenced.  18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).  But the 
Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced 
under Guidelines issued after she's committed her offense and 
the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the 
version in place at the time of the offense.  That's the 
principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 530 
(2013).  In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case 
of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at 
the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must 
apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was committed.  
A-411
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page211 of 221

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••

M6SQmax1                  
United States v. Guerrero, 910 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2018).  Here, 
the parties and the probation department agree that applying 
the current Guidelines would result in a significantly longer 
sentence than the application of the guidelines in place when 
the defendant committed her offense, whether that is the 2003 
or 2004 guidelines.    
The controlling date for ex post facto purposes is the 
last date of the offense of conviction.  The 2004 Guidelines 
became effective on November 1, 2004.  So I must determine if 
the last date of the offense was after November 1, 2004.   
Because it seeks an increased punishment, the 
government bears the burden of persuasion.  The government 
charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the 
indictment alleged ended in 2004.  It's proof at trial that the 
conspiracy continued in 2004 related to Carolyn.  And the 
charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2005 
because that's when Carolyn turned 18 and can no longer be 
deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged 
which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the 
age of 18.  So the government purports to carry its burden on 
this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some 
message pads regarding what occurred in 2004 and 2005.   
Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in 
my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn 
to be a credible witness, as did the jury.  The question before 
A-412

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
me is specific and highly technical.  Does the preponderance of 
the evidence demonstrate that the offense to sex traffic 
Carolyn continued after November 1, 2004 before she turned 18 
in early 2005?  In other words, does a preponderance of the 
evidence establish that acts in furtherance of the conspiracy 
to traffic Carolyn occurred in either November or 
December 2004?  Although Carolyn testified regarding contact 
earlier in 2004 and after she turned 18 in 2005, there is no 
evidence, either in the form of testimony or documentary 
evidence, including the message pads, that demonstrates by a 
preponderance of the evidence conspiratorial conduct during 
those last two months of 2004 before Carolyn turned 18 in 2005.   
In those portions of Carolyn's testimony cited by the 
government, Carolyn stated that she was 18 years old the last 
time she went to Epstein's house, which would have been in 
2005.  As Carolyn further explained, she returned more than 
four or five times to Epstein after she gave birth to her son 
in March of 2004, and that testimony is supported by message 
pads entered at trial that show Carolyn called Epstein several 
times in the summer of 2004:  Once in late April or early May 
again on July 6, and again on July 30.  When she did return to 
Epstein, Carolyn testified Epstein asked if she had younger 
friends, and she explained during her testimony that at 18 
years old, she was too old for him.  Carolyn wasn't asked, and 
her testimony doesn't specifically address, whether she went to 
A-413
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page213 of 221

M6SQmax1                  
Epstein's house after November 2004 before she turned 18.  
Message pads entered at trial show contact only before 
November 1.   
The government's reliance on two additional pads that 
were not entered into evidence doesn't change my analysis.  The 
first message GX-4B, it's undated, and the context does not 
give sufficient confidence that it came after November 1.  The 
other message pad is dated March 1, 2005, which falls outside 
the scope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment, and 
after Carolyn turned 18.  Because I cannot on this record find 
by a preponderance of the evidence that the offense continued 
during that two-month window after November 1, 2004, and before 
early 2005, I must apply the 2003 guidelines.  Because I find 
that the date of the offense was not after November 1, 2004, I 
do not address the defendant's alternative argument that a jury 
must decide if the 2004 Guidelines apply. 
Within the Guidelines themselves, the defendant 
objects to the application of three enhancements in the PSR.  
She takes issue first with 4B1.5(b).  The enhancement 
statements that the offense level is increased by five if:  
One, the offense of conviction is a covered sex crime; two,  
4B1.5(a) for prior convictions does not apply; three, the 
defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited 
sexual conduct.  All three requirements are met:  The defendant 
was convicted of a covered sex crime; she was not previously 
A-414
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page214 of 221

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
convicted of a sex crime; and I readily find she engaged in a 
pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.  
Specifically, the Guidelines define a pattern of such activity 
as the defendant engaging in prohibited sexual conduct with a 
minor on at least two separate occasions.   
The defendant doesn't contest any of these enumerated 
requirements.  Rather, she argues that I may apply this 
enhancement only if I further find that the defendant poses a 
continuing danger to the public.  Here, the defense draws this 
requirement from background commentary by the Sentencing 
Commission and a few statements made by members of the Congress 
who of emphasized high recidivism rates in enhancing sentences 
for sex offenders.   
I overrule this objection because it lacks any basis 
in the Guidelines.  As with all interpretive matters, I start 
with the text of the Guidelines.  If the text is unambiguous, I 
apply it as written and do not resort to background commentary.  
United States v. Sash, 396 F.3d 515 (2d Cir. 2005).  Commentary 
cited by the defendant simply provides policy rationale for a 
particular enhancement.  It does not purport to interpret the 
Guidelines and so is not binding.  Nor can scattered 
legislative history override the clear text of the Guidelines, 
especially when that history amounts to only a few short floor 
statements which are "among the least illuminating forms of 
legislative history."  NLRB v. SW General, Inc. 137, S. Ct. 929 
A-415
Case 22-1426, Document 58, 02/28/2023, 3475901, Page215 of 221

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
(2017).   
Moreover, the defendant fails to prove that 4B1.5(b) 
was enacted only to prevent future danger to the public.  
Background commentary explains that aside from recidivism, 
Congress "directed the Commission to ensure lengthy 
incarceration for offenders who engage in a pattern of activity 
involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of minors."  That's 
4B1.5 comment background. 
Further, the legislative history quoted by the 
defendant says that Congress increased Guidelines sentences for 
sexual abuse of minors "to address the egregiousness of these 
crimes."  And, in fact, the defendant's brief cites that I 
believe at 12.  Thus, I find no basis for a requirement that I 
must first find the defendant to be a public danger before 
applying the enhancement.  The defendant's remaining argument 
that applying this enhancement would result in an excessive 
sentence is appropriately considered as part of the defendant's 
request for a downward variance. 
Next the defendant objects to the application 
3B1.1(a), which we've discussed, which adds four offense levels 
for her leadership role in a criminal activity.  "a court must 
make two specific factual findings before it can properly 
enhance a defendant's offense level under 3B1.1(a): (i) that 
the defendant was an organizer or leader; and (ii) that the 
criminal activity involved five or more participants or was 
A-416

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
otherwise extensive."  Quoting from United States v. Patasnik, 
F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 1996).  The Guidelines define a participant 
as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of 
the offense, but need not have been convicted.  That's Section 
3B1.1, comment note 1.  And in assessing whether criminal 
activity is extensive, all persons involved during the course 
of the entire offense are to be considered, including persons 
who provided services unknowingly.  Comment note 3.   
The defendant argues that she did not lead another 
criminal participant.  I overrule this objection because I do 
conclude that the government has proved by a preponderance that 
the defendant supervised Sarah Kellen, who was a knowing 
participant in the criminal conspiracy.   
Larry Visoski and David Rodgers both testified for 
that at least part of the time period at issue Sarah Kellen 
acted as a personal assistant to the defendant.  I credit that 
testimony which is corroborated by further testimony that the 
defendant was Epstein's number two and the lady of the house.  
At some point, Kellen took over some of the defendants duties.  
But even after that time, the defendant retained her leadership 
position, as evidenced by Carolyn's testimony, by flight 
records in evidence, and the household manual in evidence.  I 
do conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
defendant led a criminally responsible participant.   
I further find that the defendant's criminal activity

STATEMENT OF SUBJECT MATTER 
AND APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
This is an appeal from a final judgment of the District Court (Alison Julie 
Nathan and a jury), rendered on June 28, 2022, convicting Defendant-Appellant 
Ghislaine Maxwell (“Defendant”) of  Conspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent 
to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. §371; 
Transportation of a Minor with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity in 
violation of Title 18 U.S.C. §2423(a); and Sex Trafficking of a Minor in violation 
of Title 18 U.S.C. §1591(a), ( b) ( 2 ), and §2.  The trial judge imposed concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 months, respectively, to 
be followed by concurrent terms of supervised release of three years, three years, 
and five years, respectively.  The court also imposed a fine of $250,000 on each 
count for a total of $750,000. 
Timely Notice of Appeal was filed on July 7, 2022 (A420),1 pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §1291 and Fed. R. App. P. 4(b). 
Numerical references preceded by “A” are to the Appendix and by “Tr” are to the 
trial.

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 
1. Whether the District Court misapplied U.S. v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 
1985) (per curiam) to impose limits on a non-prosecution agreement contrary to 
the agreement’s plain meaning and endorsed its untenable interpretation without 
discovery or a hearing to determine the intent of the parties.  
2. Whether the District Court erred in extending the statute of limitations for 
violations of §2423(a) and §1591 under §3283 and whether the 2003 amendment 
to §3283 or §3299 applies retroactively to offenses committed before enactment of 
these statutes.  
3. Whether the court should have granted a new trial after it learned that a juror 
made materially false statements in jury selection that concealed that he had 
experienced the “exact same thing” as the victims, namely, childhood sexual 
abuse, because truthful answers given at the time of voir dire would have provided 
a valid basis for a cause challenge. 
4. Whether the District Court erred in refusing to correct the jury’s 
misunderstanding (evident from a Jury Note) under Count 4 that sexual activity in 
New Mexico violated New York Penal Law §130.55), which caused the jury to 
convict Defendant solely based on evidence of sexual activity outside of New 
York, thereby constituting a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the 
Indictment.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page17 of 113

5. Whether the District Court’s sentence was based on a miscalculation of the 
guideline range that resulted in the imposition of an upward variance in the 
absence of providing the required explanation, and whether the District Court erred 
in applying the aggravating role adjustment when there was no evidence to support 
a finding that Defendant supervised another criminal participant.  
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page18 of 113

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
By a second superseding indictment,  Indictment No.1:20-cr-00330 (AJN) 
(A114),2 filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York on March 29, 2021, Defendant was charged with the following counts: (1) 
Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts (18 U.S.C. 
§2422 and §371); (2) Enticement of a Minor to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex 
Acts (8 U.S.C. §2422 and §2); (3) Conspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent to 
Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity (18 U.S.C. 2423(a) and §371); (4) 
Transportation of a Minor with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity (18 
U.S.C. §2423(a)); (5) Sex Trafficking Conspiracy 18 U.S.C. §1591(a) and (b) and 
§ 371; (6) Sex Trafficking of a Minor in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , 
§§1591(a), ( b)(2), and 2); and two counts (7) and (8) Perjury  (18 USC §1623).3   
Defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One through Six. Defendant was 
acquitted of Count Two and convicted on the remaining counts.   
Prior to sentencing, Defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 33 after a juror revealed that he had made materially false statements in 
voir dire by which he concealed that he was a child sexual assault victim. The 
The original indictment against Ms. Maxwell, was filed on June 29, 2020, and the 
first superseding indictment, was filed on July 8, 2020. 
The perjury counts were severed prior to trial and dismissed. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page19 of 113

court conducted a hearing on March 8, 2022 (A264), after which it denied 
defendant’s motion. A318. 
On June 28, 2022, the court dismissed Counts One and Five on multiplicity 
grounds;  dismissed the severed perjury counts at the request of the Government; 
and sentenced Defendant on Counts Three, Four, and Six as described above. 
Defendant is currently serving the sentence imposed by the District Court. 
On appeal, Defendant argues, as she did below, that (1) the convictions were 
obtained in violation of a nonprosecution agreement (“NPA”); (2) all counts are 
time-barred; (3) she was deprived of her constitutional right to be tried by a fair 
and impartial jury when a juror concealed his traumatic experience as a victim of 
child sexual abuse during voir dire by providing false answers to the jury 
questionnaire on every question designed to ferret out this information; (4) the 
court’s refusal to correct the jury’s misunderstanding of an element of the 
transportation offense resulted in a constructive amendment of the indictment or a 
prejudicial variance; and (5)  her sentence was predicated upon a miscalculation of 
the guideline range and the misapplication of an aggravating role adjustment. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page20 of 113

A. The Trial 
The evidence at trial was based on the testimony of four women – Jane, 
Carolyn, Annie Farmer, and Kate.   
Jane testified that she met Epstein and Maxwell in 1994 when she was 14 
and that, shortly thereafter, Epstein began sexually abusing her.  Jane testified that 
the sexual abuse occurred in Florida, New York, and New Mexico and that 
Maxwell was in the room “more than twice.” Tr. 308-311; 340. But in interviews 
with the Government, prior to trial, Jane stated that she had no memory of 
Maxwell being present when she and Epstein engaged in sexual contact (Tr. 477) 
and that she was not sure if Maxwell had ever touched her. Tr. 475-6, 479-80.  
Carolyn testified that she gave Epstein massages that involved sexual 
contact in exchange for money in Florida between 2001 and 2004. Carolyn 
testified that in 2001 when she was 14, Virginia Giuffre, then 18, introduced her to 
Epstein. Tr. 1574-5. Maxwell would sometimes call to set up appointments and 
pay Carolyn. Maxwell saw her naked in the massage room a few times and once 
touched her breasts and buttocks. Carolyn spoke to the FBI and the AUSA-SDFL 
in 2007 and never mentioned Maxwell. Tr. 1604-5, 1620 1679. In 2008, Carolyn 
sued Epstein and Kellen for the exact same conduct she ascribed to Maxwell at 
trial, but never mentioned Maxwell in her detailed complaint. Tr. 1571, 1617.  
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page21 of 113

Kate testified that she met Maxwell in 1994 when she was 17. Tr. 1172-73, 
1236, 1253-4. Maxwell invited Kate to visit her at her home on Kinnerton Street in 
Belgravia. Tr. 1176, 1235, 1253-54, but land records show that Maxwell did not 
purchase Kinnerton Street until March 20,1997, when Kate was 20. T: 2729 -30.  
Maxwell introduced Kate to Epstein.  On two occasions, Maxwell called 
Kate and asked her to give Epstein a massage. T: 1183. In the massage room, 
Epstein took off his robe and Maxwell handed Kate massage oil and left. T: 1185. 
Epstein and Kate engaged in sexual activity during the massage. T: 1186.  
Annie Farmer testified that in 1996, when she was 16, her sister introduced 
her to Epstein in New York and that, while there, Epstein held her hand and rubbed 
her leg in a movie theater.  She also testified that a few months later she visited 
Epstein in New Mexico where she met Maxwell.  There, she claimed that Maxwell 
gave her a massage in which Maxwell massaged her pectoral muscles. Tr. 2085 
The jury was instructed that physical contact with Annie Farmer in New 
Mexico and Kate anywhere was not “illegal sexual activity,” and that Kate was not 
a victim of any charges in the indictment. Tr. 1169, 2048-49. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page22 of 113

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
1. The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has 
standing to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-
conspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the 
canon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 
1985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney 
for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”  is inapplicable here.  Id. at 672. 
But even if  the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should 
not apply here because (1) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with 
different rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are 
sufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no 
affirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and 
there were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for 
ambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing 
determines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a 
hearing on this issue. 
2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of 
limitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the 
“sexual or physical abuse…of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page23 of 113

And even if it were, the Government cannot apply the 2003 amendment to §3283 
to offenses that the Government alleges were committed before the enactment of 
this provision.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Prod., 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  Rather, such 
offenses could only have been governed by the 1994 version of §3283, pursuant to 
which the statute of limitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 and 
Defendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when the Government 
charged her in 2020.  As to §1591, Landgraf precludes retroactive application of 
either §3283 or §3299.   
3. In a trial about child sexual abuse, a juror’s material misstatements on a 
juror Questionnaire, which allowed him to conceal the fact that he was a victim of 
child sexual abuse, and his post-verdict public statements about the effect of that 
traumatic experience on his participation as a juror in this case, satisfied the two 
prong test under McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 
(1984), namely, that the juror failed to answer honestly material questions in voir 
dire and that correct responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge 
for cause. Irrespective of whether the juror’s false statements were intentional, 
which they clearly were, the similarities between the traumatic experiences 
described by the juror and the victims in the case, together with the juror’s public 
statements, established the juror’s bias.  In addition, the court unfairly limited the 
scope of the hearing. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page24 of 113

4. Under Count Four, it was necessary to prove that Defendant caused Jane to 
travel to New York with the intent that she would engage in illegal sexual activity 
that violated New York Penal Law §130.55. A juror note plainly indicated that the 
jury believed that the sexual activity intended need not have occurred in New 
York. But the court refused to correct the jurors’ misunderstanding, merely 
directing them to the charge which they had in their possession and to which they 
were already plainly referring when they asked about the “second element” of 
“count four.” Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, to which the 
Note referred, presented the jury with an alternative basis for conviction that was 
entirely distinct from the charges in the Indictment. The Court’s refusal to correct 
the jury’s obvious misunderstanding, constituted a constructive amendment and/or 
a variance from the charges in the Indictment.   
5. Defendant’s sentence was predicated on a miscalculation of the guideline 
range and the court gave no explanation for her decision to sentence Defendant 
above the range.  In addition, the court erroneously applied the aggravating role 
adjustment when there was no evidence that defendant supervised another criminal 
participant.

INTRODUCTION 
The Government prosecuted Ms. Maxwell (“Maxwell”) as a proxy for 
Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).  It did so to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular 
non-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes.   
In its zeal to pin the blame for its own incompetence and for Epstein’s crimes on 
Maxwell, the Government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell, charged 
her with time-barred offenses, resurrected and recast decades-old allegations for 
conduct previously ascribed to Epstein and other named assistants, and joined 
forces with complainants’ civil attorneys, whose interests were financial, to 
develop new allegations that would support charges against Maxwell.   
Immediately after Epstein’s death, complainants’ civil attorneys representing 
Epstein victims, including those who testified at trial, began to assist in the creation 
of the Epstein Victims Compensation Program (VCP), a non-adversarial and 
confidential claims resolution program set up to compensate self-identified victims 
of Epstein, even as they were actively involved in the Government’s investigation. 
On June 25, 2020, the Program began accepting claims.  An attorney for one 
complainant encouraged her to cooperate with the Government in its case against 
Maxwell because it would improve her prospects for receiving a larger sum of 
money from the VCP. Tr. 2731-32.  It did. “Jane” received $5,000,000.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page26 of 113

The Government announced its arrest of Maxwell on July 2, 2020, the 
anniversary of Epstein’s indictment. From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary 
confinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District 
Court denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate 
Maxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell 
was so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her 
own defense, much less to testify. 
As trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both 
scale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was 
enormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with 
its terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred.  She precluded Maxwell 
from presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that 
was central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2006 FBI investigation, the terms 
of the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil attorneys in both 
the VCP and the Government’s investigation. 
The trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane, 
Kate, and Carolyn), were permitted to testify under pseudonyms. The result 
transformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at 
every turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy 
interests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page27 of 113

That this was a manipulation designed to prejudice the jury against Maxwell was 
eloquently proven by Carolyn who wasted no time in granting an interview with 
the Daily Mail after the verdict was reached. And Kate did not even wait until after 
the verdict as she made public statements before trial.   
POINT I 
ALL COUNTS SHOULD BE DISMISSED PURSUANT TO THE  
NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT  
The Government negotiated an agreement with a criminal defendant and that 
defendant fulfilled all the conditions to the enforcement of the agreement, 
including a state guilty plea. As the Supreme Court held, “when a plea rests in any 
significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be 
said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.  
Santobello v. New York, 92 S. Ct. 495, 499 (1971).   
On September 24, 2007, the Government and Epstein entered into a 
nonprosecution agreement. The NPA immunized Maxwell as a “potential co-
conspirator.”  
A. 
The NPA 
The NPA begins with several factual recitals. The recitals state, among other 
things, that (i) the “United States Attorney’s Office” and the Federal Bureau of 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page28 of 113

Investigation (“FBI”) have “conducted their own investigation into Epstein’s 
background and any offenses that may have been committed by Epstein against the 
United States from in or around 2001 through in or around September 2007, 
including” five enumerated federal criminal offenses; (ii) Epstein seeks “to resolve 
globally his state and federal criminal liability” and thus is agreeing to comply with 
the terms of the NPA “in exchange for the benefits provided by this agreement”; 
and (iii) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the Defendant 
will be served by the following procedure.” A175 (emphasis added). Nowhere in 
the recitals is reference made specifically to the United States Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL” or “USAO-SDFL”), nor is there any 
suggestion that the parties in any way intended to limit the “global[]” resolution of 
Epstein’s liability.  
The NPA then provides that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for 
these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, 
provided that Epstein abides by” the terms of the NPA. A175. The NPA also 
provides that, after its terms are fulfilled, no prosecution for the offenses set out on 
pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement [e.g., the five enumerated federal offenses], nor 
any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page29 of 113

offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in 
this District, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.  A175.  
After detailing the terms of the agreement as they relate to Epstein, the NPA 
lays out the following provision:  
In consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide 
compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills 
all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also 
agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-
conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana 
Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.  
A178 (emphasis added).  
The NPA clearly distinguishes “the United States” from the USAO-SDFL, 
repeatedly referring explicitly to the latter where such a limitation is intended. 
Thus, the NPA’s references to the “United States” demonstrate a definitional intent 
not to limit such provisions to the USAO-SDFL. Unlike the provision that Epstein 
will not be prosecuted “in this District” (A175), the sentence regarding co-
conspirators contains no provision limiting co-conspirators’ immunity to the 
SDFL; no limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators 
of Epstein” cannot be prosecuted, and no language limiting its binding effect on 
other USAOs, as standard agreements typically do.

B. 
Appellant may enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. 
Appellant is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA, and for that reason has 
standing to enforce it.  The District Court declined to adopt the Government’s 
arguments to the contrary, and this Court should do the same. See U.S. v. Andreas, 
216 F.3d 645, 663 (7th Cir. 2000) 
Here, the NPA grants immunity to “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, 
including but not limited to [four named individuals].”  A178 (emphasis added).  
As the court recognized, this is a definable class that includes Maxwell.  A144.   
C. 
The “potential co-conspirators” provision binds the USAO-
SDNY, and Annabi is not to the contrary 
1. Introduction 
The court rejected Appellant’s attempt to enforce the NPA against the S2 
Indictment on only one ground: it found that the co-conspirator provision’s 
reference to “the United States” did not really mean the United States, but only the 
USAO-SDFL, and thus did not bind other USAOs. A189-192. But in ruling that 
the NPA did not mean what it said, the District Court ignored the plain text of the 
NPA, unsettled the parties’ objectively reasonable expectations, and misapplied 
Circuit precedent.  What is more, the court abused its discretion by endorsing this 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page31 of 113

untenable reading without even granting Defendant’s request for discovery or a 
hearing to determine the scope of the agreement.  
To support its creative reading of the NPA, the court relied on U.S. v. 
Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  That case warrants close 
attention.  In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment 
in the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and 
possessing heroin with intent to distribute.  See 771 F.2d at 671.  After they pled 
guilty to the substantive importation charge, the prosecutor represented to the court 
that “the only agreement that exists between defendants and the Government is that 
at the time of the imposition of sentence …, the Government would move to 
dismiss the two open remaining counts…”.  Id.  Accordingly, the conspiracy and 
possession counts were dismissed.  See id.  Subsequently, the defendants were 
indicted in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to distribute heroin.  
See id.  Whereas the dismissed EDNY charges had only alleged a conspiracy on or 
about a date in 1982, the new SDNY charges alleged criminal conduct extending 
from 1982 to 1985.  The defendants argued that these new charges were barred by 
their plea agreement with the USAO-EDNY.  See id.  The court conducted an 
evidentiary hearing—obtaining testimony from both the prosecutor and the defense 
attorney from the Eastern District proceedings—and concluded that the agreement 
was not meant to bind the USAO-SDNY.  See id.  The Second Circuit noted that 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page32 of 113

this result was highly counterintuitive, acknowledging that “[a] plea agreement 
whereby a federal prosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of 
an indictment…might be thought to bar the United States from reprosecuting the 
dismissed charges in any judicial district….”  Id. at 672.  Nevertheless, the Court 
declared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,” adding, “[a] plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is 
entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader 
restriction.”  Id.  The Court concluded that, because the conspiracy alleged in the 
SDNY indictment “extended for an additional two years” beyond the date of the 
conspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, “the new charges are sufficiently 
distinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule concerning construction of plea 
agreements.”  Id.  
Annabi has been sharply criticized.  One circuit said it was “unable to 
discern a sound basis for the [Annabi] rule,” adding that the decision “really has no 
analytically sound foundation.”  U.S. v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 547 (3d Cir. 2002).  
Annabi cited three prior cases from this Circuit in support of its statement that “[a] 
plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for the district 
in which the plea is entered.”  771 F.2d at 672 (citing U.S. v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d 
1065 (2d Cir. 1985); U.S. v. Alessi, 544 F.2d 1139 (2d Cir. 1976); and U.S. v. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page33 of 113

Papa, 533 F.2d 815 (2d Cir. 1976)).  But, as Gebbie explained, Annabi misread 
this Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule out of whole cloth:  
The first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely 
relies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa …  
The court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. … 
Papa, however, provides no support for the rule the Second 
Circuit follows. … Although Papa held that the plea agreement did 
not bind other districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind 
only one district, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly 
interpreted this case as meaning that plea agreements do not bind 
other 
districts 
absent 
an 
affirmative 
appearance 
of 
doing 
so. Papa does not explain or attempt to rationalize the rule that has 
evolved. 
294 F.3d at 547-48 (brackets and italics in original; bold added). 
Annabi stands in tension with what the United States Supreme Court has written 
about plea and immunity agreements.  In Santobello, 404 U.S. 257 (1971)—the 
seminal case on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s 
promise in a plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might 
have been unaware of the promise.  As Santobello explained, “[t]he staff lawyers 
in a prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘letting the left hand know what the 
right hand is doing’ or has done.”  404 U.S. at 262.  And in Giglio v. United States, 
the Supreme Court held that an Assistant United Stated Attorney (“AUSA”) had a 
duty under Brady to disclose a promise of immunity that another AUSA had made 
to a testifying witness, even though the first AUSA had been falsely assured that 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page34 of 113

no such promise was made.  See 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) (“The prosecutor’s 
office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government.  A promise 
made by one attorney must be attributed, for these purposes, to the Government”) 
(citing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 272).  These premises are inconsistent 
with the notion that a federal prosecutor in one district has no obligation to honor 
promises made by his or her counterpart in another. 
It is thus unsurprising that few courts outside of this Circuit have found 
Annabi persuasive.  Indeed, Defendant is not aware of any published authority 
from another circuit that follows Annabi in holding that an ambiguous promise 
made in a plea agreement by one USAO is presumed not to bind other USAOs.  To 
the contrary, the weight of authority holds that a representation by the United 
States Attorney’s Office or its agents will bind USAOs in other districts.  See 
Gebbie, 294 F.3d at 550 (“[W]hen a United States Attorney negotiates and 
contracts on behalf of ‘the United States’ or ‘the Government’ in a plea agreement 
… that attorney speaks for and binds all of his or her fellow United States 
Attorneys with respect to those same crimes and those same defendants.  … United 
States Attorneys should not be viewed as sovereigns of autonomous fiefdoms.”); 
U.S. v. Van Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir. 1996) (“Absent an express 
limitation, any promises made by an [AUSA] in one district will bind an [AUSA] 
in another district”); Margalli-Olvera v. I.N.S., 43 F.3d 345, 353 (8th Cir. 1994) 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page35 of 113

(“promises made by an [AUSA]” in a plea agreement “bind all agents of the 
United States government”); Thomas v. I.N.S., 35 F.3d 1332 (9th Cir. 1994)

AUSA promising that “the government” would not oppose defendant’s application 
for relief from deportation); U.S. v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 799 (1st Cir. 1988) 
(expressly declining to apply Annabi in the estoppel context, instead holding that 
“the representation of any [AUSA] may, in appropriate circumstances, be invoked 
to estop the United States…”); U.S. v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 1986) 
(“Whenever a United States Attorney negotiates and enters a plea agreement, it is 
the Government that ‘agrees’ to whatever is agreed to.”); U.S. v. Carter, 454 F.2d 
426 (4th Cir. 1972) (en banc) (vacating conviction where a plea “bargain was 
allegedly breached in a neighboring district,” adding that “[t]he United States 
government is the United States government throughout all of the states and 
districts”); Young v. U.S., 953 F.Supp.2d 1049, 1069 n.4 (D.S.D. 2013) (plea 
agreement between defendant and “the United States” in West Virginia would bind 
federal prosecutors in South Dakota); Little v. U.S., Nos. 1:08-cr-59, 1:09-cv-822, 
2010 WL 3942749, at *3 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 7, 2010) (plea agreement between 
defendant “and the United States of America,” which was “silent as to the effect it 
may have with respect to other United States Attorneys,” would be interpreted to 
“bind[] the United States Attorneys in all other districts”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page36 of 113

Annabi is also out of step with the law of this Circuit.  It is well-settled that 
“we determine whether a plea agreement has been breached by looking to the 
reasonable understanding of the parties and by resolving any ambiguities against 
the Government.”  Altro, 180 F.3d at 375; see also U.S. v. Carmichael, 216 F.3d 
224 (2d Cir. 2000) (“[W]e ‘construe plea agreements strictly against the 
Government.’”) (quoting U.S. v. Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 559 (2d Cir. 1996)).  But 
Annabi flips this formulation on its head, holding that an ambiguous promise of 
immunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding 
just one USAO rather than the Government as a whole—“unless it affirmatively 
appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”  771 F.2d at 672.  
Annabi did not explain or acknowledge its departure from this longstanding 
doctrine. 
The District Court opined that this Court “has followed [Annabi] 
steadfastly.” A190.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This Court has been 
exceedingly reluctant to affirm a conviction on the force of Annabi’s reasoning.  
So reluctant, in fact, that it has never relied on Annabi in a published decision to 
hold that a plea agreement’s reference to the “United States” or the “Government” 
was nonbinding on other districts.  Every decision from this Court that cited 
Annabi has done so essentially in dictum (as in cases involving unambiguous plea 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page37 of 113

agreements, which do not require resort to Annabi’s canon of construction),4 or for 
points unrelated to whether an agreement with one USAO will bind another,5 or—
in one case—in an unpublished decision that provided too little information to 
clarify whether the plea agreement as a whole was ambiguous.6  Annabi is an 
island of a case—without friends in other circuits, or this one. 
Annabi’s analytical faults7  counsel strongly against extending it to new facts 
or contexts.  Cf. Egbert v. Boule, 142 S.Ct. 1793, 1803 (2022) (where underlying 
See U.S. v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. Sept. 2, 2010) (agreement 
stated it was “limited to the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New 
Jersey and cannot bind other federal, state, or local authorities”); U.S. v. Ashraf, 
320 F. App’x 26, 28 (2d Cir. Apr. 6, 2009) (agreement, “by its express terms, 
bound only the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia”); U.S. v. 
Gonzales, 93 F. App’x 268, 271 (2d Cir. Mar. 24, 2004) (agreement “explicitly 
states that the agreement binds only the United States Attorney’s Office for the 
District of New Mexico”); U.S. v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 119, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) 
(“[T]his agreement is limited to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern 
District of New York and cannot bind other federal, state or local prosecuting 
authorities.”); U.S. v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986) (“[W]e need not 
resolve the question whether the Southern District is bound by this particular plea 
agreement….”); U.S. v. Persico, 774 F.2d 30 (2d Cir. 1985), aff’g 620 F.Supp. 
836, 846 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (“Persico’s plea agreement explicitly states that it ‘is 
binding on the United States only in [the Eastern] district’”) (brackets in original). 
See U.S. v. Reiter, 848 F.2d 336, 340 (2d Cir. 1988) (discussing double jeopardy 
issue); U.S. v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 916, 923 (2d Cir. 1988) (plea agreement and later 
charges arose in the same district, unlike Annabi); U.S. v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 
1294, 1321-22 (2d Cir. 1987) (case related to Annabi itself). 
See U.S. v. Brown, Nos. 99-1230(L), 99-1762, 2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. 
Apr. 26, 2002). 
Appellant preserves her argument that Annabi should be overruled or abrogated. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page38 of 113

precedent may have been doctrinally flawed, expanding it into “new…context[s]” 
would be “a disfavored judicial activity”) (quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 
1843, 1857, 1859 (2017)).  In this case, the District Court did not just purport to 
follow Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable 
territory.  In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects. 
First, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal 
district outside of the Second Circuit.  Under textbook choice-of-law rules and 
principles of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution 
canon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto 
a plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.   
Second, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea 
agreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently 
distinct” from the old ones.  771 F.2d at 672.  And Annabi made clear that charges 
are “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.  
Id.  But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct 
from 2001 through 2004 that falls entirely within the 2001-2007 offense period 
contemplated by the NPA.  Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count 
Six. 
Third, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no 
“affirmative” indication whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page39 of 113

other USAOs.  See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 671; Alessi, 544 F.2d at 1154; Papa, 533 
F.2d at 823-25.  That is not the case here; Defendant produced ample evidence that 
the NPA was intended to bind other USAOs as to possible co-conspirators.   
Fourth, at most, Annabi embraces a tiebreaking rule: after the court 
conducts an evidentiary hearing and receives testimony from the attorneys 
involved in the plea agreement, if it still cannot decide the agreement’s geographic 
scope, it may presume that it was limited to a single district.  See Annabi, 771 F.2d 
at 671; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823.  The court erred when it applied the Annabi canon 
without first granting Defendant’s reasonable request for an evidentiary hearing. 
For all of these reasons or any of them, the court’s ruling was error. 
2. Annabi does not apply because the NPA was negotiated and entered 
into outside of the Second Circuit  
Remarkably, the court applied Annabi to the NPA without conducting a 
choice-of-law analysis and without addressing Defendant’s contention that 
Eleventh Circuit law should apply.  It did so even though the NPA was negotiated 
in Florida, with Southern District of Florida prosecutors, in exchange for Epstein’s 
agreement to plead guilty in Florida state court.  As shown below, applying the 
Second Circuit’s minority Annabi rule in this context was improper and unfair: 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page40 of 113

improper because it conflicted with both federal and New York choice-of-law rules 
and unfair because it unsettled the parties’ reasonable expectations.  
As a threshold matter, none of this Court’s precedents require applying 
Annabi to agreements formed outside of this Circuit.  Although this Court has done 
so in a few unpublished decisions, these mostly involved unambiguous agreements 
which made resort to the Annabi canon unnecessary in the first place.  See Prisco, 
391 F. App’x at 921; Ashraf, 320 F. App’x at 28; Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 270; 
but see Brown, 2002 WL 34244994, at *2.   None of these decisions discussed the 
threshold question of which circuit’s law applied, and at least one magistrate judge, 
the Honorable Vera M. Scanlon, has openly questioned this line of cases.  See U.S. 
v. Bruno, Case No. 14-cr-556, 2015 WL 13731357, at *16 n.11 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 
2015) (noting that there was “a compelling argument” against applying Annabi to a 
plea agreement from outside of this Circuit), report and recommendation adopted 
in part, rejected on other grounds in part, 159 F.Supp.3d 311 (E.D.N.Y. 2016).  
Courts have held that federal plea and immunity agreements are analyzed 
under the same choice-of-law principles that apply to contracts generally.  See U.S. 
v. Lindemuth, Case No. 16-40047-01-DDC, 2017 WL 3593226, at *3 (D. Kan. 
Aug. 21, 2017) (applying Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws 
[“Restatement”] §188 to determine which jurisdiction’s law governed federal plea 
agreement); Kaplan v. C.I.R., Case No. 25652-12, 2014 WL 988456, at *8 n.14 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page41 of 113

(U.S. Tax Ct. Mar. 13, 2014) (same); U.S. v. Oruche, 257 F.Supp.2d 230, 239 n.7 
(D.D.C. 2003) (same, for federal immunity agreement); see also Samra v. Shaheen 
Bus. & Inv. Grp., Inc., 355 F.Supp.2d 483 (D.D.C. 2005) (emphasizing that, in 
“constru[ing] an immunity agreement executed during a criminal prosecution, our 
court [does] not simply adopt the contract law of the District of Columbia as a 
default,” but will instead follow “choice of law rules”).  “The Restatement 
(Second) of Conflict of Laws, to which both New York and the federal courts look, 
declares that courts will apply the laws of the state that ‘has the most significant 
relationship to the transaction and the parties.’”  John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. DRK 
Photo, 882 F.3d 394, 412 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Restatement § 188).  Here, it is 
clear that the Second Circuit is not the jurisdiction with the most significant 
relationship to the NPA, and the Government has not argued otherwise.  Instead, 
the court should have construed the NPA under Eleventh Circuit law.   
The Eleventh Circuit would hold that the NPA’s promise on behalf of “the 
United States” not to prosecute Epstein’s “potential co-conspirators” (including 
Defendant) is binding on other USAOs.  That is because, under Eleventh Circuit 
precedent, even if the reference to “the United States” were deemed ambiguous, 
the ambiguity “must be read against the government.”  U.S. v. Jefferies, 908 
F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir. 1990) (citing In re Arnett, 804 F.2d 1200, 1203 (11th 
Cir. 1986)); see also Rowe v. Griffin, 676 F.2d 524, 526 n.4 (11th Cir. 1982).  And 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page42 of 113

this result would bring the Eleventh Circuit in line with every circuit that has 
directly confronted this question (other than the Second Circuit).  See Gebbie, 294 
F.3d at 550; Van Thournout, 100 F.3d at 594; Harvey, 791 F.2d at 303.8 
Because the NPA was almost certainly negotiated with Eleventh Circuit law 
in mind, it would be unfair to impose another circuit’s minority rule of 
construction.  A plea agreement must be enforced in accordance with the parties’ 
reasonable expectations.  See Paradiso v. U.S., 689 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir. 1982) 
(“The dispositive question is what the parties to [the] plea agreement reasonably 
understood to be the terms of the agreement.”) (quoting U.S. v. Arnett, 628 F.2d 
1162, 1164 (9th Cir. 1979)).  And as this Court has observed, “[p]arties entering a 
contract will expect … that the provisions of the contract will be binding”; “[t]heir 
expectations should not be disappointed by application of [a local rule] which 
would strike down the contract or a provision thereof ….”  Eli Lilly Do Brasil, 
Ltda. v. Fed. Express Corp., 502 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Restatement § 
188 cmt b).  Here, application of Second Circuit law would render the co-
conspirator provision unenforceable—“strike [it] down”—in every federal district 
but one.  It would ambush the parties with the law of a circuit that they did not 
Alternatively, the NPA might be governed by Florida state law. It is ultimately 
irrelevant whether this Court applies Florida or Eleventh Circuit law.  Florida 
courts, like the Eleventh Circuit, would look to the weight of authority on this 
topic.  See, e.g., Brazeail v. State, 821 So.2d 364 (Fla. App. 2002) (following the 
“overwhelming weight of authority” among federal circuits on a question of 
federal law).  As noted, the weight of authority rejects Annabi.    
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page43 of 113

anticipate, disregard the NPA’s carefully-crafted text for the Government’s benefit, 
and violate settled canons within the Eleventh Circuit (and every other circuit) for 
construing such agreements.  See Jefferies, 908 F.2d at 1523; Rowe, 676 F.2d at 
526 n.4.   
The Government will likely respond that, on matters of federal common law, 
this Court should apply the lex fora without regard to regional circuit differences.  
But in criminal cases, differences in circuit law can affect the Constitution’s 
guarantees.  This principle is illustrated by the inter-circuit exclusionary rule: 
where a search or seizure is executed in one circuit but the defendant is charged in 
a different circuit, courts will look to the law of the circuit where the search or 
seizure happened to “ensure[] that the proper level of deterrence is maintained in 
the locale where the violation occurred.”  U.S. v. Restrepo, 890 F.Supp. 180, 191 
(E.D.N.Y. 1995) (Weinstein, J.); see also U.S. v. Ozuna, 129 F.Supp.2d 1345, 1354 
(S.D. Fla. 2001); U.S. v. Longo, 70 F.Supp.2d 225, 261 (W.D.N.Y. 1999); U.S. v. 
Gerena, 667 F.Supp. 911 (D. Conn. 1987).  This rule prevents the Government 
from parachuting into a new circuit and prosecuting a case it would not otherwise 
have been able to bring.  That rationale applies with equal force here.  Like the 
Fourth Amendment in the search and seizure context, the Fifth Amendment 
requires courts to hold the Government to a minimum standard of conduct in the 
plea-bargaining process.  See U.S. v. Pelletier, 898 F.2d 297, 302 (2d Cir. 1990) 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page44 of 113

(“[D]ue process requires that the government adhere to the terms of any plea 
bargain or immunity agreement it makes”); Harvey, 791 F.2d at 300 
(“[C]onstitutional and supervisory concerns require holding the Government to a 
greater degree of responsibility…for imprecisions or ambiguities in plea 
agreements”).  Thus, when the Government promises immunity on behalf of “the 
United States,” in a legal context where such promise will be construed to mean 
nationwide immunity, this Court should ensure that the Government keeps its 
promise in accordance with the law of the place where it was made.   
3. Annabi does not apply to Count Six because that count falls wholly 
within the timeframe contemplated by the NPA 
Even if Second Circuit law applied, Annabi’s rule of construction is subject 
to an important caveat: the new charges must be “sufficiently distinct” from those 
resolved by the plea “to warrant application of [the] rule.”  771 F.2d at 672.  
“[S]ufficiently distinct,” in this context, means at least partially encompassing a 
different time period.  Id.  Because Count Six relates to a timeframe wholly 
swallowed by the NPA, (A144), Annabi does not apply to that count. 
The paragraph within which Annabi articulates its “sufficiently distinct” standard 
responded to an argument by the defendants that included references to the Double 
Jeopardy Clause.  The paragraph from Annabi reads, in pertinent part (and with 
context supplied), as follows: 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page45 of 113

Even if, as appellants contend, the Southern District charges result 
from the same conspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges 
dismissed in the Eastern District, the allegation [in the Southern 
District] that the conspiracy extended for an additional two years 
suffices to show that the new charges are not identical to the 
dismissed charges.  Therefore, regardless of what degree of preclusive 
effect [under the Double Jeopardy Clause] the dismissal of the 
Eastern District charges would have if the pending charges had been 
brought by the United States Attorney for [the Eastern] District, the 
[Southern District] charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant 
application of the Abbamonte-Alessi rule concerning construction of 
plea agreements [viz., that ‘(a) plea agreement binds only the office of 
the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is 
entered….’].” 
Id. (brackets and emphases added).   
The court misread this portion of Annabi as pertaining only to “a claim 
based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based on the plea agreement[.]”. 
A191. A careful reading of the above shows that Annabi’s “sufficiently distinct” 
standard qualifies what the Court referred to as the “Abbamonte-Alessi rule,” i.e., 
the canon of construction for determining whether a plea agreement’s ambiguous 
reference to “the Government” or “the United States” includes other USAOs.  
Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672.  And under this test, it was dispositive that the later-
brought SDNY charges in Annabi alleged a conspiracy period two years longer 
than the period alleged and resolved in the Eastern District.  See id.   
What this means is that, when new charges stem from “the same” conduct 
that “underlay” charges resolved by prior plea, Annabi’s rule of construction does 
not apply unless the new charges also cover a new time period; that is what makes 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page46 of 113

them “sufficiently distinct.”  A contrary rule—allowing the Government to gainsay 
a non-prosecution promise in plea agreement by hopping to a new district and 
prosecuting the same crime, covering the same time period—would upend federal 
plea bargaining nationally, disrupt expectations beyond this case, and turn the 
Second Circuit into a forum of convenience for the Government to reprosecute 
pled-out offenses that touch multiple federal districts.  As the Fourth Circuit noted, 
prosecuting a defendant for the same charges resolved by plea agreement in a 
different district puts at stake “the honor of the government[,] public confidence in 
the fair administration of justice, and the efficient administration of justice in a 
federal scheme of government.”  Carter, 454 F.2d at 427-28.   
Here, under the “sufficiently-distinct” qualification to Annabi, the 
Government was precluded, at minimum, from charging Appellant under Count 
Six.  This count arose out of the 2006-08 SDFL investigation and is based on a 
trafficking statute, § 1591(a), that is explicitly mentioned in the NPA. A175.  The 
only accuser on whom Count Six is based, Carolyn, was also a witness in the 
SDFL investigation.  [T: 1604-5, 1614, 1679].  But unlike the SDNY charges in 
Annabi, Count Six falls wholly within the time period contemplated by the NPA as 
well.  Compare 771 F.2d at 672.  Count Six alleged that Defendant trafficked 
Carolyn from 2001 to 2004.  The court held that the NPA “cover[s] any 
involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein from 2001 to 2007, 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page47 of 113

other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office 
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury 
investigation.”  A144.  Consequently, the charge is not “sufficiently distinct,” 
Annabi does not apply, and the USAO-SDNY was bound by the NPA not to bring 
this charge.  Count Six should be dismissed. 
4. There is affirmative indication that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY 
The Annabi rule’s presumption is unavailing by its own terms where  “it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 
Annabi at 672.   
Here, the “affirmative appearance” that a broader restriction was intended 
for co-conspirators is evident within the four corners of the NPA, when the NPA is 
viewed as a whole. Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in 
written form and was carefully negotiated by sophisticated counsel. The absence of 
any limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp 
contrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is 
expressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” A175. It is difficult to envision a 
clearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion elsewhere in the 
agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here. Basic principles of 
contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered the inclusion 
of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page48 of 113

provision as to Epstein. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Nomura Asset 
Capital Corp., 424 F.3d 195, 206 (2d Cir. 2005) (“In interpreting a contract under 
New York law, ‘words and phrases ... should be given their plain meaning,’ and 
the contract ‘should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its 
provisions.’”) (citations omitted); Port Consol., Inc. v. Int’l Ins. Co. of Hannover, 
PLC, 826 F. App’x 822, 827 (11th Cir. 2020) (same under Florida law). The Justice 
Manual supports this view, admonishing prosecutors who do not wish to bind 
USAOs in other districts to “explicitly limit the scope” of the NPA to their 
districts. Justice Manual, Comment to § 9-27.630 (emphasis added). The absence 
of the phrase “in this District” from the co-conspirator immunity provision 
therefore compels the inference that the parties did not intend to so limit its reach. 
As the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to 
obtain a global resolution that would, among other things, provide maximum 
protection for any alleged co-conspirators. A175 (noting that Epstein “seeks to 
resolve globally his state and federal criminal liability”). The NPA makes clear that 
its identification of four “potential co-conspirators” by name was not intended to 
limit the immunity provision to those four individuals (“but not limited to”). A178; 
Dkt 142, Exh. H (9/16/07 email from Villafana to Lefkowitz stating that “I will 
mention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of 
the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”). The NPA on 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page49 of 113

its face immunizes assistants who worked for Epstein out of his New York office. 
For example, Leslie Groff worked for Epstein out of the New York Office. Tr. 201; 
See Doe v. Indyke et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08469-PKC, Dkt No. 1 (S.D. Fla.). 
Moreover, a promise to bind other districts need not be express; rather, it can 
be inferred from the negotiations between defendant and prosecutor, see United 
States v. Alessi, 544 F.2d 1139, 1153-54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 960, 97 
S.Ct. 384 (1976). United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986) (“A 
promise to bind other districts can be inferred from the negotiations between 
defendant and prosecutor.”) One relevant factor in this analysis is the extent to 
which the USAO negotiating the plea agreement acted on its own, as opposed to 
involving other USAOs or other offices within the Department of Justice. Cf., e.g., 
United States v. D’Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding that 
defendant “offers no meaningful support for his claim that he ‘reasonably 
understood’ the Agreement to bar subsequent prosecutions in this District. . . . He 
does not claim, for example, that the SDNY USAO was in any way consulted or 
involved in the plea negotiations.”); United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y.) (“defendants concede [] that the Central District had no knowledge 
of the investigation that was taking place in the Eastern District at the time the 
Central District plea was being negotiated. . . . The Central District, unaware of 
defendants' potential criminal liability in the Eastern District, could not have 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page50 of 113

intended to insulate defendants from prosecution which they had no reason to 
foresee.”), aff'd, 867 F.2d 1425 (2d Cir. 1988). 
Unlike standard non-prosecution agreements, the NPA here was heavily 
negotiated. Negotiations began in January 2007, lasted for a period of eight 
months, and were “extensive” and involved the Department of Justice. The parties 
exchanged several drafts of an alternative plea agreement under which Epstein 
would have pled guilty to a federal offense. See, e.g., Dkt 142, Exh. E (9/15/07 
email from Villafana to Lefkowitz attaching draft information and plea 
agreement); Dkt 142, Exh. F (draft plea agreement). Notably, those drafts of the 
plea agreement, unlike the NPA, expressly defined the term “United States” as 
limited to the United States Attorney for the SDFL.  
The Office of Professional Responsibility’s Report of the USAO-SDFL’s 
resolution of its 2006-2008 investigation of Epstein (“OPR”) (Dkt 142, Exh. A), 
reflects that negotiations involved the entire hierarchy of the USAO for the SDFL, 
all of whom signed off on the NPA. Senior levels of Main Justice were directly 
involved in the negotiation and approval of the NPA, even to the extent that 
separate presentations regarding the NPA were made to, and approval of the NPA 
was obtained from, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. Further, the NPA 
itself reflects the involvement of the FBI. A174; Dkt 142, Exh. A at 1-2, 94-97, 
103-18. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page51 of 113

Moreover, the USAO-SDFL’s involvement of the USAO for this District in 
its investigation of Epstein, as well its contact with witnesses in New York, reflect 
a coordinated effort that transcended the USAO-SDFL (Dkt 142, Exh. A at 46, 48, 
60). From these facts, it affirmatively appears that the Government had every 
reason to foresee a potential prosecution of Epstein’s co-conspirators in this 
District and, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice, 
intended to agree to preclude it.  According to the OPR, the NPA originally read 
that it “resolves the federal criminal liability of the defendant and any co-
conspirators in the Southern District of Florida…”, but this language was modified 
and the final agreement was not so restricted as to the co-conspirators. Dkt 142, 
Exh. A at 74-75.  
The OPR demonstrates the trans-district scope of the investigation and the 
negotiations. 
• Dkt 142, Exh A at 27 n.38 (Feds considered arresting Epstein in the 
Virgin Islands, rather than Florida, indicating national scope of 
investigation);  
• Id. at 46 (“[I]nvestigators had learned that Epstein used hidden cameras 
in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters”);  
• Id. at 58 (AUSA Villafana requested “enough time to go to New York, 
pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s assistants, do 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page52 of 113

witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s 
computers if Epstein rejected the deal.”) 
• Id. at 60 (“Villafana…reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s 
assistants in New York and to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues 
and former employees there”). 
• Id. at 68 (Feds considered charging Epstein under 18 USC 113(a)(5), 
simple assault on an airplane, indicating possible bases to charge him in 
other districts). 
• Id. at 69, 73, 75, 79-80 (Defense sought a government promise not to 
bring immigration proceedings against Epstein’s assistants). 
The NPA and the OPR provide ample evidence that the agreement as to the 
co-conspirators was intended to bind other districts. In contrast, in Annabi, 
Abbamonte, Alessi, and Papa, there was a complete absence of any evidence 
showing an intent to bind other districts.    
5. If it is reasonable to conduct a hearing, then Annabi is a tiebreaker 
that only applies if ambiguity remains after the hearing 
 The language of the NPA and the evidence contained in the OPR are more 
than sufficient for the Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Maxwell, 
particularly when any ambiguities are construed, as they must be, against the 
Government as drafter.  In the alternative, however, the NPA and the 
circumstances of its execution merit discovery and an evidentiary hearing 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page53 of 113

regarding the parties’ intent. To the extent that extrinsic materials do not make the 
parties’ intent clear, the Court is obligated to make a finding as to the parties’ 
“reasonable understanding,” with ambiguities resolved in Maxwell’s favor. See 
United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268 at 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (emphasis and 
citation omitted).  
Courts in this circuit have routinely recognized the need for evidentiary 
hearings where the existence or scope of such agreements is in genuine dispute. 
See, e.g., id. at 270 (noting testimony from defendant’s attorney); United States v. 
Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 91 (2d Cir. 2002) Annabi, 771 F.2d at 671 (noting that 
district court heard testimony from two prosecutors, defendant, and defendant’s 
counsel as of the time the plea agreement was reached); United States v. Papa, 533 
F.2d 815, 820 (2d Cir. 1975) (describing “two evidentiary hearings”); United 
States v. Sattar, 2003 WL 22510398, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2003) (noting 
conclusion that “an evidentiary hearing was warranted . . . to determine whether an 
agreement existed, what its terms were, and whether there was compliance with 
those terms”).   
At a minimum, a hearing should have been held here, as was the case in 
Annabi, itself, and Papa to ascertain the parties’ intent. It is submitted that such a 
hearing would have established that Epstein intended tat any co-conspirators would 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page54 of 113

have total immunity from federal prosecution for matters that were the subject of 
the investigation. 
D. 
 All counts fall within the scope of the NPA and must be 
dismissed. 
Given that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY, all three remaining counts 
must be dismissed because the plain text of the co-conspirator provision is not 
limited to any particular offense or any time period. A172. 
That the co-conspirator immunity provision is not limited to the 2006-2007 
investigation or the 2001-2007 timeframe or to prosecution in the SDFL is 
reinforced by another provision of the agreement which reads, in pertinent part, 
that a breach of the agreement, “allows the United States to elect to terminate the 
agreement and to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or 
entity for any and all federal offenses. A172.  
In any, event, at minimum, Counts Three and Six must be dismissed because 
they indisputably fall within the scope of the NPA even as construed by the 
District Court.  
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page55 of 113

POINT II 
ALL COUNTS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS 
For noncapital offenses such as those with which Appellant was charged, the 
statute of limitations is five years. 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a).  It is undisputed that a 5-
year limitations period would bar all charges brought against Defendant.    
To escape the consequences of its delay in bringing these charges, the 
Government hangs its hat on 18 U.S.C. § 3283.  Section 3283 is a narrow 
exception to the statute of limitations, but its application can expose a person to 
criminal prosecution during the lifetime of anyone who accuses him or her of child 
abuse or kidnapping.  To guard against overreach, it is important to recall the well-
settled “principle that criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted in 
favor of repose.”  Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115 (quoting U.S. v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518 
(1926)).  Indeed, the Government’s and District Court’s capacious reading of 
§3283 would have wide-ranging ramifications in this Circuit—beyond Maxwell’s 
case—if blessed by this Court.   
Section 3283 provides that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise 
preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or 
kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution 
during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”  
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page56 of 113

U.S.C. § 3283.  Congress enacted the predecessor to this provision under the 
Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub.L. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4789, and codified it as § 
3283 under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. 
103-322, 108 Stat. 1796, commonly known as the “1994 Crime Bill.”  As 
promulgated in the 1994 Crime Bill, this section provided that the statute of 
limitations for an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse of a child” would 
expire once the alleged victim “reaches the age of 25 years.”   108 Stat. 2149.  But 
it was not until 2003 that Congress amended § 3283 to provide for a limitations 
period running for the entire life of the alleged victim.  See PROTECT Act, Pub.L. 
108-21, § 220, 117 Stat. 650, 660.9  The PROTECT Act was signed into law on 
April 30, 2003.   
Contrary to what the Government argued below and what the District Court 
held, §3283 cannot salvage Counts Three and Four for two separate and 
independent reasons.  First, §3283 does not extend the statute of limitations for 
violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the “sexual or 
physical abuse…of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.  Second, 
the Government cannot apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283—the statute of 
limitations for the lifetime of one’s accuser—to offenses that the Government 
alleges were committed before the enactment of this provision.  See Landgraf v. 
Congress amended § 3283 again in 2006.  The Government does not contend that 
that amendment is relevant here. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page57 of 113

USI Film Prod., 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  Rather, such offenses could only have been 
governed by the 1994 version of § 3283, pursuant to which the statute of 
limitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 years old.  And it is 
undisputed that Defendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when 
the Government charged her in 2020.   
For these reasons, Appellant’s convictions under Counts Three and Four 
must be vacated.  
A. Section 3283 Does Not Apply to the Mann Act Violations (Counts Three 
and Four) 
Under Counts Three and Four, the Government charged Defendant with 
substantive and conspiracy violations of the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), more 
than 15 years after the fact.  To accomplish this, the Government relies on § 3283’s 
extension of the limitations period.  But by its text, § 3283 applies only to 
“offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.”  18 
U.S.C. § 3283.  Transportation of a minor or conspiracy to transport in violation of 
§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed. 
At first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and 
Four do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual … abuse … of a child.”  But 
longstanding legal precedent dictates a narrower application of § 3283.  The 
Supreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “essential 
ingredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page58 of 113

crimes.  Under this approach, a court “look[s] to the statute defining the crime of 
conviction, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.”  Kawashima v. 
Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 483 (2012); see also U.S. v. Taylor, 142 S.Ct. 2015, 2020 
(2022) (the categorical approach asks only what the Government is required “to 
prove—beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case,” and “precludes…an 
inquiry into how any particular defendant may commit the crime”).   
Here, applying the categorical approach to § 3283 means holding that this 
provision is inapplicable here.  That is because “sexual or physical abuse, or 
kidnaping, of a child” is not a required element of transporting minors in violation 
of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same.  18 U.S.C. § 2423(a).  The offense is 
accomplished once a person “transports” a minor with the requisite knowledge and 
intent; “[t]he government need not prove … that the unlawful sexual activity 
actually took place.” U.S. v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2013).  
Thus, Counts Three and Four should have been dismissed.   
However, to save Counts Three and Four from dismissal, the court rejected 
this categorical approach altogether and opted instead for a “case-specific” one, 
which would permit it to examine whether this particular defendant’s alleged 
conduct “involve[ed] the sexual or physical abuse…of a child.”  In so doing, the 
court brushed aside the clear weight of authority, which holds that statutes 
employing “offense…involves” or “offense…involving” language identical to § 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page59 of 113

3283 should be read through a categorical rather than case-specific lens.  See U.S. 
v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)); Kawashima, 
565 U.S. at 483 (interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i)); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 
543 U.S. 1, 7 (2004) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 16(b)); U.S. v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 
192, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a)).   
Indeed, the Supreme Court has—on multiple occasions—firmly held that a 
categorical approach must be employed to interpret statutes of limitation that bear 
striking resemblance to §3283.  For instance, the Supreme Court has held that a 
proviso of the internal revenue laws, extending from three to six years the statute 
of limitations for prosecuting “offenses involving defrauding or attempting to 
defraud the United States,” applies only when “defrauding or an attempt to defraud 
the United States is an ingredient under the statute defining the offense.”  U.S. v 
Noveck, 271 U.S. 201, 202-203, 204 (1926) (emphasis added) (quoting Act of 
November 17, 1921, c. 124, 42 Stat. 220, codified in its present version at 26 
U.S.C. § 6531).  Noveck held that this provision did not extend the statute of 
limitations for perjury, because fraud is not a required element of that crime.  Id.; 
see also Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522 (same, with respect to tax evasion).  Indeed, 
Noveck found this statute inapplicable even when the indictment specifically 
alleges fraud, because such fraud allegations are “mere surplusage,” not an 
element of the offense.  271 U.S. at 203.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page60 of 113

Similarly, in Bridges v. U.S., 346 U.S. 209 (1953), the Court applied a 
categorical approach to the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA), 
which provided, in pertinent part, that “[w]hen the United States is at war the 
running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense … involving fraud or 
attempted fraud against the United States … shall be suspended….”  Act of June 
25, 1948, c. 546, 62 Stat. 828 (emphasis added) (codified in its present version at 
U.S.C. § 3287).  The Government charged Bridges with willfully making a false 
statement, to wit, denying membership in the Communist Party, in connection with 
his 1945 naturalization application.  Invoking the WSLA, the Government argued 
that the charges were timely.  But the Supreme Court, recalling Noveck and 
Scharton, held that the WSLA was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding 
or attempting to defraud the United States is an essential ingredient of the offense 
charged.”  Id. at 221 (emphasis added).   
In this case, the court made no attempt to distinguish Scharton or Noveck.  
And though it purported to distinguish Bridges, it blatantly mischaracterized the 
Supreme Court’s opinion, asserting that Bridges applied a categorical approach “in 
large part” because of the WSLA’s legislative history. A149.  The District Court’s 
statement was wrong.  Bridges’ passing reference to legislative history concerned a 
different issue: whether the kind of “fraud” contemplated by the WSLA had to be 
fraud “of a pecuniary nature.”  346 U.S. at 216.  But the Court then stated, as an 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page61 of 113

alternative holding — “[a] further ground for [its] conclusion” —that, even in 
cases where “fraud” occurs, a categorical analysis precludes extending the WSLA 
to prosecutions for making false statements.  Id. at 221-22.  And in applying this 
categorical approach, Bridges looked, not to the legislative history of the WSLA, 
but to Scharton and Noveck (which involved a different statute).  See Bridges, 346 
U.S. at 222 (citing, inter alia, Scharton and Noveck). 
Here, Bridges, Scharton, and Noveck point the way.  Because § 3283 
employs the same “offense-involving” language as the statutes analyzed in those 
cases, compare 18 U.S.C. § 3283 with id. § 3287; 26 U.S.C. § 6531, a similar 
interpretation should govern.  See Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228, 
233 (2005); Wasser v. New York State Off. of Vocational & Educational Servs., 
602 F.3d 476, 480 (2d Cir. 2010).  The Court should apply a categorical approach 
and hold that § 3283 did not modify the statute of limitations for § 2423(a) 
violations. 
Nothing in the text of § 3283 indicates a contrary result.  Indeed, Congress 
has shown that when it wants to tether a statute of limitations to conduct occurring 
in a particular case, it knows how to do so—and uses unambiguous wording 
distinct from § 3283.  Notably, in 2001, Congress eliminated the statute of 
limitations for certain terrorism offenses in which “the commission of such offense 
resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page62 of 113

another person.”  see U.S. v. Pham, No. 12-cr-423, 2022 WL 993119, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2022) (Nathan, J.) (“§3286(b)’s use of the terms ‘foreseeable’ 
and ‘commission of such offense’ … dictate a case-specific approach.”).   
It is noteworthy that the District Court could not identify a single page of 
legislative history supporting its expansive interpretation of § 3283.  But that did 
not deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when 
Congress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general intention to cast 
a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.”  A144.  This 
questionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v. 
Schneider, 801 F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015), which itself quotes an Eleventh 
Circuit case, United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010).   
Dodge, however, had nothing to do with § 3283.  Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex 
Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a completely different 
statute passed years after the relevant amendment to § 3283.  Worse still, the full 
quote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s text, not its legislative history.  
See Dodge, 597 F.3d at 1355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our 
conclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against 
children as possible.”) (emphasis added).  Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by 
extension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative 
history for § 3283 that does not exist. If anything, § 3283’s legislative history 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page63 of 113

corroborates Defendant’s interpretation.  The Joint Report accompanying the 2003 
amendment to this provision opined that the prior statute of limitations would not 
go far enough to allow the Government to prosecute “a person who abducted and 
raped a child.”  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, at 54 (2003).  This legislative history 
makes no mention of crimes, such as Mann Act violations, that do not categorically 
involve the actual abuse of minors. 
Rather than grounding its construction of § 3283 in the text or legislative 
history of the statute, the District Court relied almost exclusively on an inapposite 
decision from this Court, Weingarten v. U.S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2017).  The 
District Court conceded, as it had to, that Weingarten is not controlling (A147), but 
it essentially and erroneously treated Weingarten as though it were.  The only 
question in Weingarten was whether the petitioner’s trial counsel provided 
constitutionally deficient representation by conceding that an indictment charging 
Mann Act violations was timely.  See 865 F.3d at 52.  The petitioner contended 
that his trial counsel should have argued that § 3283 must be interpreted under a 
categorical standard.  See id. at 58.  This Court disagreed only because “[i]t was 
not obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a 
court must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to 
determine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.”  Id. at 58-59 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page64 of 113

(emphasis added).  Weingarten does not move the needle because it did not purport 
to decide how § 3283 should actually be construed.   
The District Court’s reliance on Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2009), a 
case interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), was likewise misplaced.  The 
District Court cited Nijhawan for the proposition that “the word ‘involves’ 
generally means courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as 
committed in each case.” A148.  But Nijhawan says otherwise; there, the Supreme 
Court reaffirmed its prior case law holding that statutory “language, covering 
‘crime[s]’ that ‘involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical 
injury to another’ … refers to crimes as generically defined.”  557 U.S. at 36 
(emphasis and brackets in original) (quoting James v. U.S., 550 U.S. 192, 202 
(2007)).10  Indeed, the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the clause, “offense 
that … involves fraud or deceit,” as used in § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), is analyzed 
categorically, directly contrary to the District Court’s apparent misreading of 
Nijhawan.  Compare Kawashima, 565 U.S. at 483 (“employ[ing] a categorical 
approach”) with A148. 
This Court should decline to ratify the District Court’s case-specific 
approach for an additional reason: it would conflict with at least two other circuits 
that have examined § 3283 and concluded that a categorical approach applies.  See 
In Johnson v. U.S., the Supreme Court overruled James on other grounds, but 
expressly reaffirmed James’ categorical approach.  See 576 U.S. 591, 604 (2015).  
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page65 of 113

U.S. v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2015) (Graves, J.); U.S. v. Coutentos, 651 
F.3d 809 (8th Cir. 2011).  In Coutentos, a jury found the defendant guilty on two 
counts: sexual exploitation or attempted sexual exploitation of a minor to produce 
child pornography (18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) and (d)) and possession or attempted 
possession of child pornography (18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)).  Both 
counts were untimely unless § 3283 applied.  As the Court’s recitation of the facts 
made clear, the production and possession counts were based on the same 
underlying conduct: the defendant’s abuse of his granddaughters to create child 
pornography.  See Coutentos, 651 F.3d at 813-14.  Thus, in a factual sense, the 
defendant’s possession clearly involved the sexual abuse of a child.  Nevertheless, 
the Eighth Circuit, while affirming the production conviction, vacated the 
possession conviction on the ground that it was not an “offense involving the 
sexual…abuse of a child” within the precise meaning of § 3283.  The Court 
considered the possession statute in the abstract, asked whether it necessarily 
required proof of involvement in the sexual abuse of a child, and concluded that it 
does not: 
Does someone who merely possesses child pornography sexually 
abuse the child portrayed in the images? No more than the offense of 
possessing methamphetamine involves the act of producing it, does 
the offense of child pornography involve the sexual abuse of a child.  
That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the time of the 
abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing 
child pornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page66 of 113

the sexual abuse of a child.  Thus, we conclude that § 3283 is 
inapplicable…. 
Id. at 817. 
In Diehl, the Fifth Circuit has similarly interpreted § 3283 through a 
categorical lens.  The defendant was convicted of producing child pornography 
under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a).  To determine whether the defendant’s offenses were 
“offense[s] involving the sexual…abuse of a child” under § 3283, the Court looked 
not to the facts of the case but, rather, “the language of the relevant statutes.”  
Diehl, 775 F.3d at 720.  The Court expressly cited Coutentos and held that § 
2251(a) was an “offense involving the sexual … abuse of a child,” as the statute 
“prohibits using or inducing children under the age of 18 to engage in sexually 
explicit conduct for the purpose of creating a visual depiction.”  Id. (citing 
Coutentos, 651 F.3d at 816-17).     
B. The District Court erred in applying § 3283 retroactively 
Even if the District Court were correct to afford § 3283 a case-specific rather 
than categorical construction (and it was not), it erred again when it held that the 
April 30, 2003 amendment to that provision—extending the statute of limitations 
for the life of the accuser—reached back to attach to conduct occurring before its 
enactment.  Contrary to what the District Court held, the 2003 amendment was not 
retroactive.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page67 of 113

Pursuant to Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994), courts 
must follow a two-step framework to assess whether an act of Congress may be 
interpreted to apply retroactively.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 
280 (1994); see also Enterprise Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Securities Litig. v. 
Enterprise Mortg. Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 405-406 (2d Cir. 2004).  “At the 
first stage, a court must ‘determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the 
statute’s proper reach.’  If Congress has done so, the inquiry ends[.]”. Enterprise, 
391 F.3d at 405-406 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280).  If, however, “the statute 
is ambiguous or contains no express command, the court proceeds to the second 
stage of the Landgraf test and ‘determine[s] whether the new statute would have 
retroactive effect[.]’” Id. (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280).  “If the statute, as 
applied, would have such an effect, it will not be applied retroactively ‘absent clear 
congressional intent’ to the contrary.”  Id. (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280). 
To apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 retroactively, the Government must 
clear both hurdles of the Landgraf analysis.  In fact, it cannot clear either of them.  
At step one, Congress clearly evinced an intent that the 2003 amendment operate 
only prospectively.  Alternatively, at step two, the amendment would have an 
impermissible retroactive effect. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page68 of 113

1. Congress evinced an intent that § 3283 operate only prospectively 
The first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the 
temporal reach of the 2003 amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” 
that the 2003 Amendment was to apply prospectively only.  
To begin with, the text of the 2003 amendment omits any mention of 
retroactivity.  If anything, it points in the opposite direction.  This section twice 
employs forward-looking modal verbs: “would” and “shall.”  See 18 U.S.C. 3283 
(“No statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an 
offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the 
age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for 
ten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”); see also Appalachian Power Co. 
v. E.P.A., 249 F.3d 1032, 1057 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (characterizing the phrase “would 
emit” as a “future conditional phrase”); Salahuddin v. Mead, 174 F.3d 271, 275 (2d 
Cir. 1999) (“There is no doubt that ‘shall’ is an imperative, but it is equally clear 
that it is an imperative that speaks to future conduct”); Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 
U.S. 304, 314 (1816) (“The word shall, is a sign of the future tense….”).  This 
language indicates that § 3283 looks into the future, not the past. 
Even if the text of § 3283 were unclear about its temporal reach, we would 
not proceed immediately to step two of Landgraf.  Instead, courts must also 
“examin[e] legislative history to determine congressional intent at the first stage of 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page69 of 113

the Landgraf test.” Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 408 (citing Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 262-
63); see also Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (1999); Lattab v. Ashcroft, 
384 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2004). 
The legislative history of 2003’s amendment makes it abundantly clear that 
Congress considered—and rejected—a retroactivity clause that would have 
expressly allowed § 3283’s lifetime limitations period to attach to conduct 
predating its enactment.  The House version of the bill included the following 
proviso: 
The amendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution 
of any offense committed before, on, or after the date of the enactment 
of this section. 
Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. 1104, 108th Cong. § 202 (2003).  When the 
House and Senate conferenced, however, this retroactivity provision was rejected.  
Courts give great weight to Congress’ consideration and rejection of a legislative 
proposal in interpreting federal statutes, and such a clear expression of 
congressional intent ought to end the Landgraf analysis at step one here.  See Food 
& Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 144 
(2000); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 
464 U.S. 89, 104 (1983); Hudson Valley Black Press v. I.R.S., 409 F.3d 106, 112 
(2d Cir. 2005); United States v. Napolitano, 761 F.2d 135, 137 (2d Cir. 1985); 
United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 693 (2d Cir. 1982). 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page70 of 113

Although the District Court was correct to recognize that Congress deleted 
the retroactivity provision purposefully, it failed to understand the reason.  The 
District Court relied on a floor statement by Senator Leahy, in which the Senator 
offered his own reasons for opposing the retroactivity clause: 
I am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the 
original House-passed bill that would have extended the limitations 
period retroactively. That language, which would have revived the 
government’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-
barred, is of doubtful constitutionality.  
149 Cong. Rec. S5147.  Based on this, the District Court theorized that Congress 
wanted only to ensure that the extended statute of limitations would not 
unconstitutionally revive time-barred claims.  See Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 
607, 610 (2003). 
But Stogner is an unilluminating lens through which to analyze Sen. Leahy’s 
remark, as that case was not decided until after the PROTECT Act was passed.  
And though Stogner established, for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes, a clear 
division between statutes that revive time-barred prosecutions and those that 
merely extend the time to bring prosecutions not time-barred, this dichotomy 
would not have been apparent to Congress before Stogner. Indeed, the Stogner 
majority felt it necessary to clarify that its holding did “not prevent the State from 
extending time limits…for prosecutions not yet time barred,” 539 U.S. at 632, 
while the dissent contended that this dichotomy was untenable, see id. at 650 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page71 of 113

(Kennedy, J., dissenting).   Congress could not have known which point of view 
would carry the day; Sen. Leahy may very well have thought that any retroactive 
application of the statute would be of doubtful constitutionality. 
In any event, Sen. Leahy’s remark confirms that Congress’s rejection of the 
provision was intentional—that it did not merely “agree to disagree,” as in 
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 623—his reasons why the provision was rejected cannot be 
ascribed to other members of Congress.  See Garcia v. U.S., 469 U.S. 70, 76 
(1984) (noting floor statements by a single member are generally weak legislative 
history evidence).  Indeed, we know that when Congress rejected the retroactivity 
provision in the 2003 House bill it almost certainly did not do so for constitutional-
avoidance reasons.  We know this because other criminal statutes of limitation 
passed by Congress contained language identical to the retroactivity provision that 
Congress rejected in the 2003 amendment to § 3283.  See Pub.L. 107-56, § 809, 
115 Stat. 272 (Oct. 26, 2001) (note to 18 U.S.C. § 3286) (“The amendments made 
by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense committed before, on, 
or after the date of the enactment of this section.”); Pub.L. 101-647, § 2505, 104 
Stat. 4789 (Nov. 29, 1990) (note to 18 U.S.C. § 3293) (similar).   
For these reasons, applying § 3283 retroactively fails under step one of 
Landgraf. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page72 of 113

2. The District Court’s application of § 3283 creates “impermissible 
retroactive effects” without authorization from Congress 
Even if the text and legislative history of § 3283 were unclear, Landgraf’s 
“presumption against statutory retroactivity” would foreclose retroactive operation 
of this statute at step two.  511 U.S. at 293.  Because “retroactive application 
[must] be avoided ‘absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result,’” 
which is lacking here, the District Court’s retroactive application of § 3283 must 
be reversed.  Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 410 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280). 
Were this Court to hold otherwise, it would stand in conflict with the Third 
Circuit.  In U.S. v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1975), the Third Circuit 
rejected the retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations, citing both a 
general presumption against retroactivity similar to what the Supreme Court would 
later echo in Landgraf, and the more specific canon in favor of repose articulated 
in Toussie.  See Richardson, 512 F.2d at 106.   
Although Richardson was decided before Landgraf, courts continue to 
follow its holding that criminal statutes of limitations are presumed not to apply 
retroactively, even as to conduct that fell within the limitations period and could 
have been prosecuted at the time of enactment.  See U.S. v. Gentile, 235 F.Supp.3d 
at 655-56 (holding that expansion of securities fraud statute of limitations did not 
apply retrospectively although the limitations period in his case had not yet expired 
when statute was expanded); U.S. v. Schneider, C.A. No. 10-29, 2010 WL 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page73 of 113

3656027, at *1 & n.1 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2010) (agreeing with Government’s 
concession that the Adam Walsh Child Protection Act, Pub.L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 
587 (Jul. 27, 2006) (codified in relevant part at § 3299), which abolished the statute 
of limitations for certain offenses against minors, did not apply retroactively to 
allow prosecution of defendant under the Mann Act, even though the prior five-
year statute of limitations had not yet expired). 
Judge Rakoff in this circuit observed that an expansion of a statute of 
limitation is “retroactive” if it applies to past conduct, even when it merely extends 
the time to bring an action that is not yet time-barred.  Morales v. Irizarry, 976 
F.Supp. 256, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (citing Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 279) (“In the 
absence of some such legislative indication, such a retroactive expansion of a 
substantive provision like the statute of limitations will not be presumed”). 
Morales was a civil case.  But Landgraf’s “presumption against retroactive 
legislation,” which “is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,” 511 U.S. at 265, 
applies with even stronger force in the criminal context.  Unlike civil statutes, 
“criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of respose.’”  
Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522).  See U.S. v. Gentile, 
235 F.Supp.3d 649, 655 (D.N.J. 2017).  Consequently, the extension of a criminal 
statute of limitations will not apply to pre-enactment conduct unless Congress has 
clearly stated that it should.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page74 of 113

The Government argued that there is no Ex Post Facto violation in applying 
§ 3283 retroactively to Appellant’s pre-April 30, 2003 conduct.  We agree.  See 
Stogner, 539 U.S. at 632.  But the Government’s reliance on Ex Post Facto 
principles is misdirection.  As Richardson, Gentile, and Schneider illustrate, the Ex 
Post Facto Clause is not the final word on whether a statute is impermissibly 
retroactive.  Indeed, the entire premise of Landgraf is that certain statutes must be 
presumed (absent a clear statement from Congress) to apply only prospectively, 
even though retroactive application would be entirely constitutional: 
But while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil 
legislation are now modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate 
default rule.  Because it accords with widely held intuitions about 
how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity 
will 
generally 
coincide 
with 
legislative 
and 
public 
expectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has 
affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive 
application and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay 
for the countervailing benefits. 
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 272-73 (emphasis in original; bold added). 11  This view was 
echoed by no less a jurist than Judge Calabresi, who opined that “[Landgraf’s] 
anti-retroactivity presumption is triggered by statutes whose retroactive 
application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto, nevertheless would 
Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a civil 
case.  Non-criminal statutes, like criminal statutes, can be unconstitutionally 
retroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clauses), but the constitutional 
standard is different from the Landgraf test.  See E. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 
498 (1998).   Conversely, some criminal statutes are presumed not to apply 
retroactively even though doing so would be perfectly constitutional. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page75 of 113

run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled 
expectations.’”  Thom v. Ashcroft, 369 F.3d 158, 163 n.6 (2d Cir. 2004) (Calabresi, 
J., majority opinion but “[s]peaking only for [him]self”) (quoting Landgraf, 511 
U.S. at 270).   
The authority cited by the District Court is not to the contrary.  In Vernon v. 
Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist. 49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. 1995), a civil case, the 
Court concluded that an amendment to a statute of limitations applied retroactively 
because it was procedural. id. at 891, But in Enterprise, Judge Cabranes—writing 
for a unanimous Court—retreated altogether from Vernon’s prior characterization 
of statutes of limitations as purely “procedural.”  As Judge Cabranes wrote, Vernon 
“did not create a categorical exception [for statutes of limitations] from Landgraf’s 
presumption against retroactive application of legislation.”  391 F.3d at 409.  Most 
importantly for this case, Enterprise indicated that an extension of the statute of 
limitations may operate with impermissible retroactive effect when it applies to 
pre-enactment conduct, regardless of whether or not it revives claims that are 
altogether time-barred.  See id. at 410. 
Finally, The District Court also relied on decisions from the Eighth and 
Ninth Circuits, which—in tension with the Third Circuit’s reasoning in 
Richardson,—concluded that §3283 can be applied retroactively.  See U.S. v. Leo 
Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 2006); U.S. v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682 (8th Cir. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page76 of 113

2005).  But neither decision cited Landgraf; purported to follow its two-step 
framework; or examined §3283’s legislative history. Instead, both decisions simply 
assumed that a criminal statute of limitations can be applied retroactively absent an 
Ex Post Facto problem under Stogner.  See Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at 924; 
Jeffries, 405 F.3d at 685.  But see Richardson, supra. 
C. Count Six is also barred by the Statute of Limitations  
Count Six (2001-2004) charging §1591 is also time-barred because the 2003 
amendment to §3283 cannot be applied retroactively under Landgraf for the 
reasons stated above. In addition, §3299 cannot be applied retroactively.  In 2006, 
Congress enacted §3299 to eliminate the limitations period for §1591. But since 
the sex trafficking in Count Six predates the enactment of §3299, Count Six is 
time-barred unless the statute applies retroactively. Landgraf’s “presumption 
against statutory retroactivity” forecloses retroactive operation of this statute at 
step two as the Government has conceded elsewhere. 511 U.S. at 293. see U.S. v. 
Schneider, C.A. No. 10-29, 2010 WL 3656027, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2010) 
citing U.S. v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1975). Accordingly, Count Six is 
time-barred.

POINT III 
DEFENDANT WAS DENIED HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A 
FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY BECAUSE A JUROR MADE FALSE 
STATEMENTS IN VOIR DIRE AS TO MATERIAL FACTS THAT, IF 
KNOWN, WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A VALID BASIS TO REMOVE 
HIM FOR CAUSE. U.S. Const. amend. VI. 
A. Introduction   
After the trial concluded, a juror gave multiple interviews in which he 
disclosed that he actively used his own self-described traumatic experience as a 
victim of child sexual abuse to convince certain members of the jury to overlook 
issues of credibility surrounding the victims and to convict Maxwell. Defendant 
moved for a new trial, contending that the juror’s presence on the jury violated her 
Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. Dkt 613, 642.  The court ordered an 
evidentiary hearing limited to questions concerning Juror 50’s false statements on 
the juror questionnaire. A239. 
At the hearing, Juror 50 gave a patently absurd explanation for his failure to 
give truthful answers to multiple questions on the juror questionnaire. 
Nevertheless, the court found that Juror 50 testified credibly at the hearing and that 
Juror 50 would not have been stricken for cause even if he had answered each 
question on the questionnaire accurately. Accordingly, the court concluded that 
Defendant failed to satisfy the demanding requirements of the controlling Supreme 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page78 of 113

Court decision, McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 
104 S. Ct. 845 (1984). 
In any event, there was ample evidence establishing that Juror 50 harbored 
actual bias and that the similarities of his child sexual abuse to the case supported a 
finding of implied and inferred bias at the time of jury selection such that, had 
Juror 50 given truthful answers at the time of jury selection, Defendant would have 
interposed a valid challenge for cause. A new trial must be ordered. 
B. Applicable Law 
“When it is discovered that a juror gave false answers during voir dire, any 
motion for a new trial must first be analyzed under the Supreme Court’s test in 
McDonough Power Equity v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984). Under a two-part 
test, a party must show that “a juror failed to answer honestly a material question 
on voir dire.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556. Second, the party must show that “a 
correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”  Id.   
Moreover, a new trial can be ordered without a finding of actual prejudice. Arizona 
v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 307-10 (1991). The standard of review for a district 
court’s denial of a motion for a new trial is abuse of discretion. See, Rivas v. 
Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d. Cir. 1996). 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page79 of 113

C. Juror No. 50’s False Responses Deprived Ms. Maxwell of her 
Constitutional Right to a Trial by an Impartial Jury 
1. Juror 50 Did Not Truthfully Answer Material Questions During Voir 
Dire 
Juror No. 50’s answers to Questions 25 ,48, and 49 were indisputably false. 
Juror Questionnaire at A289  
At the hearing, Juror No. 50 admitted that he gave multiple false answers 
during voir dire which resulted in the concealment of his experience as a victim of 
child sexual abuse but denied that his misstatements were intentional. Of some 50 
questions, only questions that would have revealed his sexual abuse history were 
answered incorrectly.  Juror 50 denied that he had ever been a victim of a crime 
because he was thinking about other types of crime and because his “healing 
process” meant that he did not consider himself a victim (#25); denied that he was 
the victim of sexual abuse because he was distracted and misread the question 
(#48); and denied that he had a family member who had been accused of a crime 
because he did not think of his step-brother who sexually abused him as family 
(#49). A268-270. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page80 of 113

D. Under the McDonough Test, Juror 50’s Actual, Implied and Inferred 
Bias was established. 
1. The McDonough Test: The First Prong 
“Intentionally false” answers are not a prerequisite to satisfying the first 
prong of the McDonough test. Although the Court held that “a party must first 
demonstrate that a juror failed to honestly answer a material question on voir dire,” 
its focus on whether the juror was “honest,” did not mean that an inadvertent 
mistake or inaccurate answer, not given deliberately, would not satisfy the test. 
McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556. Quite the opposite, a verdict can be undermined, and 
a new trial ordered, “regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest.” 
Id. at 557-59. Thus, “false” means inaccurate or materially misleading, not 
necessarily deliberately false or untruthful. United States v. Langford, 990 F. 2d 
65, 68 (2d Cir. 1993). Here, as Juror No. 50’s answers were plainly untrue, the first 
prong under McDonough was satisfied. 
2. The McDonough Test: The Second Prong 
Pursuant to McDonough, once an untrue voir dire response has been 
discovered, the next question is would truthful answers have provided a valid basis 
for a challenge for cause? United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 303 (2006). 
“[T]he test is not whether the true facts would compel the Court to remove a juror 
for cause, but rather whether a truthful response ‘would have provided a valid basis 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page81 of 113

for a challenge for cause’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 470. Challenges for 
cause can be based on implied bias, inferred bias, or actual bias. United States v. 
Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1997). Clearly, had Juror No. 50 disclosed his 
“traumatic” victimization, his truthful answers to follow-up questions would have 
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause because of the similarity of Juror 
50’s sexual abuse experience to the evidence in the case and the materiality of the 
nondisclosures. 
In determining whether Juror No. 50 was biased, and whether a hypothetical 
challenge for cause would have been granted, a court should consider several 
factors, including (1) the similarity between Juror No. 50’s past experience and the 
experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial, as well as (2) the severity of the 
juror’s dishonesty, and (3) the juror’s motives for lying. See, Sampson v. United 
States, 724 F.3d 150, 166 (1st Cir. 2013).  
Here, Juror 50’s undisclosed experience was strikingly similar to the 
experiences described by the witnesses at trial. Juror 50 was a victim of childhood 
sexual abuse; was abused as a minor on multiple occasions over the course of 
several years; was abused by someone he knew and trusted and another person; 
and delayed disclosing the abuse for years. A267-268. Juror 50’s experience is 
more troubling because it directly bore upon Maxwell’s central trial defense i.e., 
that the testimony of the complaining witnesses was unreliable because it 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page82 of 113

concerned memories of events that occurred so long ago and that those memories 
of Maxwell’s peripheral involvement in the abuse were motivated and distorted by 
external events.  This issue was so central to the trial that the defendant called an 
expert to testify about memories.  
Assuming Juror 50 recounted a version of his abuse similar to what he 
described at the hearing and in media interviews, there is no question that he would 
have been excused on consent, stricken for cause or by an available peremptory 
challenge.12   In the event that Juror 50 answered truthfully, Juror 50 would have 
been questioned at length by the court, in camera. Honest answers to those 
questions would certainly have resulted in a valid challenge for cause.  
E. 
The District Court Abused its Discretion in the Manner in Which 
it Conducted the Post-Trial Hearing 
The court abused its discretion in precluding cross-examination of Juror 50 by 
the defense and in limiting the scope of the questions. 
The potential jurors who admitted to being victims of sexual assault and were 
not stricken for cause, reported conduct such as groping, harassment at work or on 
the subway, and inappropriate touching in social settings - conduct that was 
drastically different than the abuse suffered by Juror 50 – drastically different from 
the abuse suffered by Juror 50 and the victims herein. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page83 of 113

1. The Court Erred in Precluding Defense Counsel From Questioning 
Juror 50 
Once the court ordered a hearing, it was essential that Maxwell be afforded a 
meaningful opportunity to have her counsel participate in the hearing. Although 
judges normally enjoy “broad flexibility” in addressing claims of jury misconduct, 
cases involving “media publicity or other outside influences” constrain their 
leeway. United States v. Thai, 29 F. 3d 785, 803 (2d Cir. 1994). See, United States 
v. Daugerdas, Case No. 09-CR-581 (William H. Pauly) (procedure followed in 
identical situation acknowledged that defense counsel was in best position to 
conduct the examination of the juror).  
Defense counsel was not permitted to cross-examine Juror 50 and many of 
their proposed questions were rejected by the court. For example, the court refused 
inquiry into Juror 50’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and 
specifically whether he spoke with a therapist about the case during the trial; the 
details of his sexual abuse to assess how similar it was to the stories of the 
accusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir 
dire; and his public statements both about traumatic memories and his participation 
as a juror. A277-281. The court should have permitted Maxwell’s attorneys to 
probe the impact that the sexual abuse had on the juror in other aspects of his life 
and assess whether his answers reflected an actual or implied bias as his voluntary 
post-verdict public comments surely did. The court’s. hypothetical questions about 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page84 of 113

what he might have said in voir dire four months earlier, had he been truthful, were 
pointless.  
2. FRE 606 Did Not Prevent Inquiry into Juror 50’s Use of Prior Abuse in 
Persuading Jury to Convict Maxwell 
The court erred in applying Federal Rule of Evidence 606 to preclude any 
testimony from Juror 50 about his statements to journalists. 
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) precludes a juror from testifying about deliberations 
and jurors’ mental processes in the course thereof but allows testimony regarding 
extraneous prejudicial information, i.e., when certain outside influences on the jury 
are involved. Rule 606(b) expressly authorizes jurors to testify as to “extraneous 
prejudicial information” or “outside influences.” The rationale behind 606(b) is the 
need to prevent post-trial scrutiny, the harassment of former jurors by losing 
parties, and to promote juror privacy. See, Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107 
(1987).  
In this case, however, we are not faced with a conflict between policy 
considerations underlying Rule 606(b). Indeed, such public policy concerns are 
inapplicable in this case, where the juror, on his own, broadcast his experiences 
and the role he played in jury deliberations. Inquiry into these statements does not 
risk exposing a juror to harassment or intimidation. In fact, the only reason the 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page85 of 113

parties were aware of such statements is due to Juror 50’s own conduct. In such a 
situation, Juror 50 does not get to use 606(b) as a shield.   
Rule 606(b)’s exception for extraneous prejudicial information is applicable 
here. First, had this information been disclosed, Juror 50 would have been 
disqualified or excluded from being a member of the jury. Second, his statements 
demonstrate that he used information, concealed during voir dire, to operate as an 
unsworn expert on the subject of traumatic memory for which he was not 
qualified.13 And, third, questioning Juror 50 about his statements to media would 
have provided the defense with an opportunity to establish through probing 
questions the credibility of Juror 50’s conclusory protestations that he could be fair 
and establish a valid basis for a cause challenge. Thus, testimony on this topic was 
admissible as an exception to 606(b).  
F. 
The District Court Erred in Finding that (1) Juror 50 was Not 
Biased and (2) Juror 50 Would Not Have Been Stricken Even if 
He Had Answered the Questions Accurately 
Here, the District Court abused its discretion in unfairly limiting the hearing 
and in making clearly erroneous factual findings, namely, that Juror 50’s hearing 
Dr. Elizabeth Loftus testified that people “don’t just record events and play it 
back later like a recording device would work, like a video machine, but rather, we 
are actually constructing memories when we retrieve memories.” (Tr. at 2427).  
However, Juror No. 50 stated that the memories of the abuse he suffered can be 
“replayed like a video.” Lucia Osborn-Croweley, Ghislaine Maxwell Juror Breaks 
Silence To The Independent: This Verdict Is For All The Victims,” Independent 
(Jan. 4, 2022).   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page86 of 113

testimony was credible and that, had he given truthful answers during voir dire, he 
would not have been dismissed for cause.   
The District Court erred when it did not find any bias (actual, implied, or 
inferred) on the part of Juror 50. Juror 50’s testimony revealed that he was not, and 
could not have been, a fair and impartial juror. At the outset, Juror 50’s explanation 
for his untruthful responses on the questionnaire only as to questions that would 
have revealed his sexual abuse history were not credible, rendering his self-serving 
statements that he was unbiased unreliable. His post-verdict statements show how 
closely he identified with the victims in this case. For example, Juror 50 stated that 
the verdict against Maxwell was a verdict “for all the victims.”  During his hearing 
testimony, he told the trial court that after “seeing the victims be brave enough to 
give their story, I felt like if they can do it, so can I.” (H. 24.)  As a victim of child 
sexual abuse, he was not capable of “separating [his] own life experiences from the 
evidence in the case.” Sampson, 724 F. 3d at 167.  
The court abused its discretion when it credited Juror 50’s patchwork of self-
serving explanations for his false answers to questions that could have led to the 
disclosure of his sexual abuse history. His explanation that he did not see the word 
“you” in question #48 is implausible since he saw it everywhere else. Juxtaposed 
with his other excuses for false statements, namely, that he did not consider a step-
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page87 of 113

brother to be family (#49) and that he did not consider sexual abuse a crime (#25), 
his answers border on the absurd.  
A review of Juror 50’s statements to the media and hearing testimony 
reveals that, after he retained and was advised by counsel, he took great pains to 
downplay his prior sexual abuse. But his view of the way all victims recall 
memories – which are at odds with the defendant’s expert – revealed a bias that 
would have prevented him from serving as a juror, were he to have disclosed it. 
Thus, the court erred when it found that Juror 50 would not have been stricken as a 
juror even if he had answered the questions accurately during voir dire. 
POINT IV 
THE COURT CONSTRUCTIVELY AMENDED  
COUNTS THREE AND FOUR OF THE INDICTMENT 
A jury note sent during their deliberations (A230) clearly indicated that 
the jurors were considering convicting Maxwell on Count Four of the 
Indictment based solely on Jane’s testimony about sexual activity in New 
Mexico. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction 
to the jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a 
conviction on Count Four because it was not a violation of New York law. 
Instead, the Court directed the jury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. 
The jury ultimately convicted Maxwell on Count Four and the two Mann Act 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page88 of 113

conspiracies (Counts One and Three). There is a substantial likelihood that the 
jury believed that sexual activity that violated New York Penal Law §130.55 
need not have occurred in New York and that Maxwell was convicted of Count 
Four based on Jane’s testimony about sexual activity with Epstein at his ranch 
in New Mexico. 
Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury 
with an alternative basis for conviction that was entirely distinct from the 
charges in the Indictment. The Court’s refusal to correct the jury’s obvious 
misunderstanding, constituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance 
from the charges in the Indictment.  Accordingly, this Court should vacate 
Maxwell’s convictions on Counts Three and Four and grant a new trial. 
A. 
Background Facts 
1. The Jury Note 
During their deliberations, the jury sent a note (the “Jury Note” or the 
“Note”) inquiring about the proper basis to convict under Count Four of the 
Indictment (the substantive transportation count). The Jury Note read as 
follows: 
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation 
of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if 
the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be 
found guilty under the second element? 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page89 of 113

A238  
The second element of Count Four in the Jury Charge to which the jury 
plainly refers requires  “that Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate 
commerce with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any 
person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” 
namely, “New York Penal Law, Section 130.55, sexual abuse in the third 
degree.” Tr. 3037:10-19 
B. 
Applicable Law 
To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must 
demonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are, in effect, altered by the 
presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential 
elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the 
defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the 
indictment.” United States v. D'Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 416 (2d Cir. 2012). A 
constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury Clause requiring 
reversal. Id at 417. 
The defendant must be “given notice of the core of criminality to be proven 
at trial.” Id.  “After identifying the core of criminality, a court must then 
determine whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial 
likelihood that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in that 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page90 of 113

core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one alleged.” D’Amelio, 683 
F.3d at 419-21). The standard of review is de novo. D'Amelio, at 416.  
 In contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment 
are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from 
those alleged in the indictment.” Id. (quoting United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 
608, 621 (2d Cir. 2003)). A defendant alleging variance must show “substantial 
prejudice” to warrant reversal.  
Rigas, 490 F.3d at 226. 
1. The “Core of Criminality” of Counts Three and Four Was a 
Scheme to Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with 
an Intent to Violate New York Law. 
The  “core of criminality” of the Mann Act transportation offenses was a 
scheme to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they 
would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment 
itself was clear on its face. Count Four, specifically alleged in the “to wit” 
clauses that the charges were based on Jane’s travel “from Florida to New 
York, New York” where Maxwell intended for her to engage in sex acts with 
Epstein “in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55.” Ind. ¶ 21 at 
A129. Count Three alleged that the object of the conspiracy was to cause 
underage girls to travel across state lines with the intent that they “engage in 
sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense” 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page91 of 113

(Ind. ¶ 18 at A128) and specified that the relevant criminal offense was a 
“violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55.” Ind. ¶19b at A128. And 
the Government consistently represented to the court, in numerous conferences 
and filings, that a conviction under the Mann Act counts had to be based on an 
intent or an agreement to violate New York Penal Law §130.55. See, e.g., 
11/1/2021 Tr. 68:2- 4; Dkt. 410-1 at 52; and Tr. 2775:3-6.  
It follows, then, that evidence that Jane traveled to any other state besides 
New York and engaged in sexual activity, even if illegal under that state’s laws, 
would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Maxwell of Count Four.  If Maxwell 
were convicted on Counts Three or Four based solely on such conduct, that 
would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See 
Millstein, 401 F.3d at 65; Wozniak, 126 F.3d at 106-08; Roshko, 969 F.2d at 4-
6. 
2. There is a Substantial Likelihood that. Maxwell Was Convicted 
on Counts Three and Four Based on Conduct Not Charged in the 
Indictment. 
There is a substantial likelihood that Defendant was convicted on Count 
Four based solely on conduct in New Mexico.  
The jurors were not given the Indictment and the jury charge failed to 
include that the relevant interstate travel “as charged in the Indictment” was 
travel “from Florida to New York, New York,” despite a defense request. Dkt. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page92 of 113

410-1 at 19; Tr. 2758:23-2760:9. 
Count Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane. Jane recalled 
one trip to New Mexico when she was “15 or 16.” Tr. 321:6- 321:13. She flew 
to New Mexico with Epstein and Maxwell and stayed at Epstein’s ranch. Tr. 
321:14-322:6., and, while there, she was sexually abused. Tr. 322:7-323:19. 
Based on Jane’s testimony and the Note, there is a substantial likelihood 
that the jury improperly based its conviction solely on the sexual abuse that 
Jane experienced in New Mexico. The jurors had the mistaken impression that 
it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found 
that Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, 
even though such conduct was not and could not have been “sexual activity in 
violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55.”       
The corroborating evidence supports the theory that the jury did not 
credit Jane’s testimony that Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s 
sexual abuse in New York and was instead focused on her involvement in the 
New Mexico conduct. The most important piece of evidence corroborating 
Jane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot, Dave Rodgers. 
See GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence 
offered at trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York 
and New Mexico and when those trips may have taken place. According to the 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page93 of 113

flight logs, there were only two trips that Jane may have taken while she was 
under the relevant age of 17. The first from Palm Beach to New York 
(Teterboro) on November 11, 1996 (GX-662-R at 44) and the second from New 
York (Teterboro) to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, 1997, both when Jane 
was 16 (GX- 662-R at 48). The critical difference between the two trips was 
that Maxwell was not a passenger on the first trip to New York but was a 
passenger on the second trip to New Mexico.  
Given the text of the Note, it is likely that the jurors decided that there 
was no corroborating evidence that Maxwell was present for, or helped to 
arrange, any of Jane’s trips to New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate 
that Maxwell was present for Jane’s trip to New Mexico. As a result, the jury 
began evaluating Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip to see if it 
supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question posed by 
the Jury Note. 
This is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Maxwell on the 
substantive enticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that 
the only corroborating evidence linking Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a 
flight log showing that she was present on the trip but said nothing about 
whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced” Jane to take the trip. 
Hence, the acquittal on Count Two. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page94 of 113

they found that Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from 
New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place, they could convict 
her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that 
arranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count 
Four. Hence, the question in the Jury Note. 
Thus, it was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental 
instruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for 
conviction under Count Four. The Court’s refusal to do so allowed the jury to 
modify the essential elements of the charged offense and created a substantial 
likelihood that Maxwell was convicted of a crime other than the one alleged in 
the Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 419-21. 
Moreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted 
Maxwell on Count Four based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a 
substantial likelihood that they improperly convicted her on the related 
conspiracy count (Count Three) based on the same conduct. The substantive 
transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object of the conspiracy 
charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to 
violate New York law.

C. 
The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the 
Allegations 
in 
the 
Indictment 
Substantially 
Prejudiced Maxwell. 
In the alternative, the Court must vacate Maxwell’s convictions on 
Counts Three and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the 
proof at trial and the allegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced 
Maxwell as elaborated above.  
Here, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning 
Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told 
the FBI about the trip to New Mexico, she had denied being sexually abused 
there. It was not until just before trial, that Jane claimed for the first time that 
she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at the ranch.  
For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s convictions on Counts Three and 
Four were based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The 
Court must vacate these convictions and grant a new trial on these counts. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page96 of 113

POINT V 
THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE VACATED AND REMANED  
FOR RESENTENCING AS THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN 
APPLYING AN INCORRECT GUIDLINE RANGE AND OFFENSE 
LEVEL. 
The defendant’s sentence should be vacated because the District Court 
erroneously calculated the guidelines range; imposed an upward variance, without 
providing the required explanation; and mistakenly applied the aggravating role 
adjustment.  Accordingly, the sentence must be vacated and remanded back to the 
District Court for re-sentencing, or – in the interest of justice - the defendant’s 
sentence should be substantially reduced. 
A. Standard of Review. 
The standard of review for all sentences requires a “deferential abuse-of-
discretion standard.” United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d. Cir. 2008). A 
review has two components: procedural and substantive. Id. The procedural review 
“must first ensure that the District Court committed no significant procedural 
errors. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). Here, the District Court 
improperly calculated the guidelines range in the first instance and then deviated 
upwards without any explanation for doing so.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page97 of 113

B. Procedural Errors. 
The Presentence Report (“PSR”), using the 2004 Sentencing Guidelines, 
initially calculated a guidelines range of 292-365 months, based on a total offense 
level of 40 and a criminal history category of I, but recommended a downward 
variance to 240 months’ imprisonment.  SH19.14 
The District Court, using the 2003 Guidelines, initially miscalculated the 
applicable guidelines range.  After realizing its error and adjusting to the correct 
guideline range, the court imposed a sentence above the corrected guidelines range 
without accounting for the upward variance. The court's initial miscalculation of 
the guidelines range carried serious consequences for the defendant, as it appears 
that the court believed it was imposing a guidelines sentence when, in fact, it 
imposed a sentence above the guideline range. After the court’s calculation error 
was pointed out, and the range was significantly reduced, the court did not amend 
its sentence, which then became an upward variance.   
The PSR delineated mitigating factors and reasons for the downward variance.  
But the court simply stated that it agreed with the PSR’s recommendation of 240 
months, without addressing the variance. The court based its sentencing decision of 
240 months on a miscalculation and then adhered to its pre-determined sentence 
Numerical references preceded by “SH” are to the Sentencing Hearing on June 
28, 2022. 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page98 of 113

even after it was made aware that its sentence was predicated on a miscalculation 
in the first instance.   
Importantly, the court procedurally erred because it then failed to provide 
reasons for its upward variance both orally and in writing.  18 U.S.C. Section 
3553(c)(2). 
C. The District Court improperly applied the four-level aggravating role 
adjustment under USSG § 3B1.1. 
The court erred in applying the four-level aggravating role enhancement under 
USSG §3B1.1.  Were this enhancement not applied, the proper offense level would 
be 33, which would correspond to a lesser guideline range of 135-168 months.  To 
qualify for the enhancement under USSG §3B1.1, “the defendant must have been 
the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.” 
USSG §3B1.1., cmt. n.2.  A “participant is defined as ‘a person who is criminally 
responsible for the commission of the offense but need not have been convicted.” 
Id.     
The Government argued that Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen. Yet the trial 
evidence belies this assertion. During the trial, Carolyn testified that Kellen 
scheduled massage appointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm 
Beach residence. Tr. 1527-28; 1538-39.  The Government acknowledged that 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page99 of 113

“there wasn't direct evidence about, you know, the defendant directly instructing 
Kellen to make a certain phone call, and we acknowledge that.” A406.  The court 
pointed to the testimony of Larry Visoski as support for the fact that Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant. A417.  But Visocki’s testimony does not support this 
inference either. While Visoski initially testified that he “thought” Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant, he later clarified that “he didn’t know what her exact job” 
was; did not know whether Kellen was Epstein’s assistant or Maxwell’s assistant; 
and that his best recollection was that Kellen was “an employee who worked with 
Epstein.” Tr. 204.  Further, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was Epstein’s 
assistant, and that she – not Kellen- was Maxwell’s assistant. Tr. 2332-33, 2376-
77.  Espinosa further testified that, during the time Kellen interacted with Carolyn, 
Epstein and Maxwell had ended their romantic relationship and “went their 
separate ways.” Tr. 2370-71.  Indeed, even Carolyn testified that there was a clear 
break in the time when Maxwell called her to schedule massages and when Kellen 
began calling her. Tr. 1527.   
Given the dearth of evidence, the government failed to meet its burden of 
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell supervised Kellen in 
any capacity, much less was there any inference available to suggest that there was 
supervision of a criminal nature. Thus, the court erred in applying the 
enhancement.   
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page100 of 113

CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, all counts should be vacated and the indictment 
dismissed. However, based on the preceding arguments, the Court may determine 
that only Counts Three and Four or Three and Six should be reversed.  In either 
scenario, the Court should order a new trial on the remaining count. This is due to 
the prejudice having resulted from the admission of evidence to prove Counts 
Three and Four or Three and Six. United States v. Rooney, 37 F.3d 847, 855 (2d 
Cir. 1994). In weighing a claim of prejudicial spillover, courts look at several 
factors, one being the “similarities and differences” between the evidence on the 
reversed counts and the remaining counts. Id. When the evidence admissible to 
prove the remaining counts arises from a distinct set of facts in a different time-
period, involving a different complainant and the evidence admissible to prove the 
dismissed counts would not have been admissible to prove the remaining count, 
courts will find prejudice warranting a new trial on the remaining counts. Id.  
Here, Counts Four and Six arise from distinct facts, time-periods, and 
complainants. Count Four is based on the testimony of Jane concerning conduct 
between 1994 and 1997, while Count Six is based on the testimony of Carolyn 
concerning conduct between 2001 and 2004. Plainly, much of the evidence to 
prove the dismissed counts would not have been admissible to prove the remaining 
Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page101 of 113

count (whether it be Count Four or Six).  Accordingly, a new trial on the remaining 
count would be required. 
For the Reasons Stated in Points I and II, the Convictions Should Be 
Vacated and the Indictment Dismissed.  For the Reasons Stated in Points III 
and IV, the Convictions should be Vacated and the Matter Remanded for a 
New Trial. For the Reasons Stated in Point V, the Court Should Remand To 
the District Court for Resentencing.

STANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION
As part of your supervised release, you must comply with the following standard conditions of supervision.  These conditions are imposed
because they establish the basic expectations for your behavior while on supervision and identify the minimum tools needed by probation
officers to keep informed, report to the court about, and bring about improvements in your conduct and condition. 

You must report to the probation office in the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside within 72 hours of your
release from imprisonment, unless the probation officer instructs you to report to a different probation office or within a different time
frame.

After initially reporting to the probation office, you will receive instructions from the court or the probation officer about how and
when you must report to the probation officer, and you must report to the probation officer as instructed.

You must not knowingly leave the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside without first getting permission from the
court or the probation officer.

You must answer truthfully the questions asked by your probation officer.

You must live at a place approved by the probation officer. If you plan to change where you live or anything about your living
arrangements (such as the people you live with), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying
the probation officer in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72
hours of becoming aware of a change or expected change.

You must allow the probation officer to visit you at any time at your home or elsewhere, and you must permit the probation officer to
take any items prohibited by the conditions of your supervision that he or she observes in plain view.

You must work full time (at least 30 hours per week) at a lawful type of employment, unless the probation officer excuses you from
doing so.  If you do not have full-time employment you must try to find full-time employment, unless the probation officer excuses
you from doing so. If you plan to change where you work or anything about your work (such as your position or your job
responsibilities), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying the probation officer at least 10
days in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours ofbecoming 
aware of a change or expected change.

You must not communicate or interact with someone you know is engaged in criminal activity.  If you know someone has been
convicted of a felony, you must not knowingly communicate or interact with that person without first getting the permission of the
probation officer.

If you are arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours.

You must not own, possess, or have access to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device, or dangerous weapon (i.e., anything that was
designed, or was modified for, the specific purpose of causing bodily injury or death to another person such as nunchakus or tasers).

You must not act or make any agreement with a law enforcement agency to act as a confidential human source or informant without
first getting the permission of the court.

S2 20 CR 330 (AJN)
You shall submit your person, and any property, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communication,
data storage devices, cloud storage or media, and effects to a search by any United States Probation Officer, and if
needed, with the assistance of any law enforcement. The search is to be conducted when there is reasonable suspicion
concerning violation of a condition of supervision or unlawful conduct by the person being supervised. Failure to submit to
a search may be grounds for revocation of release. You shall warn any other occupants that the premises may be subject
to searches pursuant to this condition. Any search shall be conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.
You shall undergo a sex-offense-specific evaluation and participate in an outpatient sex offender treatment and/or
outpatient mental health treatment program approved by the U.S. Probation Office. You shall abide by all rules,
requirements, and conditions of the sex offender treatment program(s), including submission to polygraph testing and
refraining from accessing websites, chatrooms, instant messaging, or social networking sites to the extent that the sex
offender treatment and/or mental health treatment program determines that such access would be detrimental to your
ongoing treatment. You will not view, access, possess, and/or download any pornography involving adults unless
approved by the sex-offender specific treatment provider. You must waive your right of confidentiality in any records for
mental health assessment and treatment imposed as a consequence of this judgment to allow the U.S. Probation Office to
review the course of treatment and progress with the treatment provider. You must contribute to the cost of services
rendered based on your ability to pay and the availability of third-party payments. The Court authorizes the release of
available psychological and psychiatric evaluations and reports, including the presentence investigation report, to the sex
offender treatment provider and/or mental health treatment provider.
You must not have contact with the victim(s) in this case. This includes any physical, visual, written, or telephonic contact
with such persons. Additionally, you must not directly cause or encourage anyone else to have such contact with the victim
(s).

playgrounds, and arcades. You must not view and/or access any web profile of users under the age of 18. This includes,
but is not limited to, social networking websites, community portals, chat rooms or other online environment
(audio/visual/messaging), etc. which allows for real time interaction with other users, without prior approval from your
probation officer.
You must provide the probation officer with access to any requested financial information.
You must not incur new credit charges or open additional lines of credit without the approval of the probation officer unless
you are in compliance with the installment payment schedule.

AFFIRMATION 
Docket No. 22-1426 
STATE OF NEW YORK 
) 
COUNTY OF NEW YORK 
: 
ss.: 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ) 
ANDREW A. ROHRBACH, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby affirms 
under penalty of perjury: 
1. 
I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of Damian 
Williams, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  I am one 
of the attorneys representing the Government in this appeal. 
2. 
I respectfully submit this Affirmation in support of the Government’s 
unopposed motion (1) to file an oversized brief of no more than 20,000 words in 
order to respond adequately to the arguments raised in the brief of defendant-
appellant Ghislaine Maxwell, which uses approximately 19,950 words, and (2) for a 
30-day extension of time to file its brief from May 30, 2023, until June 29, 2023, 
Case 22-1426, Document 70, 04/26/2023, 3505512, Page2 of 8

and a related extension of the deadline for Maxwell to file her reply brief until July 
27, 2023. 
3. 
Maxwell appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on June 29, 
2022, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, by 
the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States Circuit Judge, sitting by designation, 
following a four-and-a-half-week jury trial. 
4. 
Superseding Indictment S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Indictment”) was 
filed on March 29, 2021, in eight counts. Count One charged Maxwell with 
conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 371.  Count Two charged Maxwell with enticement of a minor to engage 
in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.  Count Three charged 
Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Four charged Maxwell with transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2423(a) and 2.  Count Five charged Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Six charged Maxwell with sex trafficking of a 
minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2.  Counts Seven and Eight 
charged Maxwell with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.  The charges related 
to Maxwell’s facilitation and participation in the sexual abuse of minor girls over 
the course of a decade. 
Case 22-1426, Document 70, 04/26/2023, 3505512, Page3 of 8

5. 
Maxwell’s trial on Counts One through Six commenced on November 
29, 2021 and ended on December 29, 2021, when Maxwell was convicted on Counts 
One and Three through Six, and acquitted on Count Two. 
6. 
On June 29, 2022, Judge Nathan sentenced Maxwell principally to 60 
months’ imprisonment on Count Three, 120 months’ imprisonment on Count Four, 
240 months’ imprisonment on Count Six, all to run concurrently, as well as a 
$750,000 fine. 
7. 
Maxwell is serving her sentence. 
8. 
On July 7, 2022, Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of 
conviction. 
9. 
On July 28, 2022, Maxwell requested an extended deadline for her 
opening brief of January 30, 2023 (instead of the ordinary 91-day deadline of 
October 14, 2022), which this Court granted on August 1, 2022. 
10. 
On January 12, 2023, Maxwell filed an unopposed motion for an 
extension of time to file her opening brief from January 30, 2023, until February 28, 
2023, which this Court granted on January 17, 2023. 
11. 
On January 16, 2023, Maxwell filed a motion to file an oversized brief 
of no more than 20,000 words, which this Court granted on January 18, 2023. 
12. 
On February 14, 2023, Maxwell filed a motion to file an oversized brief 
of no more than 35,000 words, which this Court denied on February 22, 2023.   
Case 22-1426, Document 70, 04/26/2023, 3505512, Page4 of 8

13. 
On February 28, 2023, Maxwell filed her opening brief on appeal, 
which contains approximately 19,950 words. 
14. 
Maxwell’s brief raises at least five issues: (1) whether the indictment 
should have been dismissed pursuant to a nonprosecution agreement signed by 
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida; 
(2) whether all counts were barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (3) 
whether a juror’s misstatements during voir dire deprived Maxwell of her right to a 
fair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District Court constructively amended two 
counts of the indictment when responding to a jury note; and (5) whether the District 
Court improperly applied an aggravating role adjustment when calculating the 
applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range.  
15. 
As the foregoing summary reflects, there is factual and legal complexity 
in the issues raised by Maxwell, and the Government’s responses to these arguments 
require in-depth factual and legal analysis.  Although the Government is endeavoring 
to limit the size of its brief, a complete and useful response to Maxwell’s brief cannot 
reasonably be accomplished in fewer than 20,000 words. 
16. 
The Government is requesting the 30-day extension due to an 
unavoidable scheduling conflict.  Specifically, I am the attorney with primary 
responsibility for drafting the Government response brief in this appeal.  On April 
18, 2023, trial for another matter in which I am counsel was scheduled to begin on 
Case 22-1426, Document 70, 04/26/2023, 3505512, Page5 of 8

May 22, 2023.  See United States v. Kenneth Wynder & Andrew Brown, 20 Cr. 470 
(PKC) (S.D.N.Y.).  Accordingly, in the remaining weeks prior to the current 
deadline for the Government’s brief in this appeal, I will need to prepare for and 
conduct a trial in another matter.  A 30-day extension will permit the Government 
to fulfill its obligations both to this Court and the district court by allowing the 
Government time to prepare its response to Maxwell’s brief without interfering with 
the preparation for and conduct of the Wynder & Brown trial.  As noted above, 
Maxwell sought and received permission to file her opening brief at the end of 
February, more than four months after it ordinarily would have been due under this 
Court’s rules.  Accordingly, the comparatively modest adjournment requested by the 
Government will not substantially prejudice Maxwell. 
17. 
On April 19, 2023, the Government conferred by email with Diana 
Samson, Esq., counsel for Maxwell, and she reported that Maxwell would not 
oppose this motion if the Government also were to request that Maxwell receive an 
extension of time to file her reply brief from July 20, 2023, to July 27, 2023.  
Assuming the Government receives its requested extension to June 29, 2023, the 
Government consents to the requested extension of time to file Maxwell’s reply brief 
to July 27, 2023. 
18. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Government respectfully requests (1) 
leave to file an oversized brief of no more than 20,000 words, which is the 
Case 22-1426, Document 70, 04/26/2023, 3505512, Page6 of 8

approximate length of the brief to which it must respond in this appeal, and (2) an 
extension of time to file its brief until June 29, 2023, and, if that extension is granted,
an extension of the time for Maxwell to file her reply brief until July 27, 2023.  
19.
I affirm under penalties of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, that 
the foregoing is true and correct.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
investigated allegations that in 2007-2008, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA).  The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged 
in illegal sexual activity with girls.1  OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed 
professional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was 
signed or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.   
I. 
OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein 
in 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.  
Epstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and 
other United States and foreign locations.  The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used 
personal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those 
massages led to sexual activity.  After the PBPD brought the case to the State Attorney’s Office, a 
Palm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July 19, 2006, for felony solicitation of 
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07.  However, because the PBPD Chief and the 
lead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s handling of the case and believed that 
the state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the 
matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal 
investigation.  
The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor’s approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta.  
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course 
of the investigation, they discovered additional victims.  In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her 
supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein.  She also provided a 
lengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and 
addressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges. 
For several weeks following submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed 
indictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine how to proceed.  At a  
July 31, 2007 meeting with Epstein’s attorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if 
Epstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, 
registered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain 
monetary damages.  The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications 
with Epstein’s team of attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the 
federal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007.  The 
As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who 
were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged conduct.   Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age 
of 18.

NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against 
him and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require 
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03.  The NPA required Epstein to make a binding 
recommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed 
by 12 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”).  The NPA also included 
provisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein.  In 
exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in 
the Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential 
co-conspirators.”  Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or 
the NPA prior to its signing.         
The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration, 
however.  For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys 
to try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously 
seeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no 
federal interest at issue and the matter should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement 
officials.  Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials, 
defense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms.  They also sought and 
obtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a 
quintessentially state matter.”  After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on 
June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General informed defense counsel that the 
Deputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter.  Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill 
his obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to 
the pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA, 
to a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.  
Upon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the 
court immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of 12 months’ incarceration on the 
solicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months 
of community control.  Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm 
Beach County facility.  A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.          
On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern 
District of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated  the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein 
without consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.2  In responding to 
the petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did 
not produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective 
order; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.  After the initial filings and 
hearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil 
cases against Epstein.

the litigation as “Jane Doe 2.”

Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work 
release program, and the Sheriff approved his application.  In October 2008, Epstein began 
spending 12 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity 
Epstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of 
Epstein’s attorneys.  Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein 
received “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months 
of incarceration.  On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home 
detention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts 
for release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge 
in September 2009 ordered it to be made public.   
By mid-2010, Epstein reportedly settled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by 
victims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation.  During 
the CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial 
document productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and 
submitted declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal 
investigation.  The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was 
permitted to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues.  Nevertheless, the court 
ultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case 
be made public.  During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting 
the CVRA.  After failed efforts to settle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment 
remained pending for more than a year.     
In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor.  At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.  On  
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.    
In the decade following his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to 
settle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims.  Epstein was otherwise able 
to resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.  On November 28, 2018, 
however, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal 
criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced 
girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.3  The Miami Herald 
reported that in 2007, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the 
NPA, which permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison 
sentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.”  According to the Miami 
Herald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and 
concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.  Through its reporting, which included 
interviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper 
painted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a 
wealthy man with powerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime” 
that allowed him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his

abuse of minors.  The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the 
government’s actions.4    
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the 
victims about its intention to enter into the NPA.5  The court also found that letters the government 
sent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic] 
the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.”  The court also highlighted 
the inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time 
engaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA 
would not be “made public or filed with the court.”  The court ordered the parties to submit 
additional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies.  After the court’s order, the Department 
recused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Northern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government.  Among the remedies sought 
by the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal 
prosecution of Epstein.     
On July 2, 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained 
a federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and 
one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.  The indictment alleged that from 
2002 until 2005, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida 
whom he sexually abused and exploited.  Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2019.  In 
arguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s 
Manhattan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least 
one believed to be a minor.  The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded 
to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
Manhattan.   
Meanwhile, after publication of the November 2018 Miami Herald report, the media and 
Congress increasingly focused attention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the 
NPA.  On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s 
actions.  Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office “was ready to allow Epstein to 
walk free with no jail time, nothing.”  According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered 
this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a 
resolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims 
with the means to obtain monetary damages.  Acosta’s press conference did not end the 
controversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as

v 
Secretary of Labor.  In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on 
his handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor 
Department.   
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.  
The New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed suicide.   
As a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of  
New York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein.  On  
August 27, 2019, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s 
victims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke 
about the impact of Epstein’s crimes.  The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on  
August 29, 2019.  
After Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation 
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.  Among its findings, 
the court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had 
asserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had 
not litigated in bad faith.  The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its 
representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper 
treatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.   
On September 30, 2019, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe 1” filed in her true name a petition 
for a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking 
review of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies.  In its responsive brief, 
the government argued that “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern 
District of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.”  Nevertheless, during oral 
argument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the 
petitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in 
fact the NPA had been signed.”  On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied 
the petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not attach until a defendant has been criminally charged.  
On August 7, 2020, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s 
opinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set 
for December 3, 2020.  
II. 
THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION 
After the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2018,  
U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency 
Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2018 letter to OPR, citing the Miami 
Herald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this 
reporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice attorneys.”  On February 6, 2019, the 
Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened

vi 
an investigation into the matter and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through the NPA.6  
After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR 
included within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that 
formed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford 
victims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was 
signed and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal 
investigation. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of 
the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  
The records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected 
and reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein.  OPR also 
examined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and 
other court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books 
relating to the Epstein case.      
In addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews 
of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel; 
current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior 
managers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General 
for the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in 
charge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys 
representing victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and the FBI.   
OPR identified former U.S. Attorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the 
AUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of 
them was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations 
leading to the agreement.  OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of 
its investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result 
in a finding of professional misconduct.  OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta 
and another subject.  All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation.  OPR requested 
that all of the subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement in the federal 
investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim 
notification and consultation.  OPR received and reviewed written responses from all of the 
subjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before 
a court reporter.  Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant 
contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.  The subjects reviewed and 
provided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.  OPR 
The federal government was closed from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019.  After initiating its 
investigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the 
status of the OPR investigation.

vii 
carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed 
appropriate; OPR did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions.      
Finally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and 
attorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case 
and to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct. 
As part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the 
federal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state 
officials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state 
investigation.7  Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department attorneys adhere to the 
standards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject 
attorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal 
behavior.  Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his 
assistants’ conduct as it was known to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as 
Department attorneys.  Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008, 
when Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to 
that date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent 
information.   
OPR’s investigation occurred approximately 12 years after most of the significant events 
relating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.  As a result, 
many of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their own or 
others’ actions occurring in 2006-2008, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they 
reviewed at the time.8  However, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly 
by extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the 
government and defense counsel.  These records often referred to the interactions among the 
participants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.      
III. 
OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
OPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in 
accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal 
law enforcement agency.  Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct 
against current or former Department attorneys related to the exercise of their authority to 
In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.  As reported, the 
investigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.   
OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution 
of, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2019.  Moreover, as the line prosecutor in 
the Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that 
litigation in early 2019, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions 
to review these materials in the course of her official duties.  Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a written 
response, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these 
materials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in 
preparation for their interviews.

viii 
investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.9    OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations 
of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department 
attorney’s alleged professional misconduct.   
In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs 
the challenged conduct and whether a subject attorney violated that standard.  Department 
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of 
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by attorney 
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies.  OPR finds misconduct when it 
concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a standard 
intentionally or recklessly.  Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that 
(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the 
subject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct.  In some cases, OPR may conclude 
that a subject attorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional 
misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding.  In such cases, OPR may 
conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted 
inappropriately under the circumstances.  OPR may also determine that the subject attorney’s 
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.10   
IV. 
ISSUES CONSIDERED 
In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations.  The first relates to 
the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA.  The second relates to the USAO’s 
interactions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA.  The two sets 
of issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report. 
A. 
The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA 
In evaluating whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR 
considered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute, 
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy.  In particular, OPR 
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination 
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants 
C.F.R. § 0.39a(a)(1).  OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring 
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during 
OPR’s investigation.  Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department 
attorneys.  Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that 
a former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an 
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority.  Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct 
of Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.   
In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after 
a preliminary inquiry into the matter.  In December 2010, one of the attorneys representing victims in the CVRA 
litigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation 
and that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA.  Pursuant to its 
standard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the 
then-pending CVRA litigation.

of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens.  The potentially applicable standards that 
OPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report.  OPR 
also examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter 
into the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive, 
such as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism.  OPR also examined and 
discusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed 
that shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation. 
B. 
The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA 
To address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content, 
and timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was 
signed, including victim notification letters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews 
conducted by the USAO.  OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear 
and unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification.  OPR examined the 
government’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the 
circumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s 
victims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
V. 
OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in 
various decisions and events.  Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of 
the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led 
to the NPA.  Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved 
it, with knowledge of its terms.  During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved 
the NPA and accepted responsibility for it.  Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for 
the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions.  Acosta’s overall 
responsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less 
clear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR 
evaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.  
A. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA 
With respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects 
did not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and 
approval of the NPA.  Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a 
subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing 
the conduct at issue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict 
Epstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.  
Furthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable 
standards.  
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.  Acosta’s decision to decline to

x 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not 
find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations.  Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one 
of Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution.  Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.  Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances.  In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     
B. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with 
Victims  
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims.  The subjects did not have 
a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the 
NPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal 
charge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA 
rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not 
established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were 
brought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose 
of silencing victims.  Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 12 of 348
SA-12
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page14 of 258

xi 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s 
treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the 
Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.  
OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.  
Moreover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims.     
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights 
requirements.  Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.  
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims’ attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct.  
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims.  Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      
After examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The 
overall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 13 of 348
SA-13

that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.   
VI. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT 
The Report is divided into three chapters.  In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant 
federal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal 
conduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.  
OPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with 
the subjects.     
In Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal 
investigation of Epstein.  The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young 
victim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law 
enforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2006 opening of the federal 
investigation; the September 2007 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent 
efforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2008 
guilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with 
the terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July 
2010.  After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations 
relating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA.  OPR 
describes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’ 
conduct.  
Chapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s 
findings regarding the CVRA.  OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’ 
conduct in light of the pertinent standards.    
OPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including 
internal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full 
understanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.

Undermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative  
Steps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case ...........................175

CHAPTER ONE 
SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS 
I. 
THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
A. 
The Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
The Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department 
headed by the United States Attorney General.  The stated mission of the Department is to enforce 
federal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal 
leadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful 
behavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice.  The Department enforces 
federal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal 
statutes.  It also engages in civil litigation.  During the period relevant to this Report, the 
Department had approximately 110,000 employees in 40 components.  The Department’s 
headquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations 
around the nation and overseas. 
The prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Attorney’s 
Offices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate) 
U.S. Attorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Attorney 
General through the Deputy Attorney General.1  The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by 
an Assistant Attorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also 
prosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Attorney’s Offices, and provide legal 
expertise and policy guidance.  Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this 
Report are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and 
Intellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section 
(CEOS). 
CEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises attorneys and investigators who specialize 
in investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology, 
and they assist U.S. Attorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these 
offenses.  CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel, 
and government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution 
policies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.  
 The U.S. Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2018 and renamed the Justice Manual) 
is a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department 
employees.  It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division 
Two U.S. Attorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are 
headed by a single U.S. Attorney.  The Attorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting 
and interim U.S. Attorneys.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 27 of 348
SA-27
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page29 of 258

or other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal enforcement, such as the Civil Rights 
Division.  In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.     
During the period most relevant to this Report, the Attorney General was Michael 
Mukasey, the Deputy Attorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Attorney General for 
the Criminal Division was Alice Fisher.  The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterbaan.    
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal 
matters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-
Dade, Broward, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and 
Highlands, an area of over 15,000 square miles.  During the period relevant to this Report, the 
USAO had a staff of approximately 200 Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) and 200 support 
personnel.  The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale, 
West Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office 
is located in Key West.  The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 70 miles from the 
Miami office.  The USAO is headed by the U.S. Attorney; the second-in-command is the First 
Assistant U.S. Attorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Attorney and 
supervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions, 
each of which is headed by a Chief.  During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm 
Beach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.    
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency 
and is part of the Department.  It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Attorney’s Offices.  
The FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, known 
as Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.  
The Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach 
Resident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.  FBI responsibility for advising 
crime victims of their rights and of victim services available to them is handled by non-agent 
Victim Specialists. 
The following chart shows the Department’s organizational structure during the period 
relevant to this Report:

B. 
The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies 
Florida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Attorney 
in each of the state’s 20 judicial circuits, headed by a State Attorney who is elected to a four-year 
term.  Palm Beach County constitutes the 15th Judicial Circuit.  Barry Krischer was the elected 
State Attorney for that circuit from 1992 until January 2009.  During the period relevant to this 
Report, the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach, 
had more than 100 attorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed 
by Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek.     
The incorporated Town of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of 
West Palm Beach.  Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).  
Michael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in 1981, served as PBPD Chief from 2001 to February 2009. 
The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is 
the largest law enforcement agency in the county.  Through its Department of Corrections, the 
PBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed 
minimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility.  The current 
Sheriff has served continuously since January 2005. 
II. 
THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE 
R. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida in June 2005, at age 36.  In June 2006, President George W. Bush formally nominated 
Acosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney in October 2006.   
After graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an 18-month 
term as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years 
as a policy fellow and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General in the Department’s Civil Rights Division.  He was presidentially appointed in 2002 as a 
member of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2003 as Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2003 until his 
appointment as Interim U.S. Attorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution 
of human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases.  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta’s office was in the 
USAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.   
During Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Attorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of 
Epstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-
prosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report.  Acosta made the decision to 
resolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allowing Epstein to enter a state plea.  
Acosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations 
of the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO.  Acosta continued to 
provide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s 
attorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007, 
and Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 30, 
2008.  On December 8, 2008, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state 
prison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all matters involving the law firm of 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 30 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page32 of 258

Kirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the 
firm about possible employment.    
After leaving the USAO in June 2009, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International 
University College of Law.  In April 2017, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he 
resigned from that post effective July 19, 2019, following public criticism of the USAO’s handling 
of the Epstein case.   
Jeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in 1990 as a line AUSA.  In 2001, he became Deputy 
Chief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in 
2003, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office.  In early 2004, Sloman was appointed 
Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division.  In October 2006, Sloman became the FAUSA, and 
Sloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.   
As FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate 
Divisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.  
Although Sloman had relatively little involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the 
NPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA, 
which he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2007.  After subordinates Matthew Menchel 
and Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafaña, 
on Epstein matters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.  
After Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein matter in December 2008, Sloman became 
the senior USAO official supervising the matter.  When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became 
the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2010, the Attorney 
General appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Attorney for the district.  Sloman left the USAO 
to enter private practice in June 2010. 
Matthew I. Menchel joined the USAO in 1998 after having served as a New York County 
(Manhattan) Assistant District Attorney for 11 years.  After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel 
became Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section.  In October 2006, Menchel became the Chief 
of the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami.  As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was 
part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings 
and other communications with defense counsel.  Menchel participated in the decision to extend a 
two-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense.  Shortly after 
that plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2007, and before the precise terms of the 
NPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.   
Andrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in 1994, after having served for three 
years as an AUSA in New Jersey.  During his 13-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two 
terms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity 
Section, first from September 2001 until September 2002, and then from February 2006 until July 
2006.  Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2006, Lourie was 
a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West 
Palm Beach branch office.  Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein 
investigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with 
defense counsel.  During September 2007, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie 
transitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General

for the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant 
Attorney General Alice Fisher.  Lourie left the Department in February 2008 to enter private 
practice.  
Ann Marie C. Villafaña joined the USAO in September 2001 as a line AUSA.  She served 
in the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2004, when she transferred to the West Palm 
Beach branch office.  Villafaña handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm 
Beach, along with other criminal matters.  In 2006, she was designated as the USAO’s first 
coordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual 
exploitation and abuse.2   
In 2006, Villafaña assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation.  As the line AUSA, 
Villafaña handled all aspects of the investigation.  Villafaña determined the lines of inquiry to 
pursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible 
charges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department.  Villafaña, along 
with the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.  
She handled court proceedings related to the investigation.  She drafted a prosecution 
memorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to 
comments from those in her supervisory chain of command.  Villafaña participated in meetings 
between members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for 
management in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those 
meetings.  Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve 
the federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafaña was the primary USAO 
representative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her 
supervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO.  Thereafter, 
Villafaña monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his 
conduct.  After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights 
under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (“the CVRA litigation” or “the 
CVRA case”), in July 2008, Villafaña served as co-counsel to the lead attorney representing the 
USAO until February 2019, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.3  Villafaña 
left the USAO in August 2019 to join another federal government agency.  
The following chart shows the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO 
personnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.
Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2006 to combat the 
growing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.  Led by the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices 
and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute 
individuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  
After the district court issued its February 21, 2019 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government, 
the Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.

III. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS 
A. 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Jeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1953.4  Although he did not graduate 
from college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhattan 
from 1974 until 1976.  Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street 
firm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited 
partner before leaving in 1981.  An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear, 
Epstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur 
through whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtown Manhattan, where he resided.  In the early 
1990s, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida.  He also owned a private island 
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France.  He traveled 
among his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.   
Epstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other 
entities, in numerous locations.  Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and 
extent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.5  He associated with 
prominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and 
engaged in substantial philanthropy.  Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including 
housekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom 
traveled with him.    
B. 
Epstein’s Defense Attorneys 
Jeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense attorneys in responding to the 
allegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach, 
Florida estate.  As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the 
allegations, he added attorneys having particular relevant knowledge of, or connections with, those 
entities.  At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami 
criminal trial attorney Roy Black.  He was also represented by a local criminal defense attorney 
who was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney, and by nationally prominent 
Harvard Law School professor and criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who was a self-
described close friend of Epstein.  After initial plea negotiations with the State Attorney’s Office, 
Epstein replaced the local attorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal 
defense attorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Attorney handling the 
Epstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Attorney was removed from the 
Epstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest.  Another prominent attorney who began 
representing Epstein during the state investigation was New York City attorney Gerald Lefcourt, 
Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.  See, e.g., Landon Thomas 
Jr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2002; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr. 
Epstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2003; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and 
Lurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2019; Lisette Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Façade Finally Cracks,” 
Forbes, July 12, 2019.  
After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and 
trust documents.  https://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.

whose law firm website cites his “national reputation for the aggressive defense” of “high-profile 
defendants in criminal matters.”      
In late 2006, after the USAO opened its investigation, Epstein hired Miami criminal 
defense attorneys who were former AUSAs.  One, Guy Lewis, had also served as the U.S. 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and as Director of the Department’s Executive Office 
for United States Attorneys, the component charged with providing close liaison between the 
Department and the U.S. Attorneys.  Another, Lilly Ann Sanchez, had served in the USAO and 
as a Deputy Chief in the Major Crimes Section before leaving in 2005.  In August 2007, 
immediately after the USAO offered the terms that ultimately led to the NPA, two attorneys from 
the firm of Kirkland & Ellis, one of the largest law firms in the country, contacted the USAO on 
Epstein’s behalf:  Kenneth Starr, former federal judge and Solicitor General, who was serving as 
Dean of Pepperdine University School of Law while of counsel to the firm; and Jay Lefkowitz, a 
litigation partner who had served in high-level positions in the administrations of Presidents 
George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.  They were joined by nationally prominent Boston 
criminal defense attorney Martin Weinberg.  After the NPA was signed, former U.S. Attorney 
Joe D. Whitley joined the defense team, as did the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS and 
another former U.S. Attorney, who was also a retired federal judge.

CHAPTER TWO 
THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT  
PART ONE:  FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
In the following sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
details the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the 
negotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the 
NPA from taking effect.  OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled 
guilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement.  In describing 
events, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails.  In many 
instances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the 
issues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions.  When 
helpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations 
as provided in their written responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by 
witnesses. 
A timeline of key events is set forth on the following page. 
II. 
MARCH 2005 – MAY 2006:  EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM 
BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE 
ATTORNEY’S OFFICE 
A. 
The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation 
In March 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid 
their daughter $300 to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.6  The PBPD began 
investigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants, 
who were also implicated by the complainant.  The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial 
claim, to encompass allegations that during 2004 and 2005, Epstein, through his female assistants   
As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of 18.  Epstein’s contacts with girls and young 
women previously had come to the attention of the PBPD.  In March 2004, a PBPD officer documented a telephone 
complaint that a 17-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for 
$200 per massage.  The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered 
to cooperate with a police investigation.  The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as 
“unverified,” and it was not pursued.     
On November 28, 2004, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed 
coming and going from Epstein’s residence.  The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the 
PBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not 
investigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the matter.

and some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him 
massages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.    
Through their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.  
Some girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him.  The 
nature of the massages varied.  According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they 
massaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude.  Victims stated 
that during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself.  Some victims alleged that he touched 
them during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or 
through their clothing.  Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and 
some stated that he digitally penetrated them.  Some victims who stated that they saw him more 
often alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them.  According to one victim, an 
Epstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at 
Epstein’s direction.7   
Although the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent 
in describing a general pattern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants.  According to 
the information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled 
up to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment 
while Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences.  Typically, when a girl 
arrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and 
bathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils.  When 
the assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a towel.  After removing his 
clothing, Epstein lay face down and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her 
clothing, and then explained to her how he wished her to perform the massage.  During the 
massage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.  
When Epstein climaxed, the massage was over.  Usually, Epstein paid the girl $200 for the 
massage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact 
her in the future.  Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls 
interested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to 
perform a massage, each girl would receive $200.  Several of the victims acknowledged to the 
PBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.   
The evidence regarding Epstein’s knowledge of the girls’ ages was mixed.  Some girls who 
recruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were 
over 18 years old.  However, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages. 
Police were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flowers to her at her high school 
after she performed in a school play.  In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some 
of the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.    
Epstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning.  He retained local 
criminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators.  In October 2005, the PBPD, 
with the assistance of the State Attorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s 
residence.  When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 20, 2005, to execute the warrant, 
According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than 
this female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 39 of 348

they found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance 
cameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic 
storage media—were gone.  Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home, 
including notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a 
two-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments.  The police also found numerous 
photographs of naked young females of indeterminate age.  Police photographs taken of the interior 
of Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and 
master bedroom and bathroom area.  The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s 
high school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.  
B. 
The State Attorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury 
State Attorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that 
police brought the case to his office without having made an arrest.  Krischer was unfamiliar with 
Epstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit.  PBPD Chief Michael 
Reiter stated in a 2009 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State 
Attorney’s Office in 2005, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go 
for it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”  
Krischer told OPR, however, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that 
“there were witness problems.”   
Assistant State Attorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told 
OPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Attorney who initially worked with her on the 
case “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”  
According to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the 
elements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed, 
unlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.05(1)) and lewd and lascivious 
molestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 800.04(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”8  
In addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant, 
who could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation 
of sexual contact.  Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of 
probation, which he rejected.9 
Records publicly released by the State Attorney’s Office show that, beginning in early 
2006, attorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allow Epstein to plead “no 
contest” rather than guilty.  To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and 
presented the State Attorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of 
the victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as 
MySpace pages) about their own sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared 
to undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knowledge of victims’ ages.  Krischer 
Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge 
Epstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.   
In April 2006, the State Attorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree 
felony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation 
with no unsupervised contact with minors.     
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 40 of 348
SA-40
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page42 of 258

told OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought attorney Alan Dershowitz to see Krischer and the 
Assistant State Attorney, but Dershowitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going 
to destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.”  According 
to Krischer, Dershowitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local attorney Jack 
Goldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.”  Because the husband of the 
Assistant State Attorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the Assistant State 
Attorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took 
over the case.  Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally known New York criminal 
defense attorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer 
to dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by attacking the credibility of the victim 
witnesses.   
Meanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the 
case to a grand jury.  Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2016, 
his office prosecuted minors as young as 14 for prostitution.10  The possibility that Epstein’s 
victims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and 
according to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.11  Belohlavek 
told OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an 
organized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we . . . 
thought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”  However, she said, although 
Epstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can 
charge.”  Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to 
my mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice 
was to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.   
C. 
Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges 
Federal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable 
by imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.12  
Under Florida law, however, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death 
penalty case.13  For all other cases, a State Attorney has concurrent authority to file criminal 
charges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.  
Although Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often 
utilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by 
public officials.14  Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among 
Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.   
Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Attorney’s Office’s 
handling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR 
his office’s prosecutive decisions. 
U.S. Const. amend. V; Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(a), (b).  The sole exception under the rule is felony criminal 
contempt, which need not be charged by indictment.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(a)(1).

other things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and 
proscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.15             
D. 
PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Attorney’s Office’s 
Handling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation  
In 2006, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s attitude had changed and, according 
to Reiter’s statements in his 2009 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were 
credible.  Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein 
to appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s 
objectivity and the State Attorney’s Office’s approach to the case.  As Reiter explained in his 
deposition: 
This was a case that I felt absolutely needed the attention of the State 
Attorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court.  It’s 
not generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court.  And I 
knew that it didn’t really matter what the facts were in this case, it 
was pretty clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute 
this case. 
On May 1, 2006, Reiter submitted to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing 
package relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein 
first victimized and then used to recruit other girls.  In his transmittal letter, which was later made 
public, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Attorney’s Office’s “treatment of 
these cases [to be] highly unusual.”16  Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that 
your office’s handling of this matter has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from 
prosecuting Epstein.17

May 2006 – February 2007:  The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the 
USAO Opens a Case File 
In early 2006, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with 
AUSA Ann Marie Villafaña on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as 
“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafaña in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD 
was investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity.  The case 
agent told Villafaña that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Attorney’s Office 
was considering either not charging the case or allowing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor 
Fla. Stat. § 905.27 (2007). 
See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. 14, 2006. 
As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions; 
however, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that 
way.”

charge.  Villafaña suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before 
formally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see how the State Attorney’s Office 
decided to charge Epstein. 
1. 
The PBPD Presents the Matter to the FBI and the USAO 
In May 2006, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafaña and 
the FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s 
investigation.18  At the time, neither Villafaña nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any 
knowledge of his background.   
According to Villafaña, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure 
had been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s attorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were 
concerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.19  The Detective 
explained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had 
raised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated 
the removal of the Assistant State Attorney initially assigned to handle the matter, who was viewed 
as an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense attorney whose relationship with the Assistant 
State Attorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor.  Further, given the missing computer 
equipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been 
“tipped off” in advance about the search warrant.   
During the meeting, Villafaña reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could 
be brought against Epstein.  She focused on 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into 
prostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce 
to persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423 
(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct).  As they discussed these charges, the 
Detective told Villafaña that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach 
International Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to 
passengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references 
to underage girls.  However, the Detective acknowledged that he was unable to confirm that 
suspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate 
or internationally.  Nevertheless, Villafaña believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part 
because of his own interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse 
girls.  Villafaña discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed 
to prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified.  She told them that if the evidence 
supported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal 
investigation would not preclude the State Attorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it 
choose to do so.   
The Detective died in May 2018.   
In his 2009 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein matter to the FBI, a Town of Palm 
Beach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims 
were not believable and “Palm Beach solves its own problems.”

2. 
May 2006:  The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File   
On May 23, 2006, Villafaña prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file.  Villafaña 
told OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a 
federal prosecution:  (1) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate 
commerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that 
Epstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the 
computer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure 
had affected the State Attorney Office’s handling of the case.  The investigation was named 
“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as 
victims of Epstein’s conduct.20   
Villafaña told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that 
the case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and 
Epstein’s financial resources.  Nonetheless, Villafaña was willing to put in the effort and believed 
that the FBI was similarly committed to the case.  Villafaña discussed the case with her immediate 
supervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the 
USAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2006, it was formally initiated.   
3. 
July 14, 2006:  Villafaña Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case 
Because Villafaña was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and 
learned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation.  Villafaña was aware that Epstein 
had hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Attorney’s Office in an effort to derail the 
state case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal 
investigation.   
Therefore, Villafaña arranged to meet with U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey 
Sloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.21  Villafaña told OPR that she had never 
before asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that 
Epstein had improperly influenced the State Attorney’s Office greatly troubled her.  Villafaña 
explained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the 
Epstein investigation.  In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular 
confidence.  At this point, although Villafaña’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case, 
Villafaña did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office 
and her second-line supervisor, about the matter or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman. 
Villafaña met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July 14, 2006.  She told OPR that at 
the meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to 
Villafaña opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its 
“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafaña to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood 
coordinator.   
Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Attorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed 
by the Senate until August 3, 2006, and was not sworn in until October 2006.  In September 2006, Acosta announced 
the appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Matthew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they 
assumed their respective new offices in October 2006.

Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure” 
to avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring attorneys who had personal connections to the 
State Attorney.  Villafaña said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset 
of the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely 
employ.  Villafaña explained, “When you have a case that you know people are going to be getting 
calls about . . . you just want to make sure that they know about it so they don’t get . . . a call from 
out of the blue.”  According to Villafaña, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to 
put the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t 
want to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had 
occurred with the state.  She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected 
the case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s 
resources if the Office would just back down to pressure at the end.”  According to Villafaña, 
Acosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.”  In a later 
email to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafaña recounted that she spoke with Acosta and 
Sloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal 
prosecution if the U.S. Attorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green 
light” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.   
Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2006 meeting with 
Villafaña.  Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not 
previously heard of Epstein.22   
Acosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man 
who was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable matter to pursue” 
federally.  Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told 
OPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.”  When asked by OPR to articulate the 
federal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the 
exploitation of girls or minor females.”  Regarding Villafaña’s view that she had been given a 
“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have 
explicitly told Villafaña to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been 
simply to acknowledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal 
investigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”   
Sloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein 
investigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Attorney’s Office had 
“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein.  In his OPR interview, 
Sloman did not recall with specificity Villafaña’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the 
State Attorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect 
the USAO, noting that as of July 2006, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically 
connected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.   
Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of 
Epstein.  On July 24, 2006, Villafaña emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as 
a “Manhattan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and 
Kevin Spacey.”  Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.

4. 
Late July 2006:  The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves 
Forward with a Federal Investigation 
Several days after Villafaña spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July 19, 2006, Assistant 
State Attorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.23  Krischer told OPR that 
“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury.  According to a statement made at the time by the 
State Attorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest 
to lowest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of 
the room.24  The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony under state law because 
it alleged three or more instances of solicitation.25  The indictment did not identify the person or 
persons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.26  On July 23, 
2006, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the 
charges were made public.   
Villafaña told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that 
point because she believed the State Attorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a 
reduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy 
might preclude a federal prosecution.27  Villafaña told OPR that at the time, she “definitely 
believed that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that . . . we had 
sufficient evidence.” 
Villafaña and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed 
them.  Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance 
in this Report.   
Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2006, citing 
statement by State Attorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.   
Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2006CF9454AXX (July 19, 2006), attached as Exhibit 1 to this Report. 
In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the 1st day of August [2004] and October 31, 2005, 
[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three 
or more occasions.”  The 15-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made 
it impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the 
state indictment.  Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward 
at trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.   
The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal 
charges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses.  The Constitution does not prohibit the federal 
government from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquitted, or convicted on state charges based on 
the same criminal conduct.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition 
against double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns.  See, e.g., Gamble v. United 
States, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1960, 1966-67 (2019) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 
187, 195 (1959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 382 (1922).  Nonetheless, to 
better promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in 1959 and 1960 to 
guide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.  See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a 
more detailed discussion of the Petite policy.

On July 24, 2006, Villafaña alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Attorney’s 
Office had charged and arrested Epstein.28  On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally 
opened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it.  Villafaña 
told Sloman that the FBI agents “are getting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to 
review everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal 
charges against Epstein was August 25, 2006.  Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was 
“appropriate to approach [State Attorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might 
go?”  Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.”29   
Although Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more 
active role in supervising the investigation, Villafaña continued to update Acosta and Sloman 
directly on the progress of the case.30  Villafaña’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had 
little involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafaña directed her 
emails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor.  In the 
immediate supervisor’s view, however, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the 
case, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”31   
By late August 2006, Villafaña and the FBI had identified several additional victims and 
obtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that show the 
communication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates.  Villafaña 
reported to her supervisors that the State Attorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the 
state grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to 
relinquish the evidence to the FBI.”  Villafaña also told her supervisors that she expected “a 
number of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply 
“after having contact with Epstein or his attorneys.”   
Villafaña’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask 
whether she was referring to the victims.  Villafaña responded that the problems did not involve 
victims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to 
document demands as overly burdensome.  Villafaña explained to Sloman and Lourie that some 
victims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but 
“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.”  Villafaña 
On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafaña had not yet briefed about the case, noting that 
Operation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”   
During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was 
likely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some 
type of relationship between somebody in the [State Attorney’s Office] and the defense team.”  
After Villafaña sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman, 
and Acosta on August 23, 2006, Lourie emailed Sloman:  “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the 
case?”  Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.  If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it 
through you guys.”      
OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office, 
that is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel.  Records show, and Villafaña told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s attorneys 
“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory 
chain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 47 of 348

also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped 
statements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies 
will be noted and considered.”  She conceded that “[g]etting them to tell their stories in front of a 
jury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the 
course.”  She acknowledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”   
The case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered 
up very well” with the USAO.  She recalled that there was little higher-level management oversight 
either from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were allowed to do what we needed to do to get our 
job done.”  This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein 
employees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial 
transactions.  The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”   
5. 
October 2006 – February 2007:  Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate 
Contact with Villafaña, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting 
Just as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became 
aware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and 
because the government was seeking records from his businesses.  One of Epstein’s New York 
attorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafaña in August 2006.  As the 
investigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal 
prosecution.32  As with the state investigation, Epstein employed attorneys who had experience 
with the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.33  One of Epstein’s 
Miami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2006.34  Lewis telephoned 
Villafaña, a call that Sloman joined at Villafaña’s request.  Lewis offered to provide Villafaña 
Villafaña told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.” 
Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the attorneys known to have represented 
Epstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the 
Department, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation.  At least one former AUSA also represented 
during civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein.  Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized 
Epstein was selecting attorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as 
“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”  Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”   
Lewis served in the USAO for over 10 years, and was U.S. Attorney from 2000 to 2002.  He then served for 
two years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the 
U.S. Attorneys.  
Early in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that 
Lourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA 
and also represented Epstein.  Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law 
partner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal.  The Professional 
Responsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under 
the conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.”  Thereafter, Sloman authorized 
Lourie to continue supervising the case.  During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to 
Lewis did not influence his handling of the case.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 48 of 348

“‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process.  Lewis asked to meet with Villafaña 
and Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafaña declined.   
Shortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him 
that she also represented Epstein.  Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2000 to September 
2005 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was 
the Chief.  According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when 
Sanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafaña led the defense team 
to believe that the matter had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of 
that notion.  Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible” 
in working with the USAO.  Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO 
on Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a letter to Villafaña on November 15, 2006, in which she asserted 
that she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact 
or communications about Epstein to them.  In response, Villafaña requested that the defense 
provide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents 
and information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Attorney’s Office, and 
“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media” 
removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2005.  In 
January 2007, Sanchez contacted Villafaña to schedule a meeting, but Villafaña responded that 
she wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.   
Immediately after receiving Villafaña’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafaña and phoned 
Lourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting.  Lourie agreed 
to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt.  Lourie explained to Villafaña that Sanchez was concerned 
that federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and 
promised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that 
would be a possibility.”  Villafaña told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents 
she had promised, and Villafaña wanted “the documents not the pitch.”  Lourie explained to OPR, 
however, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for 
us” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is power.”  Lourie further 
explained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO 
form its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged.  Lourie 
also believed that as a general matter, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a 
presentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.”  In addition to 
agreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narrowed document request, which responded to 
Sanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the 
demand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home.  The meeting was scheduled 
for February 1, 2007, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the 
USAO by January 25, 2007. 
Villafaña did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt.  Indeed, 
two days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafaña alerted him that she had spoken again with 
Sanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents.  As Villafaña 
told Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about how the girls are liars and drug users.”  
She told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what 
the defense would say, and she could not see how a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.  
She explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently” 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 49 of 348
SA-49
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page51 of 258

disagreed with her position.  Villafaña and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was 
consulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled 
meeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.  
They perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.35  According to Villafaña, Lourie believed 
that a meeting with the defense attorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal 
theories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO 
might learn information helpful to a prosecution.  Villafaña told OPR, however, that while this 
strategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or 
worthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to 
the conduct.  Villafaña also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information 
about the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended 
to charge, which Villafaña did not want to reveal.

February 2007:  Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaña and 
Present the Defense Objections to a Federal Case 
At the February 1, 2007 meeting with Lourie and Villafaña, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out 
arguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal 
investigation.  In support of their arguments, the defense attorneys provided a 25-page letter, along 
with documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential 
impeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.    
In the letter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (1) the allegations did not 
provide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that 
Epstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving 
that any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the 
Petite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a matter that had already been addressed by the 
state; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.  
The letter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have 
affected” the USAO’s view of the case.  The letter also claimed that the State Attorney’s Office 
had taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s 
two principal victims (identified by name in the letter), and argued that “with witnesses of their 
ilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.”  Lourie told OPR 
that he did not recall the meeting, but Villafaña told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded 
by the defense presentation at this “listening session.” 
B. 
February – May 2007:  Villafaña and the FBI Continue to Investigate; 
Villafaña Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for 
USAO Managers to Review 
Correspondence between Villafaña and defense counsel show that Villafaña carefully 
considered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes 
Villafaña told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being 
“strategic thinkers.”  Her fellow AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as 
having occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.  Lourie did not recall making 
the statement but acknowledged that he could have.

of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.36  Villafaña 
also pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert 
witness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims.  She also continued collecting records 
relating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s 
activity.  On several occasions, Villafaña sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable 
national expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as 
whether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.  
USAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a 
prosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case.  The prosecution memorandum was 
expected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant 
procedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues; 
expected defenses; and sentencing issues.  Routine prosecutions could be approved by lower-level 
supervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and 
approval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Attorney.  
Accordingly, Villafaña drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta, 
Sloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous 
October, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May 1, 
2007, supporting a proposed 60-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes 
relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors.  The prosecution memorandum set forth 
legal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other 
statutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and 
potential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who 
were expected to testify at trial.    
Villafaña’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum, 
had only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it.  The 
immediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the 
case was complex and that Villafaña would need co-counsel.   
In his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and 
proposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to 
employ a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that 
presented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already 
raised credibility issues to use in cross-examination.  Lourie told OPR that although he had some 
concerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues 
and the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as 
insurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution. 
Although indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require 
approval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office 
involvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go 
Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follow-up meeting with Lourie and Villafaña on 
February 20, 2007, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.

forward with charges in this case.  Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to 
Menchel.  Lourie’s transmittal message read: 
Marie did a 50 [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case.  I am going 
to start reading it tonight. . . .  It’s a major case because the target is 
one of the richest men in the country and it has been big news.  He 
has a stable of attorneys, including Dershowitz, [Roy] Black, 
Lefcourt, Lewis, and Lily [sic] Sanchez.  Jeff Sloman is familiar 
with the investigation.  The state intentionally torpedoed it in the 
grand jury so it was brought to us.  I am going to forward the pros 
memo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do.  The 
FBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical, 
but we might as well get a jump on it.  I have some ideas about the 
indictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am 
not sending that yet. 
Lourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not 
have impeachment evidence to use against them.   
A few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution 
memorandum.  Lourie directed Menchel’s attention to particular pages of the prosecution 
memorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled 
for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they 
were 18.37  Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think 
the office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Attorney’s Office “went out of their 
way to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain 
away to nothing.”   
During his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmitting the prosecution 
memorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never 
heard of Epstein and had no information about his background.  He recalled that the USAO had 
been asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately.  Menchel told 
OPR, however, that he had little memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous 
opinions he formed about it.  
Acosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafaña’s prosecution 
memorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,” who had more 
prosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the 
case with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document.   Acosta 
In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that 
engaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was 
motivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes.  The defense also 
asserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under 18, but that 
Epstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least 18 years of age.”  In her prosecution 
memorandum, however, Villafaña set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual 
act was one of the motivating factors for the travel.  She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the 
defendant knew the victims were minors.          
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 52 of 348

recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he 
could not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the 
discussions.   
Sloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to 
Menchel, as a highly experienced trial attorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly 
with Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular 
review” of the charging package.  Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a 
team” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking 
the lead on the Epstein matter, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.   
C. 
May – June 2007:  Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum 
and Proposed Charges 
When she submitted the prosecution memorandum, Villafaña intended to file charges by 
May 15, 2007, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafaña, however, 
had not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule.  The managers in Miami wanted time to 
analyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging 
strategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that 
the FBI was planning a press conference for May 15, Sloman advised Villafaña that “[t]his Office 
has not approved the indictment.  Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”38    
On May 10, 2007, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafaña’s 
prosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterbaan, who in turn sent it to his deputy 
and another CEOS attorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and 
describing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”39  After 
CEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterbaan responded to Lourie with an email stating that the 
memorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafaña “has correctly focused 
on the issues as we see them.”  He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to 
the statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafaña’s assessments but noting that further 
research was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s 
knowledge of victims’ ages.  Oosterbaan offered to assign a CEOS attorney to work with Villafaña 
on the case.  Lourie forwarded Oosterbaan’s email to Menchel and Villafaña.    
Meanwhile, contemporaneous emails show that Lourie, at least, was already considering 
an early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.40  After Lourie spoke with 
Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a 
beauty pageant . . . where he is a judge.”  The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed 
with the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it.  After the federal 
investigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2006, Epstein largely stayed 
away from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.      
Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterbaan was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good 
friends with Lourie.   
In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may 
undermine our arguments for pretrial detention.”  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening 
a bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 53 of 348

the FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2007, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be 
quickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding, 
“I did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and 
offer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment.  That 
would have sent them thru the roof.”  Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing 
an indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea 
involving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.41   
Lourie told OPR that despite Oosterbaan’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was . . . a 
bit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterbaan had cited.  
Although Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably” 
did not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of 
walking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.”  But while Lourie “thought 
we could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were 
nearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a 
plea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a 
loss would be that the defendant did not go to jail.  Lourie told OPR that to the best of his 
recollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government 
might have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to 
require Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the 
victims.  Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should settle and we should set it up so we can 
settle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited 
charges in a criminal information.  Villafaña told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal 
complaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the 
case was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” toward a pre-indictment plea.   
Although Lourie and Villafaña believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired 
resolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to 
work together to shape an indictment.   On May 10, 2007, Lourie emailed Villafaña: 
[M]arie 
I believe that Epstein’s att[orneys] are scared of the victims they 
don’t know.  Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.  
Thus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims 
they have nothing on at all.  We can add in the other ones that have 
myspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding 
indictment].  I think for the first strike we should make all their 
nightmare[]s come true.  Thoughts?42 
Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s 
approval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as 
set forth in an extensive indictment, might not allow substantive counts to be dismissed.   
Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information 
brought forward by defense counsel.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 54 of 348
SA-54
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page56 of 258

Lourie followed up his email to Villafaña with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated 
the potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafaña believed “the best 
thing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . . .  The 
[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 20 year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two 
conspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”43  
Menchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can 
discuss after that.”   
Later that afternoon, Villafaña sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel, 
explaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the 
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be 168 to 210 months, and that in her view, the facts warranted 
an upward departure from that range.  Villafaña told OPR that although Lourie proposed some 
changes to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient 
to support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case. 
In an email to Acosta and Menchel on May 11, 2007, Lourie recommended charging 
Epstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea: 
My current thoughts are that we should charge him.  Not sure that I 
agree with the charging strategy as it is now, but at this point I think 
we only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover 
the conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.  
I think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some 
of the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree.  We can 
decide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely 
and which victims should be charged. 
I also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a 
complaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants 
a pre-indictment resolution.  That would give us more control [over] 
a plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss 
counts.  We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a 
plea attractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we 
try to dismiss indicted counts. 
Although her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafaña 
was unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.  
She continued preparing to charge Epstein.  Two weeks after submitting the prosecution 
memorandum, on May 14, 2007, Villafaña informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein 
was flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges 
the next day.  Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrow,” 
and explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-town conference, 
adding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure 
Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, the general 
“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 55 of 348
SA-55
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page57 of 258

he is comfortable before proceeding.”  Menchel told Villafaña he had “trouble understanding” why 
she was in a “rush” “given how long this case has been pending.”44    
OPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing 
the prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges.  Acosta and Menchel believed Villafaña’s 
timeline was unrealistic from the start.  Acosta told OPR that Villafaña was “very hard charging,” 
but her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.”  Menchel described Villafaña 
as “out over her skis a little bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.45  
Menchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about 
whether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision.  Menchel 
told OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision 
on.”  Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed 
charges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the 
facts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.”  Lourie told 
OPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”   
Villafaña continued to seek direction from her managers.  On May 15, 2007, she emailed 
Sloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will 
not do any good.  Am I right about that?”  Sloman responded, “Yes.”  On May 21, 2007, three 
weeks after submitting the prosecution memorandum, Villafaña emailed Sloman and Menchel 
asking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed–i.e., approval of an indictment something 
like the current draft, a complaint to allow for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment 
drastically different from the current draft?”  Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”46  
D. 
Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which 
Villafaña Opposes 
Meanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the 
federal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta.  In a May 10, 
2007 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s attorneys “want me to tell them the statutes 
Villafaña explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:  
“In terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars.  That was our 
time concern.”  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not recall Villafaña offering this explanation to him.  OPR 
notes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafaña 
expressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events.  When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those 
conflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the 
testimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.   
Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafaña was “ahead of where the office was internally” and 
that caused “discontent” between Villafaña and Menchel.  Villafaña was not the only one, however, who was surprised 
that the indictment was not approved immediately.  The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed” 
after Villafaña submitted the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum towards an indictment abated.  Villafaña’s 
immediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”  
However, Menchel rebuked Villafaña in his July 5, 2007 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing 
charges in] this matter was a foregone conclusion.”    
Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he 
had spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.

we are contemplating so Dershowitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”47  Lourie told Menchel, “I 
don’t see the downside,” but added, “Marie is against it.”  Menchel responded that it was 
“premature” to provide the information.  During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically 
recall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information, 
but speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for 
Acosta to have made a decision about how he wanted to proceed.  This recollection is consistent 
with the May 2007 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.   
On May 22, 2007, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a letter to “confirm” that 
Epstein’s attorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached 
a final decision on charging Epstein.  Lourie forwarded the letter to Menchel and Sloman, but 
noted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting 
with him.  Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex 
would be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.”  Lourie also emailed 
Lefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges, 
and suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.   
Although Lourie’s emails show that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers 
meeting with defense counsel, Villafaña opposed such a meeting.  Several emails indicate that 
Menchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafaña on the afternoon of 
May 23, 2007.48  On that same date, Villafaña drafted an email, which she planned to send to 
Sloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel.  Although 
the email was written for Sloman and Menchel, Villafaña sent it as a draft only to her immediate 
supervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to how to proceed.   
Hi Jeff and Matt – I just want to again voice my disagreement with 
promising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or 
any other of Epstein’s attorneys.  As I mentioned, this is not a case 
where we will be sitting down to negotiate whether a defendant will 
serve one year versus two years of probation.  This is a case where 
the defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison 
time.  Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than 
they would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case 
differently.  Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed 
at the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed 
at a future meeting.  
My co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the 
rest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of 
some of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting.  We 
have been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our 
Dershowitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.   
During her OPR interview, Villafaña could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose 
was to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel.  Menchel, similarly, 
told OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 57 of 348

opposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case 
as a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as 
a white collar or public corruption case where the parties can 
amicably work out a light sentence.49 
With respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss, 
those were already raised in his letter (which is part of the indictment 
package) and during his meeting with Andy and myself.  Those 
reasons are:  (1) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability 
to prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and 
(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be 
prosecuted at all.  Unless the Office thinks that any of those 
arguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the 
prosecution, it will only benefit the defense.  With respect to 
Lefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been 
provided.  The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the 
defense the other charges that we are considering.  In my opinion 
this would seriously undermine the prosecution. 
The defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the 
investigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation, 
and to use political pressure to stop the investigation. 
I have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to 
meet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case 
will be disclosed.  However, if you all do decide to go forward with 
these meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then 
I will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in 
agreement with the handling of the case. 
After receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafaña, “Let’s talk before 
this is sent, please.”50  Villafaña told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafaña not to send the 
email to Sloman or Menchel because Villafaña could be viewed as insubordinate.  She also told 
Villafaña that if Villafaña did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would 
never serve a day in jail.”     
Villafaña told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file 
charges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.  She 
also told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going down the same path that 
the State Attorney’s Office had gone down.”  Villafaña believed the purpose of the defense request 
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a 
defendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel 
to discuss the merits of a case.   
The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafaña that she and Villafaña were “not driving the ship,” and 
once “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”

for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t 
want to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a 
misguided belief “that [Epstein’s] attorneys would not engage in this behavior.”  Villafaña told 
OPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s 
behavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was 
a need to move with necessary speed.”  Nonetheless, Villafaña followed the guidance of her 
immediate supervisor and did not send the email.    
Like Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good 
practice.  Menchel told OPR that he saw “no downside” to hearing the defense point of view.  
Defense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or 
alternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and 
Menchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.  
Menchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafaña ever articulating a concern that Epstein was 
continuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in 
Florida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those 
circumstances. 
E. 
June 2007:  Villafaña Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum  
While Villafaña’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed 
charges, Villafaña took additional steps to support them.  On June 14, 2007, she supplemented the 
prosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of 
the victims.  In the email transmitting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her 
immediate supervisor, Villafaña reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,” 
and the “different strategies” about how to structure the charges left Villafaña unsure whether “to 
make . . . changes now or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”  
The addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most 
frequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein 
assistant.  In the addendum, Villafaña identified documents she had found corroborating four 
separate statements made by this victim.   
Villafaña told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated 
specific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum.  Lourie told OPR that he had 
no specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum 
addressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any 
other victim.  Villafaña’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the 
discussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.   
F. 
The June 26, 2007 Meeting with Defense Counsel  
Menchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2007, communicating directly 
with Sanchez about the arrangements.  At Menchel’s instruction, on June 18, 2007, Villafaña sent 
a letter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”51  
Villafaña sent copies of this letter to both Menchel and Sanchez.  Villafaña told OPR that she objected to 
sending this information to the defense.  Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafaña to send the letter to 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 59 of 348
SA-59
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page61 of 258

On that same day, Villafaña emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor 
complaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed 
indictment and asking again for feedback.  During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that 
Villafaña’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody 
else,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue.  Sloman told OPR that he did not 
know whether Villafaña received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in 
time, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about how to proceed. 
The day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmitted to the USAO a 
19-page letter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present 
in order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the 
conduct at issue here.”  Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly 
contested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the matter.  Among other issues, Lefcourt’s 
letter argued: 
x Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults–16 or 17 years of age”–was 
“strictly a state concern.” 
x Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant 
reasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was 
years of age. 
x One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was 
intended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet 
trolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims. 
x The “travel” statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of” 
engaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family, 
oversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of 
daily living.” 
Lefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a 
significant impact on any federal prosecution.”52 
Lourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafaña, an email dividing the defense arguments 
into “weaker” and “stronger” points.  Lourie disagreed with the argument that 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) 
was limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible 
for federal interest.”  On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not 
travel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.  
Lefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafaña’s claim that he had done so.   Menchel also told 
OPR that he did not recall Villafaña objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.      
Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and 
omissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit.  As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable 
cause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied 
knowledge of any videotaping.”  (Emphasis in original).  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 60 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page62 of 258

Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal 
high school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported 
the conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole 
purpose.  However, Lourie expressed concern about “getting to the jury” on this issue and noted 
that he had not found a legal case factually on point.  Villafaña told OPR that she disagreed with 
Lourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the matter with him.53  Villafaña 
also recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered 
“particularly weak.”    
On June 26, 2007, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafaña, the case agent, and the West Palm 
Beach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein attorneys Dershowitz, Black, 
Lefcourt, and Sanchez.  Dershowitz led the defense team’s presentation.  From the USAO 
perspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”54  Echoing the arguments made in 
Lefcourt’s letter, Dershowitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case 
because these were “traditionally state offenses.”  The case agent recalled being uncomfortable 
that the defense was asking questions in an attempt to gain information about the federal 
investigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been 
involved.   
Villafaña told OPR that when Epstein’s attorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be 
“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.”  But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey 
obviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.”  According 
to Villafaña, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie 
expressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general 
credibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense 
presentation had not been persuasive.  Villafaña told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the 
impression that we were continuing towards” filing charges. 
IV. 
ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO 
RESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
USAO internal communications show that in July 2007, Acosta developed, or adopted, the 
broad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation.  The agreement would 
leave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would 
accomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors:  Epstein’s incarceration; his 
registration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary 
Villafaña also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove 
Epstein’s knowledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were 16 or 17 at the time they provided 
massages.     
In his written response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26, 
2007 meeting.  In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had little memory of the meeting, to the best of 
his recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel 
opined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their 
position.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 61 of 348
SA-61
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page63 of 258

damages.55  During a two-month period, the subject attorneys were involved to varying degrees in 
converting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on 
September 24, 2007.  The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both 
the larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of 
conceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution.  However, the contemporaneous emails 
and other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their 
deliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear.  In particular, Menchel 
and Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but 
neither had a clear memory of their conversations.  Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the 
facts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.      
In the following account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal 
investigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous 
communications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA.  OPR 
questioned each of the subjects about how the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution, 
and OPR includes below the subjects’ explanations.  The subjects’ memories of particular 
conversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus 
emerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the 
willingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the 
case that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail 
at trial and through appeal.  In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority 
to prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors.  Based 
on this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve 
the matter through a state plea.  In any event, Acosta acknowledged to OPR that, at a minimum, 
he approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations 
and the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum.  
Furthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.  
A. 
June – July 2007:  The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the 
Defense Rejects 
A few days after the June 26, 2007 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafaña, advising her that 
Epstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July 11, 2007, and hoped 
“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”56  In a July 3, 2007 email, Villafaña 
told Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea 
discussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could 
State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allow 
law enforcement and the public to know the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and, 
in some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.  The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry 
is administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act 
of 2006 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration 
and Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen 
the nationwide network of sex offender registrations. 
In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands 
for records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before 
the October 2005 state search warrant and that Villafaña had been requesting from the defense since late 2006.    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 62 of 348

include concurrent time.”  The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafaña did not 
explain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.57  Villafaña requested to be advised, 
“[i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s attorneys that is contrary to this.”  Villafaña, 
who was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the 
case, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the 
defense attorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions 
about a possible plea.   
In response to Villafaña’s email, Menchel notified Villafaña that he had told Sanchez “a 
state plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Attorney],” but Sanchez 
had responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”58  During his OPR interview, Menchel had no 
independent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense 
deemed the proposal a “non-starter.”  However, Menchel explained that he would not have made 
the proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knowledge.  He also pointed out that in numerous emails 
before the June 26, 2007 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he 
wanted to do with the Epstein case.  Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember 
a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have 
discussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”   
1. 
Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based 
Resolution 
Subsequent events showed that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was 
pivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning.  In his OPR interview, Acosta 
explained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution.  Acosta 
said that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did 
what he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in 
terms of testimony.”59  Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about how the 
victims would “do on the stand.” 
Acosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether, 
because the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.  
Villafaña explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a 
substantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a 
recommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein] 
would receive credit for time in state custody towards his federal release date.”  See n.65 for an explanation of the 
Ashcroft Memo.  
Villafaña was then in trial and on July 4, 2007, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafaña responded 
to defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a 
federal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”       
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or 
deciding how to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in 
reaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA.  However, Sloman also told OPR that he had little 
recollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and 
Menchel.

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page65 of 258

[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so 
here is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign . . . 
state, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind . . . the 
whole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state . . . 
is an independent entity, and that we should presume that what 
they’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except 
in the most unusual of circumstances.   
Acosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have 
become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis.  As Acosta 
explained in a public statement he issued in 2011, “the federal responsibility” in this unique 
situation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no 
miscarriage of justice.”60  Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as 
a federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the 
federal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate.  In the latter 
circumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”61  Acosta 
explained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice.  But it was his understanding 
that if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable 
offense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be 
viewed as a manifest injustice. 
Acosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result 
in unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or 
“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was 
an emerging matter of federal interest.  Acosta contended that in 2006, “it would have been 
extremely unusual for any United States Attorney’s Office to become involved in a state 
solicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of 
state prosecutors.”  Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least 
some individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking 
case.”  Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal 
might result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.   
Acosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s 
victims.  In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2007 might have permitted “victim shaming,” 
which would have been traumatic for them.  In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned 
a one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the 
state grand jury found little merit to the case.62  Acosta told OPR: 
Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at 1 (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The 
Daily Beast.  
Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allowing the presumption that a prior state prosecution 
has vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate 
in light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated 
federal prosecution.”  USAM § 9-2.031.D.   
Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Attorney’s Office had 
deliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.  Menchel told OPR that he understood that the State 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 64 of 348
SA-64
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page66 of 258

I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the 
shoes of the thought process in 2006 and ’07 when trafficking 
prosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some 
jurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s 
tolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation 
on the part of victims . . . .63 
Finally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning 
a sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district 
court in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence 
that differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.64  
In summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR, 
The way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing 
enough.  It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for 
registration, and then you had the restitution issue.  There were legal 
issues . . . . There were witness issues.  And . . . we could go to trial 
. . . and we may or may not prevail.  Alternatively, we could look at 
a pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went 
back and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a 
state pre-indictment resolution.  
Acosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in 
part, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution 
rather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.”  Acosta explained 
that he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the 
Epstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because 
the defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.   
Attorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand 
jury because the State Attorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or 
proceeding on a lesser charge.   
Menchel told OPR, however, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were 
generally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”     
Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule 11 is not something that [South 
Florida federal district] judges tend to do.”  Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District 
of Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule 
11(c) pleas.”  
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of 
a plea agreement.  The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court 
does not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void.  Villafaña told OPR that Rule 11(c) pleas 
were “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to 
impose.”  Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as 
averse to Rule 11(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.  Villafaña told OPR that she had never offered 
a Rule 11(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 65 of 348
SA-65
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page67 of 258

Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his 
own “emails . . . make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.”  He 
referenced, among others, his May 14, 2007 email to Villafaña informing her that Acosta was 
deciding how he wanted to handle the case.  Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished 
two things that Acosta viewed as important:  first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and 
second, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have allowed.  Menchel 
told OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and 
that any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration.  He 
told OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you know, it’s not that big a deal.  That was 
not the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.”  Rather, Menchel said, 
“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.” 
2. 
July 2007:  Villafaña and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State 
Resolution  
Villafaña told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining 
that he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea.  In 
Villafaña’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond” 
to Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable 
offense.”65  In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy.  Villafaña 
also told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative 
agency about plea negotiations, and Villafaña did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state 
plea.  Villafaña also believed the CVRA required attorneys for the government to confer with 
victims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.  
Villafaña told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation 
who had negative impressions of the State Attorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them 
back to the State Attorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.   
This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2003 memorandum from then Attorney General John Ashcroft 
regarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing” 
(known as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:  
[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the 
most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts 
of the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, United States 
Attorney, or designated supervisory attorney in the limited circumstances 
described below.  The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the 
most substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory 
minimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a 
longer sentence.  A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good 
faith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily 
to prove a charge at trial.  Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert 
leverage to induce a plea.  Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges 
may not be dismissed except to the extent permitted [elsewhere in this 
Memorandum].

In light of these concerns, Villafaña emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement 
with the process: 
[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without 
consulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more 
inappropriate to make a plea offer that you know is completely 
unacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement], the victims, and me.  These plea negotiations violate 
the Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Attorney[s’] Manual, and all of the 
various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.  Strategically, 
you have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position 
of weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the 
defense that we will demand no federal conviction.  We left the 
meeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered, 
and your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes 
away that advantage.  If you make it seem like the U.S. Attorney 
doesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to 
make a deal.   
Second, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for 
“show” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with 
Epstein’s attorneys directly. . . . 
. . . . 
I would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Attorney, Jeff 
[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation 
and a revised indictment.  The presentation will address the points 
raised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength 
of the case. 
In the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s 
counsel to me. 
Menchel told OPR he realized Villafaña was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.  
Villafaña had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not 
unsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case.  However, as Menchel told OPR, 
Villafaña’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a little bit more dispassionate,” and 
her urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position.  Menchel viewed the tone of Villafaña’s 
email as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect.  In 
particular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge 
the “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S. 
Attorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive 
the policy.

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page69 of 258

Menchel’s reply email began with a rebuke: 
Both the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate 
and, in combination with other matters in the past, it seriously calls 
your judgment into question. 
As you well know, the US Attorney has not even decided whether 
to go forward with a prosecution in this matter, thus you should have 
respected his position before engaging in plea negotiations. 
Along that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you 
made to the agents in this matter, it was made clear to you by the US 
Attorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first 
authorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns 
about taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of 
legal issues.  Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros 
memo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.  
It has come to my attention that you led the agents to believe that 
the indictment of this matter was a foregone conclusion and that our 
decision to put off that date and listen to the defense attorneys’ 
concerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about 
indicting.  As you well knew, you were never given authorization 
by anyone to seek an indictment in this case.66   
In the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with 
Sanchez and respond to Villafaña’s complaints:   
Lilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting.  It 
was an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea 
offer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take 
to resolve the matter.  As you are also well aware, the only reason 
why this office even agreed to look into the Epstein matter in the 
first instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an 
adequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights.  As you and the 
agents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that 
resulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI 
nor our office ever would have interceded.  You should also know 
that my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US 
Attorney’s full knowledge.  Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in 
pursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all 
the interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.  
In any event, I fail to see how a discussion that went nowhere has 
hurt our bargaining position.  I am also quite confident that no one 
Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie.

on the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this 
matter has been for show. 
Nor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the 
USAM or any other policy well taken.  As Chief of the Criminal 
Division, I am the person designated by the US Attorney to exercise 
appropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are 
appropriate and consistent with the Ashcroft memo and the USAM 
– not you. 
As for your statement that my concerns about this case hurting 
Project Safe Childhood are unfounded, I made it clear to you that 
those concerns were voiced by the US Attorney.67  Whether or not 
you are correct, matters of policy are always within his purview and 
any decisions in that area ultimately rest with him. 
Finally, you may not dictate the dates and people you will meet with 
about this or any other case.  If the U.S. Attorney or the First 
Assistant desire to meet with you, they will let you know.  Nor will 
I direct Epstein’s lawyers to communicate only with you.  If you 
want to work major cases in the district you must understand and 
accept the fact that there is a chain of command – something you 
disregard with great regularity. 
Villafaña acknowledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to 
deviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable 
offense.  She disagreed, however, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta 
and Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that 
meeting.68  Villafaña told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel 
mentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.69     
A week later, Villafaña replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the 
process and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward: 
Hi Matt -- My trial is over, so I now have [ ] time to focus back on 
this case and our e-mail exchange.  There are several points in your 
Neither Menchel nor Villafaña could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring.  In commenting 
on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with 
serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of 
trafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”  
Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.   
Villafaña characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her] 
place” by him.  She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”  
Menchel, however, asserted to OPR that Villafaña had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted 
his strong response.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 69 of 348

e-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address 
where we are in the case. 
First, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of 
command.  After that concern was brought to my attention several 
months ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of 
command. . . .  If there is a particular instance of violating the chain 
of command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to 
discuss it with you. 
. . . . 
The statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding 
the prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the 
frustration in the tone of my e-mail.  For two and a half months I 
have been asking about what that position is.  I have asked for 
direction on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are 
other issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether 
there is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc.  None of 
that direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims, 
and agents all demanding to know why we aren’t presenting an 
indictment.  Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of 
yours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not know to 
whom I should address my frustration.  My recollection of the 
original meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your 
summary.  In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State 
Attorney’s Office’s handling of it.  I acknowledged that we needed 
to do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and 
I noted the time and money that would be required for an 
investigation.  I said that I was willing to invest that time and the 
FBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the 
end and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-powered 
lawyers.  I was assured that that would not happen.  Now I feel like 
there is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while 
evidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this 
criminal behavior.  Additionally, the FBI has identified two more 
victims.  If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to 
give hope to more girls. 
As far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone 
conclusion, I don’t know of any case in the Office where an 
investigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict.  And I 
have never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a 
declination.  I didn’t treat this case any differently.  I worked with 
the agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment 
package that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of 
crimes have been committed.  More importantly, I believe there is 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 70 of 348
SA-70
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page72 of 258

proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.  
Lastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Attorney 
or anyone else.  I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting, 
asking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense 
attorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office.  With 
respect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say 
that disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the 
forgotten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified 
as a lapse in judgment.  This Office should seek to foster spirited 
debate about the law and the use of prosecutorial discretion . . . . 
[M]y first and only concern in this case (and my other child 
exploitation cases) is the victims.  If our personality differences 
threaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case 
whom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights. 
In the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to 
begin preparing a revised indictment package containing your 
suggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by 
Epstein’s attorneys. . . .  If there are any specific issues that you or 
the U.S. Attorney would like to see addressed, please let me know.70 
Villafaña did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested.  She viewed Menchel’s 
message as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even 
though she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise 
her concerns.71  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafaña to refrain from 
raising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafaña 
foreclosed her from meeting with Acosta.  Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running 
roughshod over the U.S. Attorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process.  You’re not 
in charge of it.  I’m not in charge of it.  [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”  Acosta, who was apparently 
not aware of Villafaña’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective, 
Villafaña was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him 
directly for a meeting.   
B. 
Villafaña Attempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from 
Epstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts 
As the USAO managers considered in July 2007 how to resolve the federal investigation, 
one item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer 
equipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant.  Although 
Villafaña took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.   
Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.   
Villafaña told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafaña, but that 
Menchel responded it was not Villafaña’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 71 of 348
SA-71
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page73 of 258

Early in the federal investigation, Villafaña recognized the potential significance of 
obtaining the missing computer equipment.  Villafaña told OPR that she and the FBI agents went 
through every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as 
child pornography.  Nevertheless, Villafaña told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein 
used hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed 
he could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home.  In addition, the computer 
equipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements 
about visiting Epstein’s home.  More generally, in Villafaña’s experience, individuals involved in 
child exploitation often possessed child pornography.72  Villafaña’s co-counsel, who had 
substantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a 
billionaire.  We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his 
capabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.   
As the investigation continued, Villafaña took various steps to acquire the computer 
equipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.  As noted previously in this Report, in 
her initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he 
computers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs, 
floppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence.  Although Lourie subsequently 
narrowed the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.  
The defense, however, failed to comply with the request.   
Villafaña learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular 
individual.  After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section 
and Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer 
equipment, Villafaña described her plan in an email to Menchel.  She asked Menchel for any 
comments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR 
that he did not recall Villafaña’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.  
In May 2007, following the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafaña initiated action 
requiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.  In her email to Villafaña on 
June 29, 2007, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based 
resolution” to the case would soon be reached.73  Villafaña advised her supervisors of the request, 
and responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”  
Nonetheless, Villafaña eventually agreed to an extension. 
Meanwhile, Epstein attorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafaña, demanding to know 
whether Villafaña had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer 
In addition, Villafaña became aware that in August 2007, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated 
that she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of 
the girls.   
This email led Villafaña to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible 
resolution of the case, which resulted in Villafaña’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of 
the case.   See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 72 of 348

equipment.74  After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafaña, and 
Lourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the 
USAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained below, never happened 
because the parties entered into the NPA. 
C. 
July 2007:  The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation 
In addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment, 
defense counsel also sent letters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2007, and July 25, 2007, reiterating 
their objections to a federal investigation of Epstein.  The July 25, 2007 letter included a lengthy 
“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had committed no 
federal offense.  The July 25 letter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former 
Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that 
this is not a matter upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”75   
While the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS 
expressed its endorsement of Villafaña’s legal analysis and proposed charges.  On July 18, 2007, 
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read 
Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job.  As we 
opined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis.  Her charging 
decisions are legally sound.”  Oosterbaan observed: 
I have also reviewed the arguments contained in the letters from 
defense counsel.  Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive, 
but I find none of their arguments persuasive.  That is not to say that 
all the arguments are completely devoid of merit.  I expect the judge 
to consider some of the arguments closely.  Nevertheless, while the 
law applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of 
available precedent favors us.  From the prosecution memorandum 
it is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments, 
scrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.  
And, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a 
strong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth 
facing.  I also happen to know that there is absolutely no concern . . . 
about facing the challenges this case presents. 
In closing, Oosterbaan renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to 
send “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.   
Villafaña forwarded Black’s letter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the 
computer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the 
Department, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.   
The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email 
exchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterbaan, who commented, “By the way, let me know if you want me 
to put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised 
with similar facts.”

D. 
Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of 
Incarceration 
The next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-
year term of imprisonment.  Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would 
accept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with 
the result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued.  The 
contemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years 
as the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able 
to recall how the decision was made.  As discussed below, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation, 
but OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.76      
While the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to 
Villafaña, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafaña continued moving toward filing charges.  On 
July 19, 2007, the day after receiving Oosterbaan’s email supporting a potential prosecution, 
Villafaña emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps 
regarding three of Epstein’s assistants.  However, Menchel directed Villafaña to “hold off . . . until 
we decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next 
week.”  Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafaña to wait, but 
he assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.   
On Monday, July 23, 2007, Menchel submitted a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that 
he would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2007.77   
1. 
The July 26, 2007 Meeting in Miami 
Early on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2007, Villafaña informed Menchel that she was 
preparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all 
but three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt 
acts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, however, have the revised 
indictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:00 p.m. meeting.  Menchel told OPR 
that the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafaña to 
delay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something” 
with the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed 
with federal charges.  
Acosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2007.  On that afternoon, Villafaña met in 
Miami with Menchel.  She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their 
supervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone.  Villafaña told OPR that 
she expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the 
investigation.  However, Villafaña told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered 
the room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.”  According to 
See Section IV.D.2 in this Part. 
As early as May 4, 2007, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter 
private practice.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 74 of 348
SA-74
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page76 of 258

Villafaña, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafaña “shocked and 
stunned.”   
Menchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2007 meeting.  Nonetheless, he 
strongly disputed Villafaña’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at 
odds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and 
leave without discussion.  Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at 
some point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision 
at the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s 
relaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to 
do so.  Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting.  The FBI case agent recalled attending a 
meeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafaña, 
Lourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed how to proceed with the 
Epstein case.  According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be 
registered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court 
had ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.   
Regardless of exactly how Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was 
communicated to Villafaña and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the 
specific term, the record shows that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a 
resolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknowledged.78   
2. 
The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence 
with a Two-Year Term of Incarceration 
Villafaña asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the 
decision was made.79  Villafaña told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and 
none of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view, 
explained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence.  Villafaña also told OPR that 
Menchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2007 meeting, and Villafaña 
did not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.  
Villafaña described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines 
people, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines.  There’s no way to get 
to 24 months with this set of offenses.”80   
OPR notes that Villafaña did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors setting forth her views and 
objections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made 
to offer a two-year term of incarceration.  Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and 
Villafaña, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a 
decision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting. 
OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafaña had knowledge of Acosta’s 
decision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2007 meeting at which she said she learned of it.       
From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in 1987, they have been the mechanism for 
calculating federal criminal sentences.  Since 2005, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are 
required to consider them.  As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.710, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 75 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page77 of 258

Sloman also told OPR that he did not know how the decision to offer a two-year plea offer 
was reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from 
Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña.  He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an 
assessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.81  Sloman added 
that he did not know how a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either 
state or federal sentencing guidelines.  Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall how the two-year 
term was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the 
defense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by 
Acosta following “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman, 
Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña.82 
Menchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or 
who reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence.  Menchel also told OPR, 
however, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges, 
Epstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take 
the case to trial.  Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial, 
and in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to 
testify.  Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as 
a fair result in terms of the conduct.  I think that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not 
if we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have 
gotten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.” 
Acosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some 
point,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a 
week or two.”  As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely 
as a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[, 
‘]encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[’]”83  Acosta said that he understood two years’ 
imprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the 
PBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.84  Acosta also told OPR that he 
the attorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in 
its determination of the sentence to be imposed.  The prosecutor must be familiar 
with the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable 
to his or her case.  In discharging these duties, the attorney for the government 
should . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information 
upon which the sentencing decisions will be based. 
In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.   
Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front 
office who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”    
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a little 
bit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case.  Acosta’s attorney 
also asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially 
more onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the 
State to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”      
OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment 
corresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 76 of 348
SA-76
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page78 of 258

understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had 
pursued the appropriate charges.  In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly, 
an analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what 
is the appropriate federal outcome to that.”  Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his 
concerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific 
conversation with them. 
E. 
Villafaña Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential 
Agreement with the Defense 
A meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 31, 2007.  Villafaña told 
OPR that between July 26 and July 30, 2007, she had “some sort of discussion” with her 
supervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for 
resolving the federal investigation through state charges.  Sometime during that period, Villafaña 
left a voicemail message for Menchel.  During their OPR interviews, neither Villafaña nor 
Menchel could recall what Villafaña said in that message.  On July 30, 2007, Menchel emailed 
Villafaña: 
I received your voicemail this morning.  I don’t see any reason to 
change our approach.  I think telling them that unless the state 
resolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and 
the interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys 
that we are serious.  While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the 
past that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite 
these terms before.  In any event, this is the course of action that the 
US Attorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.   
The following day, July 31, 2007, Villafaña emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein 
Non-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie.  Villafaña told OPR she had never 
before seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign” 
to her.85  Villafaña told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein 
the state indictment.  OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found 
no obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.   
Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for 
resolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities.  A 2008 Departmental memorandum explained:  
The terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement” 
have often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and 
commentators.   As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution 
of Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically 
predicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and 
the agreement is filed with the appropriate court.  In the non-prosecution 
agreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained 
by the parties rather than being filed with a court.  Clear and consistent use of 
these terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best 
practices and to track the use of such agreements.  These Principles do not apply 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 77 of 348
SA-77
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page79 of 258

as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated 
that terminology to her.  According to Villafaña, she asked that it include a mechanism for the 
victims to be provided monetary compensation through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution 
that would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.86  Acosta told 
OPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”   
Before the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from 
Villafaña’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified 
victims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the 
month.  The final term sheet was as follows: 
to plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a 
court proceeding.   
Memorandum from Acting Deputy Attorney General Craig S. Morford to Heads of Departmental Components and 
United States Attorneys at n.2 (Mar. 7, 2008), available at https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-
manual-163-selection-and-use-monitors.  Villafaña did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.  
A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal 
criminal code at 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2006, to  
March 6, 2013, provided as follows:  
Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section 
2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of 
this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless 
of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any 
appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such 
person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.  Any 
person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained 
damages of no less than $150,000 in value.   
Villafaña also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that 
required him to register as a sexual offender; however, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3, 
2007 email to Villafaña recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.

V.
THE USAO PRESENTS EPSTEIN WITH KEY TERMS OF A DEAL:  PLEAD 
GUILTY TO STATE CHARGES REQUIRING A TWO-YEAR TERM OF 
INCARCERATION AND SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION, AND AGREE 
TO A MEANS FOR THE VICTIMS TO OBTAIN MONETARY DAMAGES
Although the USAO term sheet was presented to Epstein’s defense team on July 31, 2007, 
it took almost another two months to reach a final agreement in the form of the NPA.  The 
contemporaneous emails show that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered 
multiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the 
state plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement.  The emails make clear 
that as the negotiations intensified in September 2007, the prosecutors became increasingly 
frustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and 
provisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.  
It is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 79 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page81 of 258

the period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two 
years in prison.”  The USAO did, however, consistently reject defense proposals to change other 
terms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.     
A. 
July 31, 2007:  The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which 
Makes a Counteroffer 
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafaña, and the case agents met with Epstein attorneys 
Lefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 31, 2007, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the 
USAO.87   The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafaña distributed a federal sentencing 
guidelines calculation showing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of 
188 to 235 months’ incarceration.    
Villafaña recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s attorneys opposed the requirement of 
sexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein 
serve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”88 in lieu of incarceration, and 
emphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.89  Villafaña told OPR 
that when Epstein’s attorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a 
state prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a 
federal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility.  A few days after the meeting, 
Villafaña emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-1/2 
year cap.”   
Although Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence 
show that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal 
Villafaña was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting. 
According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control, 
The Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to 
incarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program 
where you are confined to your home unless you are working, attending school, 
performing public service hours, participating in treatment or another special 
activity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was 
designed to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a 
punishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control 
supervision (also known as “house arrest”) you will not be allowed to leave your 
home to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation, 
or many of the other activities you are used to being able to do . . . , but it does 
allow you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or attend school 
in lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.

Succeeding-on-Community-Control.pdf. 
Villafaña told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of 
experience with the state system.  We did not.”  Villafaña anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state 
sentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with 
Lourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 80 of 348

charges in addition to state charges.  On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez followed up on the 
July 31, 2007 meeting with an August 2, 2007 letter to Menchel:  
We welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither 
appropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the 
state prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable.  We 
acknowledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal 
misdemeanors was an attempt to resolve this dilemma.  Our 
proposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we 
believe, leave little doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably 
vindicated.90 
Sanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never 
been arrested before.  He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”   
The “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense letter involved no period of 
mandatory incarceration.  Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular 
reporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court 
and probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service; 
psychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims.  The letter 
specifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed 
under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified 
group of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] – that is, the 12 individuals noted at the 
meeting on July 31, 2007.”  Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only 
if he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.  Sanchez also advised that the defense 
team was seeking a meeting with Acosta. 
B. 
In an August 3, 2007 Letter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of 
Imprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest 
Villafaña told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable, 
and she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response.  Villafaña drafted for 
Menchel’s signature a letter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment 
to be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.  
Villafaña’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not 
appropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allow Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation 
for a two-year term of incarceration.  Villafaña specified that Epstein would also be required to 
concede liability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal 
investigation, “not just the 12 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”   
The USAO countered, however, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that 
“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.”  Records show that throughout the 
Epstein matter, the USAO attorneys identified instances when defense attorneys misstated or otherwise did not 
accurately describe events or statements.  Accordingly, in evaluating the subject attorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely 
on uncorroborated defense assertions. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 81 of 348
SA-81
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page83 of 258

Menchel made several substantive changes to Villafaña’s draft letter.  He specified that “a 
two-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal 
interest in the case.  (Emphasis added.)  With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote 
that the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the reference to a 
Rule 11(c) plea.  Menchel also removed the reference to the specific state offenses to which Epstein 
would be required to plead guilty.  Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they 
speak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña. 
The final letter, as shown on the following pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except 
that it omitted all reference to a federal plea under Rule 11(c).91 
Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule 11(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges 
were generally averse to them.  He did not recall why the provision was dropped from the letter, but “assumed” it was 
a decision by Acosta.  In a September 6, 2007 email, Villafaña told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a 
Rule 11(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.”  Villafaña told OPR 
that Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule 11(c) plea.

Menchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for 
negotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more 
jail time rather than less.  Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by 
retaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him 
into a federal penitentiary.”  The letter’s deadline of August 17, 2007, for acceptance of the 
government’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafaña’s request that the deadline provide 
her with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s 
assistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if 
Epstein rejected the deal.  Menchel told OPR he considered August 17 to be a firm deadline:  “[I]f 
you tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.”  Menchel signed and sent the 
letter on Friday, August 3, 2007, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law 
firm.92
The following Monday, August 6, 2007, Villafaña contacted Menchel by email at his new 
firm to inquire whether the letter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.  Villafaña explained 
Menchel told OPR that the timing of the letter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do 
with his impending departure from the USAO. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 84 of 348
SA-84
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page86 of 258

to OPR that she “wanted to know whether this letter went out.  Because . . . if the letter didn’t go 
out we can make this all go away and restart.”  Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the letter 
out by email.   
Later that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood 
Epstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.  
Villafaña told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not 
to prosecute Epstein federally.  Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like 
[Villafaña] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”93 
C. 
August – September 2007:  Epstein Hires Additional Attorneys, Who Meet 
with Acosta 
1. 
Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Attorneys  
Villafaña told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with 
them and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer.  Around this time, 
Epstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkowitz, two prominent attorneys from the law 
firm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate 
at the firm.94  On the evening of August 6, 2007, Sloman emailed Acosta:  “Just saw Menchel.  I 
didn’t know Kirkland made a call into you.  You were right.  Unbelievable.”  During their OPR 
interviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could 
provide no additional information about the contact.95  A reply email from Acosta to Sloman 
indicates that the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys were considering elevating to the Department their 
objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein matter.  In that email, Acosta stated, “They 
are likely to go to DC.  We should strategize a bit.  We are not changing positions, and that should 
be made clear.”   
The next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman: 
[Epstein’s] attorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds 
of a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them.  I’m concerned 
that this will delay matters. 
I am thinking of heading this off, by (i) agreeing to meet to discuss 
general legal policy only (the only matter in which DC has arguable 
In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s 
a tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.”  The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not 
remember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the 
case and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict?  Why don’t we just move forward?”   
Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September 1995 to March 1997, he 
had worked on at least one matter each with Starr and Lefkowitz, and since that time, he had professional 
acquaintanceships with both.   
Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which 
he entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,” 
and told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.

jurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the 
details of the case, and (ii) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to 
participate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting. 
Thoughts? 
Acosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and 
that “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop 
this case.”96 
2. 
Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are 
Postponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaña’s Efforts to 
Obtain the Computer Evidence 
On August 8, 2007, Villafaña informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterbaan, who 
was willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after 
August 21, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August 17th 
deadline.”  Villafaña also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York 
and to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there.  Noting that “there was 
some concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a 
plea,” Villafaña asked Acosta for guidance.  Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that 
the USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.”  Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval 
authority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allow the defense to keep arguing this [case] to 
different agencies.”  Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhow, if we don’t 
meet with them.  I’d rather keep it here.  Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so.  If our 
deadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.” 
As a result, the investigative steps were postponed.  On August 10, 2007, Villafaña emailed 
Lourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could 
oppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain 
Epstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team.  Villafaña was 
reluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl 
who began seeing Epstein at age 14 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.  
On August 13, 2007, Villafaña advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of 
the litigation.  However, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2007, and obtained his 
agreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel, 
which was scheduled for September 7, 2007.    
Villafaña told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation 
concerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”97   Villafaña 
suspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”  
In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the 
NPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the 
case because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the matter.   
Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist 
“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 86 of 348

She believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating 
position, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.”  Villafaña said she did not 
understand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.  
Instead, they instructed Villafaña to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation 
proceedings.  
Sloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what 
the thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafaña was “ordered to stand 
down.”  Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafaña’s effort to 
obtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it.  Lourie, however, told 
OPR that the computers might have contained “very powerful evidence” that possibly “could have 
changed our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.”  In his OPR interview, Menchel was 
uncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknowledged to OPR, 
“You always want more as a prosecutor.” 
On August 31, 2007, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2007 meeting with 
defense counsel that he planned to attend, CEOS Chief Oosterbaan traveled to West Palm Beach 
to meet with Villafaña and the case agents and to examine the case file.  He explained to OPR that 
he wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the 
interests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.  
According to Villafaña, during his review of the file, Oosterbaan told her that the case was “really 
good” and offered to assist Villafaña at trial.   
On September 6, 2007, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent 
Villafaña an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection.  What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”  
Sloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was 
involved in “a hundred other things” at that time.98  Villafaña sent Sloman the term sheet and 
explained to him, “You and Matt [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an 
Information charging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I think Matt 
must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.”  Villafaña continued: 
There are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow.  First, 
that there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting 
because it is strategically important that we indict before the end of 
September, which means . . . September 25th.  Second, the agents 
and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which 
as Drew [Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the 
law.  And third, I do not want to make any promises about allowing 
Epstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good 
chance of getting him detained.99 
Sloman noted that with the attention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only 
case [in the office], but there were other cases.”   
As Villafaña explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government 
may have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond.  Contrary to Villafaña’s assertion in the email, 
the CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 87 of 348
SA-87
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page89 of 258

Villafaña added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would 
report that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to know if 
the victims had been consulted about the deal.”  Sloman forwarded Villafaña’s email to Acosta 
with a note that read simply, “fyi.”   
Later that evening, Villafaña circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterbaan two alternative 
documents:  a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.100  The draft federal plea agreement, 
following the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy 
under 18 U.S.C. § 371 to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration 
as a sexual offender, with a Rule 11(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment.  The draft 
NPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 31, 2007, and called for Epstein to 
enter a state plea by September 28, 2007.  Villafaña told OPR that because she had never seen a 
non-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the 
Department’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the 
use of non-prosecution agreements.101 
3. 
September 7, 2007:  Acosta, Other USAO Attorneys, and FBI 
Supervisors Meet with Epstein Attorneys Starr, Lefkowitz, and 
Sanchez 
On Friday, September 7, 2007, Acosta, Sloman, Villafaña, Villafaña’s co-counsel, 
Oosterbaan, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office 
with defense attorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkowitz.102  This was Acosta’s 
first meeting with Epstein’s defense team.  Villafaña understood the purpose of this meeting was 
to afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be 
prosecuted federally.  Villafaña recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived, 
Acosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case. 
Acosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to 
present their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism.  Villafaña 
similarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case 
should remain a state matter in which the USAO should not interfere.  Both Villafaña and her 
co-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held 
Senate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the 
only people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.”  Acosta did 
not recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going 
Chapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in matters in which 
the government did not pursue a federal charge.  The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the 
Department’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.         
100 
The initial draft NPA is attached as Exhibit 2 to this Report. 
101  
OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied. 
102  
Lourie was not present.  During September 2007, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C., 
as he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff to the head 
of the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher.  He served in that detail until he left 
the Department in February 2008.

forward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.  
The September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”103 
Villafaña told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the 
federal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required 
sexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the 
U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims.  When defense counsel 
objected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal 
for a sentence of home confinement.  In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterbaan reported 
that the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might 
approach Criminal Division Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument 
directly to her.  
VI. 
SEPTEMBER 2007:  THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE 
PROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED  
Acosta had dispensed with the August 17, 2007 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s 
August 3, 2007 letter, in order to allow the defense to meet with him.  After that meeting, and 
although Villafaña continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was 
established, and the negotiations continued through most of September.   
The defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions.  Because Acosta was 
not willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means 
through which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of 
imprisonment.  As the contemporaneous emails show, the USAO did not hold to its position that 
a two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept.  To reach an 
agreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either 
federal or state court, or both, and Villafaña spent considerable time and effort working with 
defense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes.  In the course of that 
process, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of 18 months, with 
the understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just 15 
months.      
A. 
The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 20 Months 
Shortly after the September 7, 2007 meeting, Epstein attorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had 
not been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer, 
proposing that Epstein serve 15 months in jail followed by 15 months in home confinement.  On 
the afternoon of Monday, September 10, 2007, Villafaña emailed Sloman, identifying issues she 
wanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a 
resolution that would allow Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender 
registration.  Villafaña stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light 
of our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really low sentence.”  Villafaña 
103  
Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the 
USAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 89 of 348
SA-89
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page91 of 258

noted that the revised charges involved 19 victims, so the defense proposal for a 15-month sentence 
amounted to less than one month per victim.  Villafaña requested that “whatever the U.S. Attorney 
decides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follow . . . a version of my written non-
prosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a 
strict timeline.” 
Later that day, Villafaña circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a 
20-month jail sentence to be followed by 10 months of home confinement.  This redrafted NPA 
contained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least  
months in a state correctional institution.”104  Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended 
it to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with 
the State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.”  Villafaña sent her version of the 
revised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the 
following day, after she learned of it.    
On September 11, 2007, the court contacted Villafaña to inquire whether the USAO would 
be prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the following day.  At 
Sloman’s direction, Villafaña asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for 
the following week.  At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafaña 
circulated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterbaan, seeking their feedback before 
sending it “through the chain of command.”  Villafaña also sent Oosterbaan the revised NPA and 
told him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the 
USAO’s offer.  Oosterbaan responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s 
understandable.”105   
That afternoon, Lourie asked Villafaña, “What is our latest offer?”  Villafaña responded, 
“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 30-month sentence, split 20 in jail and 10 in 
‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.  We also put in 
deadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”    
B. 
September 12, 2007:  The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State 
Attorney 
Although the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal 
investigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State 
Attorney’s Office in those discussions until September 12, 2007.  On that day, Lourie, Villafaña, 
and another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West 
Palm Beach office, and Epstein attorneys Lefkowitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State 
Attorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek.  Other than Villafaña, 
few of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it.  The available evidence 
indicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.   
104  
Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.   
105  
Oosterbaan told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement 
with it.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 90 of 348
SA-90
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page92 of 258

Villafaña told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did 
not think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek.  Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed 
concern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing.  According to Villafaña, Belohlavek 
explained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s 
sentencing guidelines, and that it would be better for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled 
guilty to just one of the three counts.  Villafaña recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that 
Epstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges, 
Lourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allow Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge 
in addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense attorneys selected the charge of 
procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.106  Lourie, however, disputed Villafaña’s 
recollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had 
the authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally.107   
During the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state 
prison.  Villafaña also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the 
meeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during 
the entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local 
facility.  Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county 
facility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than 12 months, so 
that, for example, consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months—totaling 18 months—could be 
served in the county jail.  Villafaña told OPR: 
Our thing was incarceration 24 hours a day.  So during this meeting, 
I remember [the defense] talking about . . . a one year count followed 
by a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to 
back but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.  
But then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round 
the clock incarceration.”  And Barry Krischer said yes.  And [he] 
said that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he 
would be kept in solitary confinement. 
Villafaña did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an 18-month sentence during that 
meeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allowing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county 
jail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.   
Neither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details 
of the September 12, 2007 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember 
the meeting at all.  Krischer did, however, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned 
of the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment 
and an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein 
“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was 
106  
Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not 
involve sexual offender registration.   
107  
As noted below, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafaña spoke 
with Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 91 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page93 of 258

going to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he 
hadn’t done up to this point.”  Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that down?”  Krischer also noted 
that at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that 
“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”108       
Acosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September 12 
meeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only 
one charge.  Acosta told OPR, however, that he recognized that Villafaña and Lourie needed “some 
degree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose 
a concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein 
ultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.     
Although Epstein’s attorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county 
facility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s attorneys alternatively expressed interest in 
Epstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state 
resolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence 
running concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.  
Later that day, Villafaña sent Lefkowitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with 
Acosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”109  The next day, 
September 13, 2007, Villafaña sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors, 
identifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence.  Villafaña also emailed 
defense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title 18”—referring 
to the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any 
federal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.   
C. 
The Evidence Does Not Clearly Show Why the Term of Incarceration Was 
Reduced from 24 Months to 20 Months to 18 Months 
OPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafaña, and Lourie to 
explain how the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to 18 
months.  Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was 
reduced.  Villafaña and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.   
Villafaña told OPR:   
We had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it 
going to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it 
going to be a federal charge?  And to get to a federal charge, there 
was no way to do 24 months that made any sense.  So somehow it 
ended up being 20 months and then it got to be 18 months.  And 
these were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkowitz was 
108  
Belohlavek, however, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated 
state crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.  
109  
The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 92 of 348
SA-92
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page94 of 258

having directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to 18 
months. 
Villafaña further explained to OPR: 
Regarding going from 24 months to 20 months, I recall a discussion 
that 24 months of federal time was really 20 months after gain time, 
so Epstein should be allowed to plead to 20 months’ in the state.  
Epstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like 
that in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed.  Later, of course, 
as shown in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkowitz) got 
Alex to agree that Epstein should be allowed to earn gain time in the 
[s]tate, so the 20 months in the state became at least 17 months.   
Regarding going from 20 months’ to 18 months, . . . this came from 
a negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where 
the federal statutory max could only be 24 or 18, so 18 was agreed 
to.  I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they 
wanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked 
Alex why we didn’t return to 20 months because the reason why we 
went to 18 months was because that was the only way to end up with 
a federal statutory maximum.110 
However, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s attorneys, 
drafted by Villafaña for Acosta several weeks after the September 12, 2007 meeting with the State 
Attorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction 
in the amount of jail time – from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months down to eighteen 
months, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.” 
Acosta also noted to OPR that Villafaña was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing 
to allow her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-
guessing” her.  Acosta acknowledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.” 
Based on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, how, or by whom the 
decision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to 18 months.  It 
is possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allow 
him to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ attempts 
to reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater 
than what had been discussed with respect to state charges.  In the end, the evidence shows that 
Acosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to 18 months, and the USAO 
understood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount 
of time Epstein would spend incarcerated.   
110  
By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafaña referred to 12-month and 6-month misdemeanors.

D. 
The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to 
Federal Charges 
During the remainder of September, Villafaña conducted plea negotiations and drafted the 
final NPA, mainly with Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz.  In a September 13, 2007 email to CEOS 
Chief Oosterbaan, Villafaña reported that the plea negotiations were “getting fast and furious.”  
She said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make 
payments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for 
damages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.” 
According to the email documentation, by Friday, September 14, 2007, the parties had 
moved toward a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which 
would allow Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.  
Villafaña informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkowitz 
had resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges:  harassment to 
prevent a witness from reporting a crime (18 U.S.C. § 1512(d)(2), which was then a one-year 
misdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5), a six-month 
misdemeanor).  Villafaña reported that Lefkowitz “put in a pitch for only 12 months, I put in a 
pitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 20-month recommendation, and we decided that we would 
be stuck with the 18 months.”   
Later that day, Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information 
mirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had 
“not yet been blessed” by them.  The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the 
two federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the 
statutory maximum penalty of 18 months’ imprisonment followed by 2 years of supervised release, 
and that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to 
engage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Attorney’s Office would make a joint, 
binding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 20 months in prison followed by 10 
months of community control (home confinement).  Although not specified in the draft agreement, 
the negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently.   In addition 
to payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the 
victims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 40—who 
elected to file suit for damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  A guardian ad litem would be appointed 
to communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf. 
Lourie, however, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal.  In response 
to Villafaña’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafaña sent the proposal to 
Lefkowitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of 
silly.”111  Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault 
charge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.”  Acosta responded, “If we 
need[,] let’s find a different charge.”  On Saturday, September 15, 2007, Villafaña emailed 
Lefkowitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “gotten some negative reaction 
111  
The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female 
assistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”

to the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.112  At 
this point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafaña that in his absence 
Lourie had agreed “to help finalize this.”  Lourie spent the following work week at his new post 
at the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone 
and email.  
In a Sunday, September 16, 2007 email, Villafaña informed Lefkowitz that she had drafted 
a factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal.  In that email, Villafaña 
also noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which 
will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.”  This email received considerable attention 12 
years later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of 
the USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims.  Villafaña, however, explained to OPR 
that she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy.  She told 
OPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into 
the courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity 
was less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens 
in Palm Beach.”     
Lefkowitz responded to Villafaña with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid” 
plea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.”  Significantly, this defense proposal 
introduced two new provisions.  The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly 
facilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme.  The defense sought a government promise not to 
prosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego 
immigration proceedings against two of the female assistants: 
Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also 
precludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might 
otherwise in the future be brought against [four named female 
assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate 
entity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal 
investigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be 
instituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the 
ongoing investigation.  
The second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers: 
Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement 
resolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested 
witness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or 
computers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the 
Agreement.  Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the 
execution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable 
112  
Villafaña told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring 
at nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a 
time when out of office access to email was very limited.”  Records show her supervisors were aware that at times she 
used her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 95 of 348
SA-95
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page97 of 258

evidence of a violation of the agreement.  Epstein and his counsel 
agree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will 
be safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or 
their agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are 
fulfilled. 
Later that day, Villafaña sent Lefkowitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had 
suggested:  “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an 18-month sentence, 
or pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges.  Villafaña also told 
Lefkowitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy 
with a Rule 11(c) binding recommendation for a 20-month sentence.  Villafaña explained: 
As to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be 
sentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but 
not that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his 
federal time.  Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be 
addressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the 
judge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison 
purposes.   
With regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafaña suggested standard 
federal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will 
mention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes 
and all of the other persons that we could charge.”  Villafaña told OPR that she was willing to 
include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood 
to be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in 
prosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea.  Villafaña told OPR, “[W]e considered 
Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone 
else.”  She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed 
individuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern.  Villafaña also told 
OPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge” 
related to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct, 
the court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been 
charged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s attorneys might claim the 
agreement was breached.113   
With regard to immigration, Villafaña told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any 
position in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that 
either of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had committed fraud in connection with 
their immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status.  So there wasn’t any reason 
113  
OPR understood Villafaña’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry 
into additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to 
influence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 96 of 348
SA-96
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page98 of 258

for them to be deported.”114  As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of 
having committed crimes, Villafaña told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal 
apart from actual prosecution. 
Villafaña concluded her email to Lefkowitz by expressing disappointment that they were 
not “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work 
on the agreement: 
Can I suggest that tomorrow we either meet live or via 
teleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick 
phone call, to hash out these items?  I was hoping to work only a 
half day tomorrow to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if 
necessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet.  If you want to meet 
“off campus” somewhere, that is fine.  I will make sure that I have 
all the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.115 
Villafaña told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkowitz away from the USAO because conducting 
negotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafaña wanted “to have a meeting where we sat down 
and just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel better if you 
go to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting. 
On the morning of Monday, September 17, 2007, the USAO supervisor who was taking 
over Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafaña for an update on 
the plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkowitz the previous 
afternoon.  Villafaña told the manager, “As you can see . . . there are a number of things in their 
last draft that were unacceptable.  All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”   
Shortly thereafter, Villafaña alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just 
spoken with Lefkowitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning towards a plea to state charges under 
a non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkowitz “our last version of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement.”  Acosta asked that Villafaña “make sure they know it[’]s only a 
draft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.”  Villafaña responded, 
“Absolutely.  There were a lot of problems with their last attempt.  They tried to re-open all the 
loopholes that I had sewn shut.”  Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz the draft NPA that she had provided 
to Lefcourt on September 11, 2007, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him] 
having to reinvent the wheel.”  She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations, 
noting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th 
[to bring charges] . . . , no matter what.”   
After receiving the draft NPA, Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to provide for his review a factual 
proffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f 
114  
According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the 
beginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of 
any foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.   
115  
Lefkowitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 97 of 348
SA-97
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page99 of 258

we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”  
Villafaña replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly 
accessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part 
of our case file.  It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request, 
but it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”116  Villafaña told 
OPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want 
people to believe him to have committed a variety of crimes.”  As she explained to OPR, Villafaña 
believed the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the 
victims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages. 
E. 
The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges 
Negotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September 18, 2007.  Responding to 
Villafaña’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkowitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge 
with a 12-month sentence, followed by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home 
detention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be 
served under community control.  Villafaña replied, “I know that the U.S. Attorney will not go 
below 18 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).”  Shortly 
thereafter, Villafaña emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager: 
Hi all – I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with 
Mr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution.  As I 
mentioned yesterday, I spent about 12 hours over the weekend 
drafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing 
factual proffers.  I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from 
them yesterday, which never arrived.  At that time, they were 
leaning towards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the 
time in state custody. 
Late last night I talked to Jay Lefkowitz who asked about Epstein 
pleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail 
time being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.  I 
told him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest 
of full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible 
because he will not be in Zone A or B.117  This morning Jay 
Lefkowitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get 
Mr. Epstein down to 14 months, then he thought he would be 
eligible. 
My response:  have him plead to two separate Informations.  On the 
first one he gets 12 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets 
116  
FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permitting the 
government to withhold the requested records.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552.  
117  
Sentences falling within Zones A or B of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines permit probation or confinement 
alternatives to imprisonment.

twelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run 
consecutively. 
I just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do 12 
months imprisonment instead. 
As you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing 
jail time.  I would like to send Jay Lefkowitz an e-mail stating that 
if we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrow at 5:00, 
negotiations will end.  I have selected tomorrow at 5:00 because it 
gives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are 
serious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish 
holiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I 
plan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review 
the indictment package. 
Do you concur? 
A few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that 
Lourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”118   
Within moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafaña, reporting that he 
had just spoken with Lefkowitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap) 
with nonbinding recommendation for 18 months.  When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state 
offenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community 
confinement.”  By reply email, Villafaña asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether 
they spoke. 
F. 
Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of 
the Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects 
Approximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with 
Lefkowitz, Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a revised draft plea agreement.  Despite the agreement Lourie 
believed he and Lefkowitz had reached that morning, Lefkowitz’s proposal would have resulted 
in a 16-month federal sentence followed by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of 
home detention.  Lefkowitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the 
USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration 
proceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.   
Villafaña circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other 
supervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were 
“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.”  Villafaña also pointed 
out that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines 
118  
The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-
forth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to 
have a direct conversation with Epstein.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 99 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page101 of 258

and had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can 
keep all of his information confidential.  I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was 
unacceptable to our office.”   Of even greater significance, in a follow-up email, Villafaña noted 
that the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and 
the entire provision relating to monetary damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.   
In the afternoon, Villafaña circulated her own proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first 
internally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the 18/12 split that Jay and 
Andy agreed to,” and then to Lefkowitz.  Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she 
included the following provision:  “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the 
defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal 
conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including 
but not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution. 
In her email to Lefkowitz, transmitting the plea agreement, Villafaña wrote:  
Could you share the attached draft with your colleagues.  It is in 
keeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative 
“deal.”  The U.S. Attorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the 
language, but he agrees with it in principle.  
. . . . 
[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:00. 
. . .  One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit down 
together in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna 
[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a 
signed document. 
Villafaña also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s 
attorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final 
approval.  Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations.  I’d rather leave it to you 
if that’s ok.”  Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was 
important for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in 
September, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think 
your trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.”  Villafaña told OPR, however, that she did not 
understand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she 
believed Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have 
an appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”119  Villafaña replied to Acosta’s 
119  
As noted throughout the Report, Villafaña’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions 
often differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.  Because it involved subjective interpretations of 
individuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them 
as an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.  See Chapter Two, Part Three, 
Section V.E.

message, “That is fine.  [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything down, we just 
want to get a final blessing.”   
Negotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September 19, 2007, with 
Villafaña and Lefkowitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the 
scheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms.   During that exchange, Villafaña 
made clear to Lefkowitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end: 
I hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by 
Monday.  I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this 
has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall 
apart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the 
negotiations.  I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page 
indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these 
negotiations.  There has to be an ending date, and that date is 
Monday. 
Early that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his 
new post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafaña to furnish him with the last 
draft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “18/12 
split” draft she had sent to Lefkowitz the prior afternoon.  After reviewing that draft, Lourie told 
Villafaña it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the 
USAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be 
in the plea agreement.  Villafaña told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence” 
of the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.”   Villafaña explained to OPR that she held 
this view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was 
resolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.” 
At 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkowitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea 
agreement showing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic] 
prosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.”  The defense 
redline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor 
counts of attempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state 
indictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of 
coercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.04 (without regard 
to age).  Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration.  Epstein 
would serve an 18-month sentence and a concurrent 60 months on probation on the state charges.  
The redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and 
replaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court.   It 
retained language proposed by Villafaña, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal 
criminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida 
growing out of any criminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this 
plea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants 
and the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration 
proceedings.  It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a 
presentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and 
withdraw all pending legal process.

G. 
Villafaña and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges 
That They “Try to Work It Out” 
In the late afternoon of Wednesday, September 19, 2007, Villafaña expressed her 
increasing frustration to her supervisors.  She emailed the defense redline version of the plea 
agreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions 
she had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into 
the agreement.”  (Emphasis in original).  Villafaña opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”  
Lourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”   
Lourie immediately emailed Acosta the following: 
I looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkowitz] and I must agree 
with Marie.  Based on my own conversations with him, his draft is 
out of left field.  He claims to orally agree to our terms and then 
sends us a document that is the opposite.  I suggest we simply tell 
him that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move 
forward with our case. 
Acosta replied: 
Why don’t we just call him.  Tell him 
1. 
You agree, and then change things. 
2. 
That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith.  Stop it or we’ll 
indict. 
3. 
Try to work it out. 
It seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what 
has to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics. 
Acosta explained to OPR that he recognized,  
[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact 
that you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make 
it less of a right position.  You tell them stop being annoying, you 
try to work it out, and if not, then you indict. 
In response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.”  He also forwarded to 
Acosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafaña had sent to 
Lefkowitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafaña earlier that 
afternoon.  
Meanwhile, Villafaña sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft 
message she proposed to send to Lefkowitz with her objections to the defense revisions, 
explaining, “I know that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 102 of 348
SA-102
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page104 of 258

everything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations 
until he sees the Indictment and shows up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.”  She suggested 
charging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense, 
superseding with additional charges and going to trial.  She complained that after seven weeks of 
negotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.”  Her proposed email to Lefkowitz detailed all of 
the objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these, 
there can be no plea agreement.”   
H. 
Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaña Sends a Final Version 
to the Defense 
The next day, Thursday, September 20, 2007, Villafaña emailed Assistant State Attorney 
Belohlavek and informed her: 
Our deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and 
arraignment in the federal system.  At this time, things don’t look 
promising anyway, but I will keep you posted.  In their latest draft, 
they changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from 
solicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to 
forcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense).  We will 
not budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a 
mutually acceptable agreement.  If that changes, I will let you know. 
Acosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid” 
federal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems 
very straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the 
defense.120  Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not 
typically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should 
only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.”121  Lourie forwarded the email 
to Villafaña with a transmittal message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.  
Please try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as 
final to Jay.”  Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafaña that he believed the defense would want 
to go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement.  When Villafaña 
sent the revised plea agreement to Lefkowitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the 
defense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to 
him on September 17, 2007, would control.   
120  
The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had 
substantially diverged.  
121  
The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the 
name of the U.S. Attorney.  In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an 
opportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go 
forward with it.”

I. 
The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA 
“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender 
Registration Requirement 
After having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement, 
by the afternoon of September 20, 2007, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties 
resumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.  
Through multiple emails and attempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other 
supervisors, defense attorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a 
state charge requiring sexual offender registration.     
After receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkowitz spoke with Villafaña.  She reported 
to Acosta and Lourie that Lefkowitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-
only agreement” and wanted until the middle of the following week to work out the details, but 
that she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrow [Friday] or we 
are [filing charges] on Tuesday.”   
Lefkowitz emailed Villafaña about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out 
that it called for a 20-month jail sentence followed by 10 months of community control, rather than 
months in jail and 12 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility” 
on the § 2255 procedure.  Villafaña responded: 
The 18 and 12 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is 
not a problem.  On the issue about 18 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to 
be miles apart.  Your most recent version not only had me binding 
the girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also 
promising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.  
I reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments 
on some of your other changes.  In the context of a non-prosecution 
agreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not 
pursuing charges against others.  However, as I stated on Sunday, 
the Office cannot and will not bind Immigration. 
Also, your timetable will need to move up significantly.  As [State 
Attorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office 
can put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you 
all before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day. 
Villafaña alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and 
that defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not 
concurrent state and federal.”  She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to 
[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”   
In response to Villafaña’s report of her conversation with Lefkowitz about the defense 
preference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of 
[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.”  Lourie emailed Acosta: 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 104 of 348
SA-104
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page106 of 258

I think Jay [Lefkowitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable 
offense.  Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us 
down in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an 
offense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and 
touted that we should be happy because it was registrable.  For that 
reason alone, I don’t think we should consider allowing them to 
come down from their own offer, either on this issue or on time of 
incarceration. 
Lefkowitz attempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafaña to return the 
call, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel.  Lourie 
instructed Villafaña, “U can tell [J]ay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.” 
On the morning of Friday, September 21, 2007, Villafaña emailed Acosta informing him 
that “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the 
charging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in 
the Miami office needed to review it.  Villafaña also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that 
morning to Lefkowitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required 
sexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek 
“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”   
That same morning, Epstein attorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations 
for several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only 
one issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that 
would assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign 
as soon as today.”  From his out-of-town vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who 
replied, “Enjo[y] vacation.  Working with [M]arie on this.”  Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s 
email to Lourie and asked, “Do you know what she’s talking about?”  Lourie responded that 
Sanchez “has not been in any negotiations.  Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”   
J. 
The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”  
Lefkowitz, in the meantime, sent Villafaña a revised draft NPA that proposed an 18-month 
sentence in the county jail, followed by 12 months of community control, and restored the 
provision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek 
reimbursement by filing suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255.”  This defense draft retained the 
provision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed 
employees of the specific Epstein-owned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any 
potential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.  
This language had evolved from similar language that Villafaña had included in the USAO’s 
earlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.122  Lefkowitz also again included the sentence 
122  
The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal 
criminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any 
criminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] . . . .”    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 105 of 348
SA-105
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page107 of 258

precluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings 
against the two assistants who were foreign nationals. 
At this point, Lefkowitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email:  “I am 
happy to talk.  My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my 
staff by allowing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.]  I’ll have 
her set something up.” 
Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz her own revised NPA, telling him it was her “attempt at 
combining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.”  She inserted solicitation 
of minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would 
plead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 30-month sentence, divided into 18 months 
in the county jail and 12 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.123  
Villafaña’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal 
process in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it 
to apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and 
deleting mention of the corporate entity employees.  Finally, Villafaña deleted mention of 
immigration proceedings, but advised in her transmittal email that “we have not and don’t plan to 
ask immigration” proceedings to be initiated.124   
Later that day, Villafaña alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C. 
early that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and 
co-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding 
promises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.”  There is no 
documentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement 
with Villafaña’s assessment.  Rather, within a few minutes, Villafaña re-sent her email, adding 
that defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which 
Lourie responded, “No way.  We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.”  Villafaña replied 
to Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other 
thoughts?”  When Lourie gave no further response, Villafaña informed defense counsel that Lourie 
had rejected the proposed immigration language.   
OPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential 
co-conspirators.”  Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left 
that provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some 
way.  In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential 
co-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were 
co-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme.  Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t 
going to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in 
123  
Villafaña noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a 
hospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an 
unlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”   
124  
Villafaña gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had 
been involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafaña believed the agent knew two of 
Epstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information.  Villafaña 
also said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 106 of 348
SA-106
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page108 of 258

federal court.  Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision 
was meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s 
conduct.  Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to 
prominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals, 
Sloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was 
directed toward any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked 
with Epstein.125  Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it.  He speculated 
that if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafaña and Lourie had 
“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.”  The West Palm Beach manager, who had 
only limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he 
had “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it. 
Villafaña told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had 
not developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators.  So, . . . we wouldn’t be 
prosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? . . .  I just didn’t think that there was anybody 
that it would cover.”  She conceded, however, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read 
as broadly as people have since read it.” 
K. 
The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender 
Registration Requirement  
On the afternoon of Friday, September 21, 2007, State Attorney Krischer informed 
Villafaña that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the 
terms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration.  According to Krischer, defense 
counsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal 
law enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.  
Krischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back 
from him.  Villafaña responded, “I think Alex is calling you now.”  Villafaña told OPR that, to her 
knowledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term.126 
Later that afternoon, Villafaña emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain 
time” Epstein would earn in state prison.  Villafaña explained in her email that she wanted to 
include a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain 
number of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison 
authorities to let him out early.”  Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood, 
Epstein would serve 15 months.  He also told Villafaña that a plea to a registrable offense would 
not prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention 
facility.127   
125  
Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have 
been prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Attorney’s] office in the country.”   
126  
Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein 
case or any other matter.  
127  
The State Attorney concluded his email:  “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in 
writing.  After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.”  Villafaña 
responded, “Sounds great.”  When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafaña said:  “Everybody 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 107 of 348
SA-107
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page109 of 258

At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkowitz by phone regarding the need for 
Epstein to plead to a registrable offense.  Throughout the weekend, with Villafaña’s Monday 
deadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement.  On 
Saturday, September 22, 2007, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie.  In the first, she provided 
details from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to 
child sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation.  She noted that she “spoke to 
[M]att [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her.  Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy 
email, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against 
registration [as a sexual offender] in this case.”  In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been 
a “miscommunication” during the September 12, 2007 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the 
solicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was 
NOT registrable.”  Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life 
sentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose 
“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.”  She listed numerous 
reasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of 
sexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked” 
without registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state 
registration requirements.  A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie 
“in case you want to speak to him directly.” 
In another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again 
because “you are a very fair person.  This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable.  [I]t is a 
result of a misunderstanding at a meeting.”  She stated that Epstein’s attorneys had “consistently 
emphasized their goal of 18 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable 
offense precluded” a camp designation.  Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly 
inconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that 
meeting.”  Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will 
eventually be proud of.  Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.” 
Lourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone 
conversation.  By email late that night, at 10:26 p.m., Lefkowitz asked Lourie to phone him. 
The next day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña—
to “follow up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that 
Epstein plead to a registrable offense.  Lefkowitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding” 
at the September 12, 2007 meeting: 
Before the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex 
prosecutor for 13 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not 
a registerable offense.  However, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable 
offense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken 
assumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to 
the Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge. 
has offered to buy me a cup of coffee.  I have had coffee with no one.”  Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which 
he referred related to the pressure he had been getting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 108 of 348
SA-108
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page110 of 258

Lefkowitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why 
registration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.”  In the event 
that Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkowitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate 
that the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist 
sentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors.  As Lefkowitz 
further argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist 
sentencing for the humiliation of registration.”  Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta, 
Lourie, and Villafaña discussed the matter in a conference call.   
Lefkowitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafaña that omitted identification of 
the charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.  Later that day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta: 
I got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal. 
Does that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit 
now to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his 18 month 
sentence and then be sentenced to 12 month[s] community control 
for that charge?  I thought that was exactly what you proposed 
[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some 
kind of federal charge).   
But that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 30 months total, 
and 18 in jail.   
How can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is 
not unduly endangered in jail? 
Acosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the 
AUSAs assigned to the case.”  Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafaña, and 
they had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.”  Acosta copied Villafaña, 
and she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”   
L. 
The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause 
Throughout that Sunday evening, Lefkowitz had numerous email exchanges with 
Villafaña, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.) 
and Villafaña.  Later that evening, Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a new version of the NPA that, for the 
first time, included a confidentiality term:   
It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be 
disseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order.  In the 
event the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to 
a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the 
Government agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure 
of this Agreement.  
After making additional revisions, Villafaña sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the 
“final” version, asking Acosta to let her know what he thought of it.  Among her revisions, she 
changed the confidentiality provision to the following:   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 109 of 348
SA-109
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page111 of 258

The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of 
any public record.  If the United States receives a Freedom of 
Information Act request or any compulsory process commanding 
the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein 
before making that disclosure.128 
VII. 
SEPTEMBER 24, 2007:  ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS 
SIGNED 
The contemporaneous emails show that Villafaña continued to update Acosta as the parties 
negotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA.  Shortly after midnight 
on Monday, September 24, 2007, Acosta sent Villafaña “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had 
sent to him.  Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the 
State Attorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein 
enter his guilty plea by a certain date.  Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with 
requiring the State Attorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a 
State court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing.  Accordingly, 
Acosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing 
recommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty 
plea and be sentenced by the specified dates.  Acosta also instructed Villafaña to restore a reference 
to Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.”  Lourie, 
who had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with 
Lefkowitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafaña.  Villafaña sent 
a new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkowitz later that morning.   
On the afternoon of September 24, 2007, Villafaña circulated the new “final” version of 
the NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkowitz to send her the 
signed agreement.  After Lefkowitz electronically transmitted to Villafaña a copy of the NPA 
signed by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel:  “They have scanned 
and emailed the signed agreement.  It is done.”   
In his transmittal email, Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to “[p]lease do whatever you can to 
keep this from becoming public.”  Villafaña responded: 
I have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West 
Palm Beach manager].  I don’t anticipate it going any further than 
that.  When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy 
to you.  The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept 
confidential since it also contains identifying information about the 
girls. 
When we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for 
the girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the 
128  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged 
co-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before 
disclosing the NPA.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 110 of 348
SA-110
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page112 of 258

agreement.  I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when 
a resolution was achieved. . . .  [The West Palm Beach manager] is 
calling, but [he] knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the money 
issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and 
the amount of time that has been agreed to.  [He] also is telling Chief 
Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone. 
OPR questioned Villafaña about this email.  She explained that she generally kept 
confidential the terms of the resolution of any case.  She understood that “the way that the [Epstein] 
case was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what 
happened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to know what the agreement was about.  
Villafaña emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter 
“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet 
with the victims herself to explain how the damages provision would work.  Villafaña also told 
him that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD 
Detective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.129  Villafaña forwarded to Acosta, Lourie, 
and the West Palm Beach manager Lefkowitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA 
from becoming public.  Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public 
except as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does 
he want?”  Villafaña replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI 
or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.”  Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafaña, 
and the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and how much,” adding, 
“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.” 
The final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafaña, 
contained the following pertinent provisions:   
Charges:  
Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment, 
plus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a 
registrable offense. 
Sentence: 
The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 30-month 
sentence divided as follows:  consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months 
in the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or 
sentencing and without community control or probation, followed by  
months of community control, consecutive.130 
Damages: 
As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’ 
status as victims.  The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals 
129  
The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.  
130  
Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation 
but does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.  See Fla. Stat. § 948.01 (2007).

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page113 of 258

it had identified as victims.131  The USAO, with the good faith approval of 
Epstein’s counsel, would select an attorney representative for the victims, 
whom Epstein would pay. 
Timing: 
Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced 
by October 26, 2007.  The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting 
to begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2008. 
Immunity: 
The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential 
co-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants. 
Other:   
Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Attorney’s 
Office to ensure compliance with this agreement.  
Epstein waived his right to appeal.  
Epstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to 
gain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any 
other inmate. 
The federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process 
held in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the 
agreement.  Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal 
process, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate 
until all the NPA terms had been satisfied.   
Breach: 
The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the 
agreement within 90 days of the expiration of the term of home 
confinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 60 days 
thereafter. 
Disclosure: 
The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of 
any public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act 
request or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it 
would provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure.132 
That evening, Lefkowitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he 
understood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly 
prejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”133  He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on 
131  
The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point.  The parties anticipated that 
the USAO would send Epstein’s attorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to 
enter his state guilty pleas. 
132  
The final NPA is attached as Exhibit 3 to this Report. 
133  
On October 3, 2007, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported 
that federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein.  According to the Post, Epstein would 
plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months,” followed 
by “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their

this matter.”  Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does 
not find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded:  “I enjoyed it as well.  Mr. Epstein was 
fortunate to have such excellent representation.”  
VIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS 
Almost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the 
difficult negotiation process began anew.  The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous 
issues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the 
parties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of 
the attorney representative for the victims.  As negotiations regarding the damages provision 
continued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.   
A. 
September – October 2007:  Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an 
Attorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum 
The first controversy centered on the appointment of an attorney representative for the 
victims.  Initially, Villafaña reached out to a private attorney who was one of several suggested to 
her for that role.  Villafaña notified Lefkowitz that she was recommending the attorney to serve as 
the victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the 
USAO could disclose to the attorney about the case.  Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she had never 
met the attorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by 
one of the district judges in Miami.134  Over the next few days, Villafaña exchanged messages with 
the attorney about the possibility of his serving as the attorney representative.  She also exchanged 
emails with Lefkowitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the attorney.   
By this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal 
Division.  Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to 
the office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the 
provision authorizing the USAO to select an attorney representative for the victims, which he 
believed might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Instead, he proposed that a special 
master make the selection.  Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafaña 
conveyed to Lefkowitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the attorney 
representative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.135  She provided Lefkowitz with 
probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the 
understanding that he will do prison time.”  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For 
Teen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007.  ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more 
substantial prison time.  Now, Epstein’s high-powered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out 
of registering as a sex offender . . . .”  Scott Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution 
Charges:  Jeffrey Epstein may serve about 18 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. 11, 2007. 
134  
The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafaña was dating.  The defense subsequently raised this as a 
misconduct issue, alleging that Villafaña was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’ 
representative position.    
135  
In a separate email to the proposed attorney representative, Villafaña commented, “[O]f course they tell me 
this now.” 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 113 of 348

a proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft letter to send to the 
special master explaining the procedure for selecting an attorney representative.   
Lefkowitz objected to this proposal in a letter to Villafaña, pointing out that the NPA did 
not provide for the appointment of a special master.  More importantly, Lefkowitz used the 
discussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the 
NPA or, at least, to its interpretation.  Focusing on the attorney representative, Lefkowitz argued 
that the attorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating settlements and that the attorney 
was precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated 
settlement with Epstein.  Lefkowitz proposed: 
[T]he selected attorney should evaluate the claims of each identified 
individual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then 
distribute the monies based on the strength of each case.  For those 
identified individuals who elect not to settle with Mr. Epstein, they 
may proceed on their own, but by doing so, they would not be suing 
under § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not 
continue to be represented by the selected attorney. 
Lefkowitz also objected to Villafaña’s draft letter to the special master, asserting that it was 
essential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the 
victims.  Going further, Lefkowitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims 
about the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision.  Lefkowitz 
admonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the 
case, including [the] appointment of the selected attorney and the settlement process.”   
Villafaña forwarded Lefkowitz’s letter to Sloman, complaining that the defense 
interpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I 
please just indict him [Epstein]?”  Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follow-up 
letter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the attorney representative’s role, and 
arguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’ 
civil lawsuits in the event a settlement could not be reached.  When Villafaña explained to Sloman 
her views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your 
proposal back to [Sanchez].  The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive 
between us.”  Villafaña agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we 
are getting triple-teamed.”136   
Villafaña sent Sanchez a letter regarding the roles of the special master and attorney 
representative.  The next day, October 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a six-page letter to Acosta,  as a 
“follow up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafaña’s 
view of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA.   Lefkowitz reiterated the 
defense position that the attorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating 
settlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation.  Lefkowitz claimed that a requirement 
136  
Villafaña also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a letter to 
Acosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.  Villafaña commented, 
“It appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”      
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 114 of 348
SA-114
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page116 of 258

that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound 
ethical problems,” in that the attorney representative would have an incentive to reject settlement 
offers in order to incur more fees.  In addition, Lefkowitz rejected Villafaña’s view that Epstein 
had waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to settle their 
claims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are 
victims under the enumerated statutes.”  Finally, Lefkowitz again argued that the USAO should 
not discuss the settlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for 
settlement under § 2255: 
Ms. Villafaña proposes that either she or federal agents will speak 
with the [victims] regarding the settlement process.  We do not think 
it is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor 
should the FBI be their personal investigators.  Neither federal 
agents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to 
inform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of 
the attorney representative and the settlement process.  Not only 
would that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but 
Mr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to 
the [victims] at this most critical stage.  We believe it is essential 
that we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication 
to the [victims].  We further believe that communications between 
your Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate 
Rule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  The 
powers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be 
utilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.137 
Lefkowitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:30 call 
today.”138   
Villafaña was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about 
crafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an attorney representative 
and to articulate the representative’s duties.  The next day, October 11, 2007, Sloman exchanged 
emails with Lefkowitz about the text of a proposed addendum. 
B. 
October 12, 2007:  Acosta and Defense Attorney Lefkowitz Meet for Breakfast 
On the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkowitz, Acosta exchanged 
emails with Lefkowitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the following day, on October 12, 2007, at 
a Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach.  Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was previously 
scheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October 11 and to speak at the Palm 
Beach County Bench Bar conference the following midday, and that he stayed overnight at the 
Marriott.   
137  
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury matters.  
138  
OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 115 of 348
SA-115
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page117 of 258

However, as with Villafaña’s publicly released emails to Lefkowitz, this meeting between 
Acosta and Lefkowitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation.  It 
was seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s attorneys 
while simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret 
agreements with the defense.  
Two letters written later in 2007 refer to the breakfast meeting.  In a December 2007 letter 
to Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkowitz at an 
October meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an attempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a 
litigious selection process.”139  In an October 23, 2007 letter from Lefkowitz to Acosta, less than 
two weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkowitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta  
assured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State 
Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or contact any of the 
identified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil 
claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; and that neither 
[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence 
Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the 
sentence does not violate state law.140 
However, two days after receiving this letter, Acosta revised a response letter drafted by 
Sloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkowitz’s claims that Acosta had promised 
not to intervene with the State Attorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or 
intervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.141  The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to 
the imposition of a gag order.  Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”142   
Acosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that 
the meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafaña had recommended “her 
boyfriend’s partner” to serve as attorney representative.143  Acosta said that “the way this was 
reported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate 
because the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.144  When asked about 
139  
In fact, Sloman and Lefkowitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast 
meeting with Lefkowitz.  It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgotten about them 
when writing the December 7, 2007 letter.   
140  
This letter is discussed further in the following section of this Report.   
141  
OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.   
142  
Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified” 
Lefkowitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting.   
143  
As noted previously, the attorney whom Villafaña recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom 
Villafaña was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafaña or the other AUSA. 
144  
For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2018 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the 
breakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s 
crimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut 
down an ongoing FBI probe . . . .”  Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump cabinet member gave 
a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.  The NPA, however, was finalized and signed

Lefkowitz’s description of their breakfast meeting discussion, Acosta told OPR that there were 
“several instances” in which Lefkowitz and other defense counsel mischaracterized something he 
or an AUSA said, in a way that was misleading.   
Emails show that, immediately after the breakfast, Acosta phoned Sloman, who then 
emailed to Lefkowitz a revision to the Addendum language they had been negotiating and who 
also later reported to Villafaña that Lefkowitz’s “suggested revision has been rejected.”  Other 
emails show that the parties continued to be at odds about the proposed language for the NPA 
addendum for several days after the breakfast meeting.   
C. 
Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the 
Parties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Attorney Representative 
and Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum  
A week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkowitz—citing a scheduling conflict— 
sent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state 
court from October 26, 2007, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 20, 2007.  In his email, 
Lefkowitz reported that the State Attorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted 
that Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the 
state.”145  Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkowitz and agreed 
to the postponement.   
With Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in 
negotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he 
quickly came up against the problem Villafaña and Lourie had faced: the defense attorneys 
continued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed.  Between October 
and 19, 2007, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman, 
Villafaña, and Lefkowitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the 
process for selection of the attorney representative and describing which of the representative’s 
activities Epstein would be required to reimburse.  Although it appeared that progress was being 
made towards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October 19, 2007, Lefkowitz 
emailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.  
Sloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished 
this week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues.  Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York 
had filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafaña was concerned that “this may be the real 
reason for the delay in the . . . plea.  She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out 
before the guilty plea to deter others.”   Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports 
indicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an attempt to discredit the victims.   
almost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred.  OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis 
at Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2. 
145  
Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkowitz attributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta 
had taken before the NPA was signed.   As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed 
Villafaña to omit language requiring the State Attorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not 
comfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline.  During his interview, Acosta told OPR that 
“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state attorney.”    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 117 of 348
SA-117
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page119 of 258

On October 22, 2007, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkowitz had raised, rejecting some 
defense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy 
your concern.”146  Noting that the addendum and a revised letter to the special master were 
attached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded.  Alex and I believe that this is 
as far as we can go.  Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB 
tomorrow . . . .” 
Nonetheless, the next day, Lefkowitz sent Acosta a three-page letter reiterating the Epstein 
team’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA.  Lefkowitz noted, however, that 
Epstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense 
letter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].”  Lefkowitz 
added: 
I also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during 
our October 12 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with 
regard to this matter, and assured me that your Office would not 
intervene with the State Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or 
contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or 
potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; 
and that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding 
the sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, 
so long as that sentence does not violate state law.  Indeed, so long 
as Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the 
Agreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him, 
including but not limited to gain time and work release. 
Sloman forwarded the letter to Villafaña, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”  
Villafaña replied: 
Welcome to my world.  I love the way that they want to interpret 
this agreement.  
. . . .  
It also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence 
far lower than the one we agreed to.  Has anyone talked to Barry 
[Krischer] about this?  Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in 
entering the guilty plea?  We also have to contact the victims to tell 
[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an 
attorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against 
Mr. Epstein.  If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida 
Bar Rules for the selected attorney to “cold call” the girls. 
146  
The defense raised issues concerning the attorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and 
inclusion of certain victims. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 118 of 348

. . . .  
Why don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him? 
Acosta also weighed in, sending both Villafaña and Sloman an email with a subject line 
that read “This has to stop,” in which he stated: 
Just read the letter. 
1. 
We specifically refused to include the provision saying that 
we would not communicate.  If I recall the conference call, we told 
him we could not agree to a gag order using those words. 
2.  
The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court 
settlement.  Seems that they can’t take no.  Let’s talk re how to 
proceed.  I’m not sure we will ever agree on a letter [to the special 
master about how to select an attorney representative] at this point. 
Notwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkowitz a new 
draft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s 
terms.147   
On October 25, 2007, Sloman sent a letter to the person whom the USAO had selected to 
serve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties.  A few days later, on October 29, 
2007, Epstein and his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.148  Villafaña’s 
name was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafaña’s request, Sloman signed the 
addendum for her on behalf of the USAO.   
Villafaña later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which 
apparently related to the defense attorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial 
selection of the private attorney to assist the victims.  Villafaña explained to Sloman: 
The funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or 
spoken to [the private attorney] before I asked him if he would be 
willing to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the 
appearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and 
agreed that the Special Master would be a safer route.  I just worry 
that the defense’s attacks on me could harm the victims. 
Sloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafaña’s role in 
proposing the private attorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad 
hominem attacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have 
accomplished.” 
147  
Acosta and Villafaña were copied on this email. 
148  
The Addendum is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.

D. 
Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea 
The addendum did not bring the case to conclusion.  Instead, the matter entered a new, 
protracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice.  Despite the 
fact that Epstein and his attorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing 
to senior Department managers with the goal of setting aside the NPA entirely.  Although 
ultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.  
On October 29, 2007, Villafaña emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted 
Sloman to address with Lefkowitz.  Among other things, Villafaña pointed out that the NPA 
required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply 
with the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing 
postponement from October 26 to November 20.  Responding to Lefkowitz’s attempts to limit the 
USAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafaña noted that the USAO 
needed to be able to communicate with the State Attorney’s Office and the victims’ attorney “to 
[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”   
That same day, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge 
assigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2008.  Belohlavek 
assured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that 
was agreed on by all for the sentencing.”149  Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month 
show that the USAO, the State Attorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate 
regarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2008 
date for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that 
Epstein had not agreed to any date.  Finally, after multiple communications referring to various 
potential dates, on December 7, 2007, Epstein attorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of 
Hearing, setting the case for January 4, 2008.150 
E. 
Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to 
Monetary Damages for the Victims  
With Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of 
the NPA, this time within the Department.  On November 16, 2007, Epstein attorney Kenneth Starr 
called the office of Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a 
message that he was calling regarding Epstein.151  At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late 
September 2007 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff, 
returned the call.  Fisher told OPR that she had no recollection of this call, and Lourie also could

could report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2008.

151  
In a meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 21, 2007, Lefkowitz informed them that Starr had placed 
a call to Fisher.

not recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about 
Epstein’s wish to have the Department review the case.152   
On November 28, 2007, Starr requested, by letter, a meeting with Fisher.  In his letter, Starr 
argued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under 
U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case.  On the same day, Lefkowitz 
emailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision 
and alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Attorney 
General “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component” 
of the NPA.  After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr letter, Sloman forwarded it to 
Villafaña, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and how the § 2255 provision 
evolved.  Villafaña responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried 
to breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.” 
In Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterbaan, asking for his 
thoughts on defense counsel’s arguments.  At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafaña sent 
the NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterbaan.  Oosterbaan responded to Lourie that he was 
“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly 
because of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “pretty advantageous for the defendant 
and not all that helpful to the victims.”  He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney General 
would not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”  
During her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s letter or discussing it with 
Oosterbaan, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal 
prosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate.  She told OPR, however, that she 
“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it 
was signed. 
As set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafaña planned to notify the 
victims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she 
provided a draft of the notification letter to Lefkowitz for comments.  On November 29, 2007, 
Lefkowitz sent Acosta a letter complaining about the draft notification to the victims.  Lefkowitz 
asked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant 
Attorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the following week.  Internal 
emails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterbaan about his availability for a meeting with Starr, 
but both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no 
evidence that it did. 
Acosta promptly responded to Lefkowitz by letter, directing him to raise his concerns about 
victim notification with Villafaña or Sloman.  Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to 
stop the NPA from being enforced: 
152  
In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply:  “He was very nice.  Kept me on the phone 
for [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.

[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two 
months[] ago, it has become clear that several attorneys on your 
legal team are dissatisfied with that result. 
. . . . 
[You], Professor Dershowitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr, 
former United States Attorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs. 
Black, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to 
review and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.  The 
defense team, however, after extensive negotiation, chose to adopt 
the Agreement.  Since then counsel have objected to several steps 
taken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the 
Agreement, in essence presenting collateral challenges to portions 
of the Agreement. 
It is not the intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to 
enter a plea against his wishes.  Your client has the right to proceed 
to trial.  If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes 
that it is unlawful or unfair, we stand ready to unwind the 
Agreement. 
In a separate, seven-page letter to Starr, with Villafaña’s and Sloman’s input, Acosta 
responded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 letter to Assistant Attorney General Fisher.  
Fisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the letter, 
but she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the 
Criminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”153   
In his seven-page letter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2007, Acosta wrote: 
The Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into between this Office 
and Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global 
resolution of his state and federal criminal liability.  Under this 
Agreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for 
enumerated sections of Title 18 in favor of prosecution by the State 
of Florida, provided . . . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal 
interests:  (1) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable” 
offense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a 
sufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not 
harm the interests of his victims. 
Acosta explained in the letter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims 
in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; 
no less.”  Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255 
153  
The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s letter raised issues that had not been previously 
raised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 122 of 348

provision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by 
Epstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA.  Acosta’s letter concluded: 
Although it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision 
being appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our 
prosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel 
with the option of appealing our decisions.  Indeed, although I am 
confident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I 
nonetheless directed them to consult with the subject matter experts 
in [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving 
their [charges].  I am thus surprised to read a letter addressed to 
Department Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been 
raised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in 
fact resolved, in your client’s favor. 
I am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this 
Agreement.  The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense 
counsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics 
used by the defense team.  It appears to them that as soon as 
resolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to 
challenge the resolution collaterally.  My response thus far has been 
that defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the 
client.  That said, there must be closure on this matter.  Some in our 
Office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to 
mount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even 
after Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the 
agreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind. 
. . . . 
I would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force 
the hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his 
wishes.  Your client has the right to proceed to trial.  Although time 
is of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue 
victim notification letters until this Friday . . . to provide you with 
time to review these options with your client. . . . We expect a 
written decision by [December 7, 2007] at 5 p.m., indicating 
whether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the 
Agreement. 
Acosta explained to OPR that he did not view his letter as “inviting” Departmental review, 
but he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns.  Moreover, the 
USAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have 
prompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach.  Acosta noted that defense counsel 
repeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to 
declare him in breach more difficult.  In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s letter, Starr and 
Lefkowitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Attorney General Fisher) that 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 123 of 348
SA-123
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page125 of 258

the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of 
unwinding the agreement.”   
On December 7, 2007—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2007 letter to Starr—
the defense transmitted to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum, 
signed by Epstein.154  
F. 
Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It 
and Accuse Villafaña of Improper Conduct 
1. 
December 7 and 11, 2007:  Starr and Lefkowitz Send to Acosta Letters 
and “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation 
and Villafaña 
On the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr 
and Lefkowitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent 
criminal defense attorney and former U.S. Attorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported 
improprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal 
judge and former U.S. Attorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery 
provision under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”   
Days later, on December 11, 2007, Starr sent a letter to Acosta transmitting two lengthy 
submissions authored by Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the 
“background and conduct of the investigation.”  These submissions repeated arguments previously 
raised by the defense but also asserted new issues.  In one submission, 20 pages long, Lefkowitz 
addressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized 
Villafaña for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented 
federal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State 
Attorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are 
significantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead 
guilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”155 
  Lefkowitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that 
was “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and 
interview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed 
information that “compromised the federal investigation.”  Finally, Lefkowitz criticized federal 
involvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.”  In a second, 
13-page submission, Lefkowitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the 
NPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of 
helping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial settlements.”     
154  
The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and 
Addendum to same dated October 30, 2007.” 
155  
Villafaña sent Lefkowitz a five-page letter responding to the accusations made against her personally.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 124 of 348
SA-124
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page126 of 258

Notwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkowitz added that Epstein 
“unconditionally re-asserts his intention to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the 
NPA. 
2. 
As a Result of the Starr and Lefkowitz Submissions, the New USAO 
Criminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta 
Agrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel 
After reviewing Starr’s and Lefkowitz’s letters, Sloman notified Villafaña that “in light of 
the recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded 
Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying 
the proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafaña to provide Senior with all the state 
and FBI investigative materials.   
In the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense attorneys to 
discuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkowitz’s December 11, 2007 submissions.156  The 
meeting took place in Miami on December 14, 2007.  The defense team included Starr, 
Dershowitz, Lefcourt, and Boston attorney Martin Weinberg.  The USAO side included Acosta, 
Sloman, Villafaña, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and 
Assistant Special Agent in Charge also present.  In addition to previously raised arguments, during 
this meeting, Epstein’s attorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein 
had agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.   
3. 
The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review 
of the USAO’s Actions  
Shortly after the December 14, 2007 meeting, Lefkowitz notified Acosta that if the issues 
raised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative 
but to seek review in Washington.”  Acosta notified Assistant Attorney General Fisher that the 
defense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and 
“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”  
Starr and Lefkowitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy letter, with numerous previously submitted 
defense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought 
a “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.”  The 
letter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under 
state law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was 
“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a 
claim” under the statute.   
156  
As Assistant Attorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr 
would speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrow issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.  Acosta 
had the Starr and Lefkowitz submissions of December 11 forwarded to Fisher.

4. 
Acosta Attempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning 
Monetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It 
Acosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255 
provision.  He sent to Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he 
proposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section.  Mandelker 
forwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and 
Acosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer.  On December 19, 2007, after Acosta and 
Sloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkowitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a letter 
proposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language 
of the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read: 
Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an 
offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she 
would have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense.  For purposes of implementing 
this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to 
name . . . as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.  Any 
judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority 
determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, 
shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these 
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.  
Acosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the 
defense delays.157 
Lefkowitz responded by letter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised 
“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when 
attempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”158  In a follow-up 
letter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry 
of his guilty plea, Lefkowitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct 
cause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made 
and will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as 
possible.” 
Acosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly 
frustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “11th hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the 
157  
As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter also addressed defense objections 
to notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.   
158  
After Starr and Lefkowitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkowitz sent a second letter 
to Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and 
becoming truly unmanageable.”  In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December 19, 2007 NPA modification 
letter.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 126 of 348

101 
scheduled January 4, 2008 plea hearing.  As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve 
an expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by  
January 4, 2008, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled.  On January 2, 2008, Sloman 
spoke with Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing 
had been postponed.  In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafaña, Sloman said that Epstein’s 
local defense attorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts 
“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that 
assessment.159  The next day, Villafaña sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article 
reporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal 
authorities would drop their investigation of him.  Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafaña an 
email memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkowitz in a phone call that day:  “‘I 
[Lefkowitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.  [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not 
registrable.  It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”160 
5. 
January 7, 2008:  Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes 
Additional Allegations of USAO Misconduct 
On January 7, 2008, Acosta and Sloman met with defense attorney Sanchez at her request.  
According to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the 
USAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national 
news reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC 
by agreeing to a watered-down resolution for Epstein.”  After Acosta excused himself to attend 
another meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,” 
she left.  Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkowitz, and Sanchez, 
who expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA, 
and pressed for the “watered-down resolution,” which they specified would mean allowing Epstein 
to plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register 
as a sexual offender.  A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwritten notes of the conversation 
reads:  “We’re back to where we started in September.”   
That evening, Villafaña expressed concern that the delay in resolving the matter was 
affecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his 
agreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein 
was pursuing Departmental review.  Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims, 
interviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact 
with “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to 
obtain Epstein’s computers. 
In the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts” 
review of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence 
Villafaña had compiled.  He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined 
159  
Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth 
facts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.   
160  
Although the meeting Lefkowitz had with Lourie, Villafaña, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state 
resolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkowitz’s reference was likely to the September 12, 2007 meeting.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 127 of 348

102 
that it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go 
forward with” the charges.  He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we 
did not have . . . a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not 
be favorable for us.”  Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he 
told Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.   
6. 
Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence 
Notwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkowitz 
that they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that 
the Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the 
defense.”  They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that 
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan would designate an attorney having “a national perspective” to conduct 
a fresh review in light of the defense submissions.  Oosterbaan assigned a CEOS Trial Attorney 
who Villafaña understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not 
“consummate” the NPA.  The CEOS Trial Attorney traveled to Florida to review the case 
materials, and to meet with Villafaña to discuss the case and interview some of the victims.  After 
one such meeting, Villafaña wrote to Acosta and Sloman: 
We just finished interviewing three of the girls.  I wish you could 
have been there to see how much this has affected them. 
One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview 
twice within a 20 minute span.  She regained her composure enough 
to continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares 
about Epstein coming after her and she started to break down again, 
so we stopped the interview. 
The second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the 18 
month deal she had read about in the paper.  She said that 18 months 
was nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get 
restitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein 
spend a significant time in jail. 
. . . . 
These girls deserve so much better than they have received so far, 
and I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.161 
The CEOS Trial Attorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.  
She told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges 
for a prosecution:  some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein; 
some had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged 
as accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been 
“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.  She did not regard 
161  
Villafaña added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrow.  Can I persuade you to attend?”  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 128 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page130 of 258

103 
these victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Attorney 
considered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.”  In addition, she told OPR that 
there were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these 
difficulties could be overcome.  Shortly after the CEOS Trial Attorney met with the victims, 
however, “things just stopped” when Oosterbaan instructed her to cease her involvement in the 
case and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.   
IX. 
FEBRUARY – JUNE 2008:  THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW 
Epstein’s defense attorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would 
encompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the 
various allegations of professional misconduct by USAO attorneys and other personnel.  The 
Department, however, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA 
or any specific provisions.162  Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense 
appealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the 
Deputy Attorney General.  The chart set forth on the following page shows the positions and 
relationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO 
or defense beginning in November 2007 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through 
June 2008. 
162  
On February 28, 2008, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division written 
notification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation matter” involving Epstein and others “that 
may result in charges of violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.”  USAM § 8-3.120 required a U.S. Attorney to notify the 
Civil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal 
civil rights statutes, . . . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses 
before a grand jury.”  The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.  
The written notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the 
statutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Attorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the 
case was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Attorney’s proposed staffing of the matter.   
Villafaña became aware of this requirement in late February 2008, and she prepared a written notification 
that was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta.  After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:  
The Office anticipates charges of violations of Title 18, United States Code, 
Sections 371, 2422, 2423, and 1591.  The investigation of the case by the City of 
Palm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the 
titillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child 
prostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a matter of “national interest” 
as defined by the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. 
In the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the matter,” he 
anticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should 
be [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.”  OPR did not locate a response from the 
Civil Rights Division to the notification.

A.
February – May 15, 2008:  Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division 
On February 21, 2008, soon after the CEOS Trial Attorney met with victims, Oosterbaan 
spoke with Lefkowitz about CEOS’s role.  In a subsequent email to Villafaña, Sloman, and Senior, 
Oosterbaan explained:
I told [Lefkowitz] that all I want to do is help the process move 
forward, and if they think we best help the process by taking a fresh 
and objective look at the case and their arguments [then] that is what 
I want to do.  I told him that if that’s what they want – if that is what 
will help the process to move forward – then I don’t think it’s 
advisable for CEOS to partner with the USAO on the case.  He wants 
to think about that (and probably talk to his co-counsel about

whether it is better to have us partnered in the case or just serve a 
review function) and he said he’d get back to me later today. 
Oosterbaan told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to 
limit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with 
that,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.  
Oosterbaan explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new 
problems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with 
it, tell us now.”   
By February 25, 2008, Lefkowitz told Oosterbaan, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS 
role should be “review only.”  Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice, 
and Oosterbaan continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Attorney General 
Mandelker, informed of the defense team contacts.  Sloman emailed Lefkowitz that CEOS was 
“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the matter.  Sloman advised Lefkowitz that “in 
the event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein, 
this Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s 
position, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].”  Sloman forwarded this email 
to Villafaña, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has 
put us through?  And after we have discovered 6 new girls . . . .” 
The defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the 
Department’s involvement.  On February 29, 2008, Lefkowitz requested a defense meeting with 
Oosterbaan on March 12, 2008.163  Starr spoke to Assistant Attorney General Fisher and “made it 
clear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the 
prosecution.”  On March 6, 2008, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterbaan that Starr and Lefkowitz 
had called him to express “concern” about Oosterbaan’s participation in the case, and indicated 
that “they may ask for more senior involvement.”  Acosta “informed them that they certainly had 
the right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever 
process would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”  
The next day, Lefkowitz followed up with Acosta in an email: 
We appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice 
determines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this matter.  
As you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with 
Drew Oosterbaan, and engage in a discussion with him about all of 
the facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues 
associated with this case. . . .  However, due to our misgivings 
(engendered because Drew has told us that he sees himself as a 
prosecutor and has already made clear he would be ready and willing 
to prosecute this case himself[)] we may well find it necessary to 
163  
The defense team meeting with CEOS was originally to be set for late January, but never got scheduled for 
that time.  On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkowitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays” 
in the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS 
time to engage in a thorough review.”

appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.  Ken [Starr] 
and I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to 
our seeking appellate review within DOJ. 
Starr, Lefkowitz, and Martin Weinberg attended the March 12, 2008 meeting, as well as 
the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.  
Oosterbaan, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department.  The 
current CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing 
most of the presentation.  Oosterbaan told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the 
defense team was saying “some outrageous things.”  Both Oosterbaan and his Deputy Chief were 
disturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for 
child exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the 
CEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not 
effective. 
After the meeting, Starr and Lefkowitz made multiple written submissions to the Criminal 
Division.  One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious 
concern,” including the following: 
“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any 
communication with state authorities”;164  
the issuance of legal process and document requests for items that 
“had no connection to the conduct at issue”; 
the nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the 
Assistant United States Attorneys involved in this case” to serve as 
the victims’ attorney representative; 
the “insistence” on a victim notification letter inviting the victims to 
make sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and 
the purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a 
law firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits 
against Epstein.165 
164  
This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafaña’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO 
communications with the state authorities.  In November 2007, Sloman noted to Lefkowitz, “Your recent 
correspondence attempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Attorney’s Office . . . raises 
concern.”  In a March 2008 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafaña noted that she did not know 
whether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact 
with the State Attorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Attorney] in over 6 months.”  Villafaña 
later reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating 
with him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”   
165  
In approximately 2001, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a 
Miami attorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.  During 2007-2008, the attorney

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page134 of 258

107 
In another letter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed 
information about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafaña of “encouraging civil 
litigation” against Epstein.  Finally, in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Fisher on  
May 14, 2008, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the 
defense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkowitz, and Whitley.    
Meanwhile, Oosterbaan’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision letter to be sent from Oosterbaan 
to Lefkowitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, as well as 
the Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of 
Enforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy).  Oosterbaan told OPR that, notwithstanding 
the defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited 
to determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.    
Oosterbaan’s letter, sent to Lefkowitz on May 15, 2008, notified the defense team that 
CEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal 
criminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.”  The letter specified 
that CEOS’s review addressed the “narrow question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a 
federal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues 
relating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA 
or the prosecutorial misconduct allegations.  The letter stated that based on its examination of the 
material relevant to its limited review of the matter, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution 
in this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his 
discretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”    
On May 19, 2008, Lefkowitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically 
asked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”  Lefkowitz made several points in support 
of the request for a meeting:  (1) CEOS’s letter acknowledged that federal prosecution of Epstein 
would involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;166 (2) CEOS’s conclusion that 
federal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the 
case;167 (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical 
new evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that 
represented Epstein victims.  The Epstein defense team alleged in the letter that Sloman’s past association with the 
attorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.  
166  
Oosterbaan’s letter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution 
even though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.”  This statement referred to a defense argument 
based on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult 
prostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.”  Oosterbaan stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly 
focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults 
through force, fraud, or coercion.”  He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look 
precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”    
167  
Oosterbaan began his letter, however, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrow question as 
to whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Attorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of 
Mr. Epstein.”

federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”168  Lefkowitz alluded to the possibility of 
seeking further review of the matter by the Deputy Attorney General or Attorney General, should 
the defense be unable to “resolve this matter directly with” Acosta.   
Acosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkowitz to communicate 
with the “trial team.”  That same day, Sloman sent Lefkowitz a letter asking that all further 
communication about the case be made to Villafaña or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating 
that Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls.  Sloman noted that the USAO 
had “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but 
“these objections have finally been exhausted.”  Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate 
the NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on  
June 2, 2008.   
B. 
May – June 23, 2008:  Review by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
Also on May 19, 2008, Starr and Whitley co-authored a letter to Deputy Attorney General 
Mark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state matter.”169  In 
the letter, they acknowledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the 
Epstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of 
the Justice Department.”  They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and 
that “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond 
any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.”  They followed up 
with a second letter on May 27, 2008, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the 
enforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented 
extension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton” 
required Departmental review.  On this latter point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public 
arena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that 
there was “little doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case 
if Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’”  This was the first defense submission mentioning 
Epstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement 
in the investigation was due to politics. 
In the May 27, 2008 letter to the Deputy Attorney General, Starr and Whitley used the 
existing June 2, 2008 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need 
for review of the case “all the more exigent.”  John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Attorney 
General who was handling the matter, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on  
May 28, 2008, Sloman notified Lefkowitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending 
completion of the review by the Deputy Attorney General’s office.170  Meanwhile, the Criminal 
168  
Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220, defendants are permitted to depose victims, and Epstein’s 
counsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims, 
including victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation. 
169  
In addition to having served as U.S. Attorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting 
Associate Attorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.  
170  
On May 28, 2008, Attorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO 
with Acosta and other senior managers.  OPR found no indication that the Epstein matter was discussed.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 134 of 348

109 
Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous 
amount of material” regarding the Epstein matter.  On June 3, 2008, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy 
letter from Sloman to the Deputy Attorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations 
with Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional 
misconduct.  Among the documents submitted with the letter were the prosecution memorandum, 
one of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s 
December 19, 2007 letter to Sanchez. 
As the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, State Attorney 
Krischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local 
defense attorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve 
a 90-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information.  Upon learning of this, Villafaña 
wrote to her immediate supervisor:  “Please tell me that you are joking.  Maybe we should throw 
him [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.”  Villafaña and her immediate 
supervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to 
insist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the 
agreement and proceed accordingly.”171  
Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving 
Starr’s letter.  Following the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s letter was handled by John Roth, 
an experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the 
USAO.  Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein.  Roth explained to OPR 
that he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s 
counsel, and instead limited his review to written materials submitted by Epstein’s attorneys and 
by Sloman to the Deputy Attorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and 
the USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that 
CEOS furnished to him.  Roth discussed the matter with two senior staff colleagues, as well as 
with the Deputy Attorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.   
Roth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and 
because he believed the NPA was a “dead letter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or 
ratify it post hoc.  On the other hand, Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR he understood that 
the NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis 
for the agreement.  Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, however, Deputy 
Attorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether 
the NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment.  He told OPR, “[W]e 
heard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief.  We didn’t give him a meeting 
and we didn’t give him [any] relief.”  Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his 
office who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.”  In particular, he 
told OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was 
“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated 
“just seemed unserious.”   
171  
Villafaña urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.” 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 135 of 348

110 
On Monday, June 23, 2008, Roth sent a brief letter to Starr and Lefkowitz informing them 
that the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein matter 
and did not believe intervention by the Deputy Attorney General was warranted in view of the 
“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Attorneys.  He added, “Even if we 
were to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution 
of this case is appropriate.”   
Immediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s letter, Villafaña notified defense counsel that 
Epstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the NPA 
by entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence.  On 
June 26, 2008, Roth alerted the Office of the Attorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to 
contact the Attorney General to request additional review and urged the Attorney General not to 
take defense counsel’s calls.  Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try 
to take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.   
Meanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknowledging they had reached “the 
end of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe 
is the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize 
that we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. . . .  I would like to have . . . some 
closure with you on this matter so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will 
over the matter.” 
X. 
JUNE 2008 – JUNE 2009:  EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS 
CUSTODIAL SENTENCE 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, Villafaña renewed her requests to Epstein’s local attorneys 
Goldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Attorney’s 
Office, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA.  After receiving 
and reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafaña sent another letter to 
Goldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with 
the requirements of the NPA.  Specifically, as written, the plea agreement called for a sentence of 
months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” followed consecutively by “18 months 
Community Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of 
community control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.”  Villafaña objected to the 
community control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to 
“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement 
twenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.”  In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafaña recounted 
that she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in 
custody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.”  Villafaña 
added that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade 
. . . . Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Attorney] months ago that 
Epstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”172  
Villafaña told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”   
172  
The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum 
custody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.  See 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 136 of 348
SA-136
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page138 of 258

111 
The next day, Villafaña asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the 
word “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so.  Villafaña, however, did not 
ask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County 
Detention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade.  The final signed plea agreement form 
further clarified the sentence, providing that after serving 12 months in the Palm Beach County 
Detention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention 
Facility . . . to be served consecutive to the 12 month sentence,” followed by “12 months 
Community Control.”  The word “imprisoned” was hand written after “6 months” but then crossed 
out and replaced by “jail sentence.”173   
A. 
June 30, 2008:  Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court 
Epstein, with his attorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on  
June 30, 2008, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of 
solicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of 
procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.174  At the plea hearing, which Villafaña and the 
FBI case agent attended as spectators, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts 
of the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal 
information: 
[B]etween August 1, 2004 and October 31, 2005, the defendant in 
Palm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit 
[prostitution] on three or more occasions.  And . . . between  
August 1, 2004 and October 9, 2005, the defendant did procure a 
minor under the age of 18 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach 
County also.175 
The court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in 
a colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims: 
The Court:   
Are there more than one victim? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
There’s several. 
. . . . 
http://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.  The “Stockade” was a “lower security ‘camp-style’ facility” 
co-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  Both were administered by the Sheriff’s Office. 
173  
Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 30, 2008, and filed in court.  Villafaña complained to Goldberger when 
she learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”  
174  
The Information is attached as Exhibit 5. 
175  
State v. Epstein, case nos. 06-CF-9454 and 08-CF-9381, Transcript of Plea Conference at 41-42 (Fifteenth 
Judicial Circuit, June 30, 2008) (Plea Hearing Transcript).  Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language 
of the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 137 of 348

112 
The Court:   
Are all the victims in both these cases in 
agreement with the terms of the plea? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
I have spoken to several myself and I have 
spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the 
other victim, and I believe, yes. 
The Court:   
And with regard to the victims under age 
eighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian 
in agreement with the plea? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
That victim is not under age 18 any more and 
that’s why we spoke with her counsel. 
The Court:   
And she is in agreement with the plea? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
Yes.176 
When the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations 
by any civil attorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present, 
spoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution 
agreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.   
After the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to 
the plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.   
In the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed 
positive reactions to the outcome, and Villafaña received several congratulatory messages.  
Oosterbaan wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last!  Your work on this matter was truly 
exceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.”  One senior 
colleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad 
guy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.”  Another wrote, “If it had not 
been for you, he would have gotten away with it.”   The CEOS Trial Attorney who had worked 
briefly with Villafaña told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s 
life.”  One victim’s attorney stated, “[G]reat job of not letting this guy off.”  But Villafaña was not 
satisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I 
don’t feel like celebrating 18 months.  He should be spending 18 years in jail.”   
Acosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer 
congratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black,

and Belohlovek did not recall during her OPR interview, but it is possible that she was referring only to the victims of 
the charged crimes rather than to all of the victims identified in either the state or federal investigations.  Belohlavek 
told OPR that because of the nature of the charges (that is, involving prostitution), she did not know whether 
“technically under the law” the girls were “victims” whom she was required to notify of the plea hearing.

Dershowitz, Lefkowitz and Starr.”177  In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he 
received communications from Dershowitz, Starr, and Lefkowitz, who “all sought to make peace” 
with him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”   
On July 7, 2008, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in 
federal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined 
the petition soon thereafter.  The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in 
Chapter Three of this Report.   
B. 
Epstein Is Placed on Work Release 
A few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafaña reported to Sloman that Epstein was 
incarcerated at the low-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county 
prisoners were usually housed.  She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein 
was eligible for work release.  Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be 
incarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed 
explicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue.  Epstein’s 
acceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as 
another special benefit given to Epstein.  Because the decision to allow Epstein into the work 
release program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether 
any state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated.  OPR did examine the USAO’s 
consideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to 
ensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.     
The first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed, 
when Lefkowitz asserted, in his October 23, 2007 letter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s 
sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence 
available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”   
In November 2007, Sloman had an exchange of letters with Lefkowitz about the USAO’s 
understanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,” 
pointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.”  Sloman noted 
that Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allow individuals registered as sexual 
offenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release 
program.  Sloman concluded that the USAO “is putting you on notice that it intends to make certain 
that Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no better and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same 
offense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the 
reasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”178   
However, also in November, State Attorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact, 
eligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place 
177  
Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The Daily 
Beast.  The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknowledged that 
it could have occurred.   
178  
Sloman provided a draft of this letter to Acosta for his approval before the letter was sent to Lefkowitz.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 139 of 348

114 
until after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is 
in the agreement.”179  On November 16, 2007, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if 
the State Attorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.  
Belohlavek was noncommittal, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s 
plea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she 
would have to discuss the issue with the State Attorney.180  Krischer later told OPR that work 
release was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.”  The state’s plea agreement 
with Epstein did not address the issue of work release.   
The day after Epstein entered his June 30, 2008 plea, Villafaña and her immediate 
supervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release.  According to 
Villafaña, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on 
work release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a 
jail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense attorney Jack 
Goldberger to Villafaña just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told 
[Villafaña] that [Epstein] would not get work release.”  Villafaña alerted the Sheriff’s Office 
official that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every 
day” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist 
until November 2007.181  Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida 
Science Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger.  Villafaña and her 
supervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.   
Acosta told OPR that he was aware Villafaña was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get 
work release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts.  Acosta explained that the USAO 
expected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shown by “our subsequent 
communications with the [S]tate [A]ttorney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not 
what our office envisioned.”   
In August 2008, Villafaña spoke with defense attorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s 
compliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release.  Villafaña later reported to Acosta 
and Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . 18 months IN JAIL is a 
material term of the agreement.” 
The USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application.  On October 10, 
2008, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach 
Sheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permitting him to leave the Stockade 
179  
According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex 
offender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”  
180  
In the November 16, 2007 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafaña also indicated that she was 
“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work 
release.  In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafaña that they had also spoken with a “jail 
supervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the 
judge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.   
181  
During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had 
been in existence for 15 years, and he worked there “every day.”   Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.

for up to 12 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office 
in West Palm Beach.182  In mid-November 2008, Villafaña learned that Epstein was on work 
release.  She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development 
in an email, and asked, “Can I indict him now?”   
On November 24, 2008, Villafaña sent defense attorney Black a letter, notifying him that 
the USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program 
constituted a material breach of the NPA.  Villafaña reminded Black that she had “more than a 
dozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for 18 months, 
and that her June 27, 2008 letter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-
four hours a day.”  Villafaña noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into 
the plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.”  Villafaña 
told counsel: 
The [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based 
upon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e., 
confinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the 
federal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.  Accordingly, the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated 
the [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day 
for the eighteen-month term of imprisonment.  The United States 
will exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless 
Mr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this 
agreement. 
According to Villafaña, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release 
coordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to 
believe the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened 
with legal action if he did not allow Epstein to participate in work release.    
On November 26, 2008, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from 
all matters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the 
Epstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.183  As a 
result, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to 
Epstein.   
Also on November 26, 2008, Black responded to Villafaña’s letter, acknowledging that 
Epstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying 
that Epstein was in breach of the NPA.184  Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release; 
the NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate; 
182  
Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm 
Beach Daily News, Dec. 13, 2008.   
183  
The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2008.   
184  
Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafaña “is very concerned about anything Epstein does” 
and that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 141 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page143 of 258

116 
Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s 
Office had discretion to grant work release to any inmate.  Black also claimed that Acosta 
“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release 
Program” and pointed out that the December 6, 2007 draft victim notification letter sent to 
Lefkowitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is 
allowed to participate in a work release program.”   
On December 3, 2008, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafaña sent 
Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work 
release program: 
It appears that, since Day 1, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have 
been scheming to get Epstein out on work release.  For example, the 
indictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would 
have made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged 
correctly.  (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with letting 
us believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when 
Epstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was 
not registrable.)  Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that 
Epstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the 
Stockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at 
the jail. . . .   
As part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff’s 
deputies to provide him with “protection.”  It appears that he is 
paying between $3000 and $4100 per week for this service, despite 
the work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and 
the Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions 
with inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the 
Sheriff . . . .” 
Villafaña added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge 
on the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement.  Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafaña also 
pointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed 
about the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon 
Epstein’s release.”   
On December 11, 2008, Villafaña wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach 
County Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release 
and to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several 
inaccuracies and omitted relevant information.  Villafaña pointed out that Epstein’s application 
identified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number 
listed in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law 
firm of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger.  Villafaña also noted that the individual identified in 
the work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submitted 
publicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked 
only one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 142 of 348
SA-142
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page144 of 258

117 
the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for 12 hours per 
day.  Finally, Villafaña pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor”—who as the 
Foundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had 
promised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the 
“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor 
Epstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis.  The Sheriff’s Office neither acknowledged nor 
responded to Villafaña’s letter. 
In March 2009, Sloman met in Miami with Dershowitz for, as Dershowitz characterized it 
in a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the 
Epstein case.  After that encounter, Dershowitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for 
Sloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with how the Palm Beach sheriff administers” 
Epstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.”  Sloman responded: 
Regarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Attorney’s Office will not 
interfere with how the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the 
sentence imposed by the Court.  That being said, this does not mean 
that the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the 
terms and conditions of his sentence.  Furthermore, it does not mean 
that, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or 
in-home detention, we would not object.  To be clear, if contacted 
we will object.  Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of 
Mr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent 
to PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or 
home detention. 
A week later, Dershowitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for 
Sloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position 
on how he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but 
adding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”    
Epstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a 12-month period 
following his release from prison.  On July 22, 2009, almost 13 months after he began serving his 
sentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.185  At this 
time, he registered as a sexual offender.  
XI. 
POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS 
In the summer of 2009, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear 
Stearns, and that he had been released early from his 18-month imprisonment term because of that 
185  
In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision 
program.  Florida Statute § 948.001(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the 
community.”

118 
cooperation.186  When Villafaña spoke with attorneys in the Eastern District of New York, 
however, an AUSA there told Villafaña that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not 
cooperated with the Bear Stearns case.187  During her OPR interview, Villafaña told OPR that to 
her knowledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”   
Villafaña and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the 
NPA.  In August 2009, Villafaña alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of 
his home detention—he had been spotted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police, 
he claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.  Villafaña 
passed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.188  By letter dated 
September 1, 2009, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision 
of the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein 
maintained his “primary residence.”  In response, Villafaña notified Black that the USAO opposed 
such a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA.  Three months later, Sloman met with 
Dershowitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of 
Epstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s 
supervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.   
After serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on 
July 21, 2010. 
186  
See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2009. 
187  
The New York AUSA had emailed Villafaña, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] . . . .  We 
saw the below article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never 
heard of until this morning.  We’ve since learned that he is pretty unsavory.”  Villafaña reported to Sloman and other 
supervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of] 
New York.  They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a low sentence because he was 
cooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution.  They had never heard of him.”  In a second email, she 
confirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”   
188  
Black later wrote a letter to Villafaña claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the 
distance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the matter was “fully investigated,” 
Epstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.

CHAPTER TWO 
PART TWO:  APPLICABLE STANDARDS 
I. 
OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK  
OPR finds professional misconduct when an attorney intentionally violates or acts in 
reckless disregard of a known, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional 
conduct, or Department regulation or policy.  In determining whether an attorney has engaged in 
professional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual 
findings. 
An attorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the attorney (1) engages 
in conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously 
prohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knowing its natural or probable consequence, and that 
consequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits.  An attorney acts 
in reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (1) the attorney knows or should know, 
based on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an 
obligation or standard; (2) the attorney knows or should know, based on his or her experience and 
the unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the attorney’s conduct involves a 
substantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard; 
and (3) the attorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under 
all the circumstances.  Thus, an attorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents 
a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable attorney would 
observe in the same situation.  
If OPR determines that an attorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR 
determines whether the attorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct, 
made a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances.  An attorney exercises poor 
judgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that 
is in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an attorney 
exercising good judgment to take.  Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an 
attorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not 
have violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard.  In addition, an 
attorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not 
sufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding.  A mistake, on 
the other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an attorney’s exercise of reasonable 
care under the circumstances.  
An attorney who makes a good faith attempt to ascertain the obligations and standards 
imposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional 
misconduct.  Evidence that an attorney made a good faith attempt to ascertain and comply with 
the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the attorney 
reviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and 
standards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the attorney 
representing a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took

120 
affirmative steps the attorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or 
standard. 
II. 
APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 
A. 
The United States Attorneys’ Manual  
Among its many provisions, the United States Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes 
general statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and 
desirable practices to be followed, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial 
responsibilities.189  The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial 
authority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and 
to promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and 
objectively on the merits of each case.”  USAM § 9-27.001.  
Because the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of 
government attorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing 
guidance rather than mandating results.  Id.; see also USAM § 9-27.120, comment (“It is expected 
that each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law 
enforcement responsibilities . . . . However, it is not intended that reference to these principles will 
require a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.110, comment 
(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when, 
whom, how, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).  
However, USAM § 9-27.130 provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal 
prosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline.  In particular, USAM 
§ 9-27.130 states that each U.S. Attorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that 
prosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with 
the principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles 
set forth in the USAM are followed by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary 
sanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate. 
U.S. Attorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal matters” and may 
modify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of 
fair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.  USAM §§ 9-2.001, 
9.27-140.  The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource 
Manual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal 
prosecutions. 
1. 
USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a 
Federal Prosecution  
Federal prosecutors do not open a case on every matter referred to them.  USAM § 9-2.020 
explicitly authorizes a U.S. Attorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to 
189  
In 2018, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.  In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR 
relies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.  Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, 
citations in this Report are to the 1997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2007.

him/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.”  Whenever a U.S. Attorney closes a 
case without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it.  USAM 
§ 9-27.220 sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence 
or decline federal prosecution.  A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution 
if he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a 
conviction of a federal offense, unless (1) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the 
person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate 
alternative to prosecution.  A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to 
determine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor 
“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.230, 9-27.240, or 9-27.250, as appropriate. 
USAM § 9-27.230 sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal 
prosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by 
initiating prosecution against a person: 
1. 
Federal law enforcement priorities;190 
2. 
The nature and seriousness of the offense;191 
3. 
The deterrent effect of prosecution; 
4. 
The person’s culpability in connection with the offense; 
5. 
The person’s history with respect to criminal activity; 
6. 
The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation 
or prosecution of others; and 
7. 
The probable sentence or other consequences if the person 
is convicted. 
The USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case 
in deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred.  USAM § 9-27.240 directs 
that in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor 
should weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s 
interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and 
the probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other 
jurisdiction.  A comment to this provision explains: 
190  
A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal 
prosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities. 
191  
A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must 
also include consideration of the impact on the victim.  The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue, 
“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution 
merely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.” 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 147 of 348

122 
Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of 
particularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local 
jurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the 
offense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the 
investigation was conducted primarily by state or local 
investigators, or some other circumstance.  Whatever the reason, 
when it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less 
substantial than the interest of state or local authorities, 
consideration should be given to referring the case to those 
authorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal 
prosecution. 
Another comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the 
Federal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, attitudes, relationships or other 
circumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a 
thorough and successful prosecution.” 
USAM § 9-27.260 identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether 
to initiate or decline a federal prosecution.  Specifically, the decision may not be based on 
consideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities, 
or beliefs; the prosecutor’s “own personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible 
effect of the decision on the prosecutor’s own professional or personal circumstances.  When 
opting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision 
are communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files.  USAM § 9-27.270. 
2. 
USAM § 9-2.031:  The Petite Policy 
Although the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and 
federal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the 
Department has a long-standing policy, known as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions 
charged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar 
conduct.192  The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set 
forth in USAM § 9-2.031, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which 
contains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring 
a federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or 
federal proceeding.  The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal 
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, 
or a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”   
In circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new 
federal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.  The prerequisites are as follows: 
(1)  
The matter must involve a substantial federal interest.  The determination whether 
a substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis.  Matters 
192  
See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (1977); Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529 (1960).  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 148 of 348
SA-148
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page150 of 258

123 
that come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established 
by the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other matters. 
(2) 
The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably 
unvindicated.”  In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has 
vindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain 
circumstances.  As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the 
choice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as 
incompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence.  The presumption may 
be overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior 
sentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a 
substantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as 
imprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal 
prosecution.” 
(3) 
The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal
offense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and
sustain a conviction. 
However, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a 
federal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed 
prosecution. 
The Petite policy cautions that whenever a matter involves overlapping federal and state 
jurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most 
appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests 
involved.”  If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular 
prosecution, the prosecutor should submit the matter to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General 
for resolution.  Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General must be obtained 
before bringing a prosecution governed by this policy. 
3. 
USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements 
Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a 
plea agreement.  USAM §§ 9-27.330; 9-27.400.  Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned 
by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).193  Regardless of whether the plea agreement is 
offered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the 
totality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.”  USAM § 9-27.400, comment.194  The 
importance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM 
§ 9-27.430, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that 
represents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the 
193  
As previously noted, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a 
specific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.   
194  
See also USAM § 9-27.300 (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the attorney for the government 
should charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is 
likely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 149 of 348

124 
defendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an 
appropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or 
prosecution of others.  USAM § 9-27.420 specifies:  
In determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea 
agreement, the attorney for the government should weigh all 
relevant considerations, including: 
1. 
The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the 
investigation or prosecution of others; 
2. 
The defendant’s history with respect to criminal 
activity; 
3. 
The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses 
charged; 
4. 
The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her 
willingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct; 
5. 
The desirability of prompt and certain disposition of 
the case; 
6. 
The likelihood of obtaining a conviction at trial; 
7. 
The probable effect on witnesses; 
8. 
The probable sentence or other consequences if the 
defendant is convicted; 
9. 
The public interest in having the case tried rather 
than disposed of by a guilty plea; 
10. 
The expense of trial and appeal; 
11. 
The need to avoid delay in the disposition of other 
pending cases; and 
12. 
The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution. 
4. 
USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements 
USAM § 9-27.600 authorizes government attorneys to enter into a non-prosecution 
agreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation.  The provision explains that a non-prosecution 
agreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely 
cooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired 
cooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.”  A comment to this provision explains that 
such “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 150 of 348
SA-150
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page152 of 258

125 
cooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.  
The comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permitting an 
offender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in 
the first instance.”  USAM §§ 9-27.620 and 9-27.630 set forth considerations a prosecutor should 
take into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement.  Generally, the U.S. Attorney 
has authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement.  USAM § 9-27.600 comment.  However, 
USAM § 9-27.640 directs that a government attorney should not enter into a non-prosecution 
agreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the 
appropriate Assistant Attorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who 
“is likely to become of major public interest.”   
These USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in 
circumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation. 
5. 
USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity 
Nothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure 
of third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant.  Instead, the provision that addresses 
immunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has 
asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  See USAM §§ 9-23.100 et seq.   
6. 
USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest 
Department employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related 
laws, rules, regulations, and policies.  See, generally, USAM § 1-4.000 et seq.  Specifically, a 
government attorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and 
substantially in any particular matter in which he has a financial interest or in which such an 
interest can be imputed to him.  See 18 U.S.C. § 208 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.401-402.  In addition, 
a Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any 
matter in which his impartiality could be questioned.  If a conflict of interest exists, in order for 
the employee to participate in the matter, the head of the employee’s component, with the 
concurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in 
the employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the 
integrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in 
writing.  See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.501-502. 
B. 
Other Department Policies 
1. 
Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges 
The Attorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the 
Department.  Over the span of several decades, each successive Attorney General has articulated 
those priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors.  As applicable here, on 
September 22, 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding 
“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and 
Sentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).  The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous 
Departmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 151 of 348
SA-151
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page153 of 258

126 
prosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the 
Sentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing 
practices.”195 
The Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge 
and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of 
the case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or designated 
supervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances.  The Ashcroft Memo cautioned 
that a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either 
the law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.  The Ashcroft 
Memo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all 
charges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence 
under the Sentencing Guidelines.   
The policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor 
to decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the written 
or otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or “designated 
supervisory attorney.”  As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be 
appropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Attorney’s Office is 
“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and 
proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.  
The Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea 
agreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo. 
On January 28, 2005, Deputy Attorney General James Comey issued a memorandum 
entitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.”  That memorandum 
reiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily 
provable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial 
sentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any 
statutorily required consecutive sentence. 
Importantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line 
prosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is 
placed upon the U.S. Attorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.  In 
addition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allowing a prosecutor 
195  
The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 
(2005), which struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose 
a sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range.  Those Guidelines were the product of 
the United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.  The 
Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003, Pub. 
L. 108–21, 117 Stat. 650, was directed at preventing child abuse.  It included a variety of provisions designed to 
improve the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.  Among other things, the PROTECT Act 
provided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple 
occasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified 
numbers of images.

127 
flexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or 
evidence supports the charge. 
2. 
Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens 
On April 28, 1995, the Attorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors 
entitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly 
become involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States.  In pertinent 
part, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious 
deportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with 
alien defendants.  These tools include (1) stipulated administrative deportation orders in 
connection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under 
U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252a(d).  The 
memorandum further directs: 
All deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless 
extraordinary circumstances exist.  Accordingly, absent such 
circumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of 
deportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most 
appropriate in a particular case.  Exceptions to this policy must have 
the written approval of the United States Attorney.  
See also USAM § 9-73.520.  A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a 
crime.196 
Stipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense 
to which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in 
U.S.C. § 1251 as an offense that causes an alien to be deported.  Under 8 U.S.C. 
§ 1251(a)(2)(A)(i), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years 
after the date of entry (or 10 years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident 
status), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is 
deportable.   
C. 
Case Law 
1. 
Prosecutorial Discretion 
On many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s 
discretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute.  In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357 
(1978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek 
more serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense 
originally charged.  The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and 
196  
According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have 
been convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border 
Patrol.”  See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics, 
Criminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2020, available at https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-
statistics/criminal-alien-statistics.

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page155 of 258

128 
the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges.  Hayes was thereafter convicted and 
sentenced under the new indictment.  The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his 
conviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a 
legitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process.  Hayes filed for review of his 
conviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted 
impermissible vindictive prosecution. 
The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling.  The Court opined that “acceptance 
of the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty 
plea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining 
process.”  Id. at 363.  A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been 
committed, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a 
grand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.”  Id. at 364 (emphasis added).  The Court explained that 
selectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable 
standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.  Id. 
These principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), a case 
involving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves 
as having failed to register with the Selective Service system.  The petitioner in Wayte claimed 
that the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were 
being punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.  The Supreme Court rejected this 
argument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and 
that the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an 
unjustifiable standard.  Id. at 607-08.  Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to 
have a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.   
In Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state 
prosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation 
of the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others 
had unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him.  The Court held that “in initiating a 
prosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the 
judicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit 
for damages.  Id. at 430-31.  In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (1st Cir. 1992), the court applied 
Imbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute.  The court noted that “given the 
availability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that 
symmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.”  Id. at 41 (emphasis in 
original).   
Finally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), the 
Supreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not 
reviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 500-706.  
2. 
Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency towards a Third Party 
Case law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party 
arises in two contexts.  First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 154 of 348
SA-154
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page156 of 258

129 
when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations.  Numerous courts have 
made clear, however, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a 
promise of leniency towards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third 
party if a plea is not entered.  See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 909 F.2d 738, 741-42 (2d Cir. 
1990) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by 
the government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he 
pled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1244, 1248 (11th Cir. 1985) (in order to satisfy “heavy 
burden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging 
voluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against 
the defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe 
the defendant’s wife had committed a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v. 
State, 839 So. 2d 906, 909 (Fla. App. 2003) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a 
third party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge 
the third party.”). 
The second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’ 
promises of leniency to third parties.  For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App. 
1997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in 
open court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew, 
who had all been charged as a result of the same incident.  When the state reneged and attempted 
to prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state 
appealed.  The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law 
principles, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were 
therefore entitled to enforce it.   
Apart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a 
prosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of 
prosecutorial discretion.    
D. 
State Bar Rules 
During the period relevant to this Report, the five subject attorneys were members of the 
bar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in 
which they held membership.197  In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of 
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law 
provisions of each applicable bar.  Local Rule 11.1(f) incorporates rules governing the admission, 
practice, peer review, and discipline of attorneys (Attorney Admission Rules).198  Attorney 
Admission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Attorney or AUSA employed full-time by the 
government may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United 
States in the attorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.  Any attorney so appearing 
197  
The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.   
198  
These rules have been in effect since December 1994.

is subject to all rules of the court.199  Attorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that 
attorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct 
(FRPC).  Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of 
professional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.   
1. 
FRPC 4-1.1 – Competence 
FRPC 4-1.1 requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.200  
Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation 
reasonably necessary for the representation.  A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors 
relevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular matter include “the relative 
complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s 
training and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give 
the matter, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer 
of established competence in the field.”  The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the 
required proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular matters, 
competence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.  
The comment to Rule 4-1.1 explains that “[t]he required attention and preparation are determined 
in part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more 
extensive treatment than matters of lesser complexity and consequence.” 
2. 
FRPC 4-1.3 – Diligence 
FRPC 4-1.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in 
representing a client.  A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf 
of a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take 
whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.”  A 
lawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every 
advantage that might be realized for a client.” 
3. 
FRPC 4-4.1 – Candor in Dealing with Others 
FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact 
or law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.  A comment to this rule 
explains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or 
omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular 
statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.” 
199  
See also 28 U.S.C. § 530B(a), providing that government attorneys are subject to state laws and state and 
local federal court rules governing attorneys in each state where the government attorney engages in his duties. 
200  
The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United 
States.  See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Attorney); 28 C.F.R. § 0.5(b) (the Attorney General represents 
the United States in legal matters).

131 
4. 
FRPC 4-8.4 – Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice 
FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit, or misrepresentation.   
FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice 
of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.   
In Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2000), the court noted that FRPC 
4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to 
“conduct in connection with the practice of law.”  In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 41 So. 3d 166, 172 
(Fla. 2010), for example, an attorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s 
matter resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due 
to the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.201 
201  
OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor.  Nothing in the text of that rule, 
however, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report.  A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has 
adopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.  
These “standards,” however, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors.  Indeed, the 
ABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional 
discipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for 
civil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.”  OPR does not consider 
the ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.

CHAPTER TWO 
PART THREE:  ANALYSIS 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
Following the Miami Herald report in November 2018, media scrutiny of and public 
attention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated.  At the heart 
of the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s 18-month sentence, which resulted in a 13-
month term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal 
conduct.  Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from 
Epstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making 
process leading to the signed NPA.  As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s 
motivations for entering into the NPA.  Publicly released communications between prosecutors 
and defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the 
NPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because 
they were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships 
with his attorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.    
Through its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the following core questions:  (1) who 
was responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its 
specific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules 
or regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by 
improper factors, such as corruption or favoritism.  To the extent that available records and witness 
interviews shed light on these questions, OPR shows in detail the process that led to the NPA, from 
the initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.  
After a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive 
interviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions 
concerning the NPA’s origins and development.  Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth 
its conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.   
II. 
ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT  
Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knowledge of its terms.  He 
revised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate.  Acosta told OPR that 
he either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the 
case against Epstein.  OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled 
him about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta 
did not make such a claim to OPR.  As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged 
resolution, two years . . . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my 
authority. . . .  [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I . . . accept that.  I’m not . . . pushing away 
responsibility for it.”  
In making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.  
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña were involved in the matter to varying degrees, at 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 159 of 348
SA-159
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page161 of 258

134 
different points in time, and regarding different decisions.  Menchel, for example, participated in 
formulating the USAO’s initial written offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions 
or decisions made after August 3, 2007.  Sloman was absent during part of the most intense 
negotiations in September 2007 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he 
returned.  Villafaña and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions 
during the September 12, 2007 meeting with the defense and State Attorney’s Office, or at least 
indicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval.  In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s, 
Menchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafaña’s involvement, they acted with the knowledge and approval of 
Acosta.   
Under OPR’s analytical framework, an attorney who makes a good faith attempt to 
ascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given 
situation does not commit professional misconduct.  Evidence that an attorney made a good faith 
attempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not 
limited to, the fact that the attorney consulted with a supervisor.202  In this regard, OPR’s 
framework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars, 
which specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in 
accordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of 
professional duty.  See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b).  Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not 
find a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed below, OPR concludes that 
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña did not commit professional misconduct with respect to 
any aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval. 
III. 
OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND 
UNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR 
STANDARD, 
OR 
DEPARTMENT 
REGULATION 
OR 
POLICY, 
IN 
NEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA  
A central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of 
the subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and 
unambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy.  OPR does not find professional 
misconduct unless a subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous 
standard.  OPR considered three specific areas:  (1) standards implicated by the decision to decline 
a federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal 
investigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the 
NPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties.  As discussed 
below, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his 
decisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Attorney possessed broad 
discretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates, 
and that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous 
standard.  As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject attorneys violated a clear and 
202  
The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate 
attorney has not acted in “good faith.”  OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did 
not claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.

135 
unambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or 
entering into the NPA, including its addendum.  
A. 
U.S. Attorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as 
They Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute 
Epstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct 
The U.S. Attorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.203    
As a general matter, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to 
help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully 
executed.’”  United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, 
§ 3).  Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary 
classification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law 
or statute and are not subject to judicial review.  See United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 762 
(1997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, 
so long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).   
Department policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case 
helped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular 
prosecutorial decision in any given case.”  USAM §§ 9-27.001, 9-27.120 (comment).  Rather than 
mandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a 
prosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution 
in another jurisdiction.”  USAM § 9-27.220.  Importantly, U.S. Attorneys had “plenary authority 
with regard to federal criminal matters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth 
in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their 
individual judicial districts.  USAM §§ 9-2.001, 9-27.140.  As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United 
States Attorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Attorney General with the broadest 
discretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline 
prosecution.  USAM § 9-2.001.    
In addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline 
federal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance 
in the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other 
jurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute 
effectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other 
jurisdiction.  USAM § 9-27.240.204  A comment to this provision stated that the factors are 
“illustrative only, and the attorney for the government should also consider any others that appear 
relevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”   
203  
See, e.g., Wayte, 470 U.S. at 607; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 380 n.11 (1982); 
Bordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 409. 
204  
The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.240 to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is 
distinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to 
bring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal 
proceeding.  See USAM § 9-2.031.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 161 of 348
SA-161
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page163 of 258

136 
As the U.S. Attorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was 
motivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the 
USAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate.  As discussed in detail below, 
OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or 
influenced by improper considerations.  Because no clear and unambiguous standard required 
Acosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the 
state, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal 
prosecution of Epstein.     
B. 
No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a 
Non-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein  
OPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to 
resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.   
The prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through 
a non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution 
agreement.  United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  These agreements 
“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal 
conviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a 
defendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability 
altogether.”  Id. at 738.  As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case 
through a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally 
with the Executive” branch.  Id. at 741. 
OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-
prosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case.  The USAM specifically 
authorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution 
agreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put 
the person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as 
testimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.”  USAM § 9-27.600 (comment).205  The 
“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of 
another person.  In certain circumstances, government attorneys were required to obtain approval 
from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement 
in exchange for cooperation.   
Epstein, however, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the 
USAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in 
circumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of 
another.  Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases 
involving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other 
situations.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous 
obligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution 
205  
USAM § 9-27.650 required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully 
memorialized in writing.  Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied 
by fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.

137 
agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain 
Departmental approval before doing so.  
C.  
The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and 
Unambiguous Standards  
Although Acosta, as U.S. Attorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a 
non-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a 
clear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.  
Specifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal 
investigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution 
and solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an 18-month sentence of 
incarceration.  Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-
prosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating 
to plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements.  OPR also 
examined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,” 
to determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.  
Finally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the 
Department’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required 
further action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals. 
After considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to 
resolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous 
standards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea 
and through the terms that he chose.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit 
professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other 
subjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.206 
1. 
Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required 
Epstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an 18-Month Term of 
Incarceration 
Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a 
plea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.  
USAM §§ 9-27.330, 9-27.400; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).  
206  
OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafaña failed to comply with 
professional ethics standards requiring that attorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a 
client.  Attorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires 
the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.  See, e.g., FRPC 
4-1.1, 4-1.3.  The requirement of diligence obligates an attorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but 
does not require the attorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.”  See FRPC 4-1.3 
(comment).  Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those 
decisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence.  The subjects 
exhibited sufficient knowledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA 
negotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.  An attorney may 
attain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the 
requirements of the standard.

138 
Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most 
serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal 
conduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes 
likely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect 
the investigation or prosecution of others.  See USAM §§ 9-27.430, 9-27-300, 9-27.400 
(comment).  The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal 
prosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial 
sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines.  However, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important 
exception:  a U.S. Attorney or a “designated supervisory attorney” may authorize a plea that does 
not comport with this policy.207  Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not 
“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the 
evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.   
By its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily 
provable charge” requirement.  The draft indictment prepared by Villafaña proposed charging 
Epstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors, 
and Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of 168 to 210 
months’ imprisonment.  The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-
negotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original 
state indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration. 
Instead, Epstein was permitted to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state 
indictment and only one additional state offense, and an 18-month sentence. 
As discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie 
perceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafaña outlined in the prosecution 
memorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which 
a federal prosecution would be premised.  On the other hand, Villafaña felt strongly that federal 
charges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice 
opined that the charges were appropriate.  OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question 
whether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, however, because Acosta had 
207  
In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional 
Circumstances,” as follows:  
Prosecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in 
other exceptional circumstances with the written or otherwise documented 
approval of an Assistant Attorney General, United States Attorney, or designated 
supervisory attorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing 
Reform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the 
federal criminal justice system.  For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss 
charges in a particular case might be given because the United States Attorney’s 
Office is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be 
exceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total 
number of cases disposed of by the office.  However, such case-by-case 
exceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be 
jeopardized. 
Ashcroft Memo at § I.B.6.  See also USAM §§ 9-2.001 and 27.140 (U.S. Attorneys’ authority to depart from the 
USAM).

139 
authority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense” 
requirement. 
Although Acosta could not recall specifically how or by whom the decision was made to 
allow Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or how 
or by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to 18 
months, Acosta was aware of these changes.  He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it 
was signed.  Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding 
any arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.  
Furthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Attorney from deferring to a 
state prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state 
charges.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that allowed Epstein 
to resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an 18-month state sentence did 
not violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional 
misconduct. 
2. 
The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential 
Co-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous 
Department Policy 
Several witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute 
unidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the 
witnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy.  Although “use immunity” protects a 
witness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of 
the witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from 
prosecution altogether and is relatively rare.  
OPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Attorney from declining to prosecute third parties 
or providing transactional immunity.  One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied 
only to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth 
Amendment privilege.  See USAM § 9-23.100 et seq.  Statutory provisions relating to immunity 
also address the same context.  See 18 U.S.C. § 6002; 21 U.S.C. § 884.  Moreover, apart from 
voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not 
to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  See, 
e.g., Marquez, 909 F.2d at 741-43; Kemp, 760 F.2d at 1248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 909; Frazier, 
697 So. 2d 945.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s 
agreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that 
negotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted 
professional misconduct. 
Notwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of 
Acosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its 
potential consequences, including to whom it would apply.

3. 
The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation 
of Criminal Aliens  
  During the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the 
USAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to 
institute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants.  However, OPR considered 
whether the April 28, 1995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute 
Epstein’s two female assistants who were known to be foreign nationals—as Villafaña urged in 
her prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded 
the USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution.  OPR found 
nothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.    
The Attorney General’s April 28, 1995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal 
Aliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of 
removing criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.520, provided that 
“[a]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”  
However, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that 
would have triggered their removal.  But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed 
an obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did 
either provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad 
discretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions. 
The policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration 
officials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration 
authorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants.  OPR learned during its 
investigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.  
Moreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants, 
who, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further 
notification was required.   
IV. 
THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE 
INFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS 
FAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO 
EPSTEIN   
            OPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or 
Villafaña—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth, 
status, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or 
whether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation.  OPR 
considered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s 
July 31, 2007 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2007.  OPR also 
thoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were 
motivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense 
counsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally known attorneys; 
emails between the subjects—particularly Villafaña—and defense counsel that appeared friendly, 
casual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 166 of 348
SA-166
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page168 of 258

141 
to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators.  These factors are analyzed in the following 
discussions throughout this Section of the Report.   
As a threshold matter, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the 
Epstein matter uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or 
personal consideration.  In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary 
record, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject attorneys.  The evidence shows three 
sets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA.  The first—of 
main concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.  
The second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and 
Lourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what 
some viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.208  
The third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s 
conduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.    
Although the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did 
not find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit 
Epstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth, 
status, or associations.  That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous 
wealth.  He was able to hire nationally known attorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive 
experience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations.  He had the resources 
to finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple written 
submissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings 
involving several of his attorneys and USAO personnel.  He assembled a defense team well versed 
in the USAO and the Department, with the knowledge to maneuver through the Department’s 
various levels and offices, a process unknown to many criminal defense attorneys and infrequently 
used even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy.  Access to highly skilled and 
prominent attorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or 
certain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes 
or violent offenses.  Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the 
outcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive attorneys, OPR concludes that the 
subjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper 
factors.      
A. 
OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity, 
or Illegal Political or Personal Consideration   
Some public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein matter implied that the 
subjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no 
specific information substantiating such implications was identified.  Throughout its investigation, 
208  
Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about 
the Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his attorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report 
that OPR should not attribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about how to resolve the case.  However, 
Sloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated 
in meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted 
in determining how to resolve the Epstein investigation.

142 
OPR was attentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or 
other illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.209  Witnesses, 
including law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information 
indicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same 
witnesses of the Epstein matter’s outcome—stated that they did not.  Specifically, the FBI case 
agent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had 
perceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit.  The co-case 
agent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they 
were unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the matter because of illegal factors such 
as a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately 
have been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.  
B. 
Contemporaneous Written Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did 
Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly 
Influenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations  
Although Epstein’s name is now nationally recognized, in 2006 and 2007, he was not a 
familiar national figure or even particularly well known in Florida.  All five subjects told OPR that 
when they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein.  Similarly, the FBI case 
agent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of 
Epstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.  
However, news reports about Epstein’s July 2006 arrest on the state indictment, which were 
contemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm 
Beach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey, 
and Alan Dershowitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”210  Villafaña, 
Lourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus 
understood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.211   The FBI case 
agent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his 
connections.”   
1. 
The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing 
That the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors 
OPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the 
terms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential 
connections.  Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence 
that did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison, 
but the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.  Defense counsel mentioned 
former President Clinton in one pre-NPA letter, but that reference was made in the context of a 
209  
OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.  If OPR had found 
indication of criminal activity, it would have referred the matter to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.

211  
Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial 
prosecution memorandum.

143 
narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s 
association to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the 
defense argument that the matter should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.212  The defense 
submission to the Deputy Attorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection 
to former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and 
signed, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his 
association with the former President.213   
2. 
The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable 
Strategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences 
In addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject 
attorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making 
decisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in 
negotiating the NPA.  Villafaña, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal 
investigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she 
understood had been used with the State Attorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to 
counter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to 
Epstein’s tactics.  Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving 
wealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case.  Acosta told OPR, “[W]e 
tried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . how wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to 
do this because he is so wealthy.”  Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not 
believe “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.”  Lourie 
told OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case, 
but it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that 
the USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.  
Other witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents, 
who told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently 
because of his wealth.  The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO 
expressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth 
and influence.   
 OPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative 
evidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such 
motivations.  Of more significance, and as discussed more fully below, was the fact that 
contemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge 
resolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.214  OPR also 
212  
In the pre-NPA letter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable 
works, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel 
also noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a committed 
philanthropist.”    
213  
In the letter to the Deputy Attorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been 
“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”   
214  
OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors 
that influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.  Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and 
Villafaña all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 169 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page171 of 258

144 
considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring 
Epstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to 
victims—had been made by July 31, 2007, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the 
defense.  This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated 
any plans to do so.  It also was well before Acosta’s October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with 
defense counsel Lefkowitz, which received strong public and media criticism.  OPR also 
considered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course 
of negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end 
federal involvement altogether and return the matter to the state authorities to handle as they saw 
fit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender, 
despite a strong push by the defense that it do so.    
3. 
Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records 
Identified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal 
Theories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims 
Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content 
of discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for 
Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafaña 
identified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that 
either did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely 
influenced Acosta’s decision-making.  These considerations included assessment of the 
evidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims.  For the most part, however, 
these factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge 
disposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation 
through a guilty plea in state court.  That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns 
about intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement 
authorities.   
In a declaration submitted to the district court in 2017 in connection with the CVRA 
litigation, Villafaña explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation 
through the NPA: 
Prior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in 
negotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and 
weaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management, 
and informed them that most of the victims had expressed 
significant concerns about having their identities disclosed. . . .  It is 
my understanding from these and other discussions that these 
factors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and 
the various competing interests of the many different victims 
(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with 
the Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration 
for Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims, 
Acosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their 
colleagues, was motivated by improper influences.

145 
and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were 
among the factors [that led to the NPA].215 
During her OPR interview, Villafaña similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to 
go forward with a trial: 
[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them how they 
wanted the case to be resolved.  And most of them wanted the case 
to be resolved via a plea.  Some of them wanted him not to be 
prosecuted at all.  Most of them did not want to have to come to 
court and testify.  They were very worried about their privacy 
rights.216   
In his written response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall 
the issues Villafaña set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the 
USAO in 2007.  Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about 
the charges and a potential trial: 
[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there 
was a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on 
appeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal 
215   
Doe v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafaña in Support of 
Government’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for 
Summary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2017). 
216  
These concerns are also reflected in a 2017 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation, 
in which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2006 to 2008, no victims expressed a strong opinion that 
Epstein be prosecuted.”  She further described the concerns of some of the victims:   
Throughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims . . . .  
A majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their 
identities to the public.  A number of the victims raised concerns about having to 
testify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.  
Additionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible 
exposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.  Overall, many of the 
victims were troubled about the existence of the investigation.  They displayed 
feelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to 
investigators.  Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused 
even to speak to us.  Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and getting to 
the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation. 
In addition, during the CVRA litigation, an attorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect 
the anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners.  See Response to 
Court Order of July 6, 2015 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2015).  It is noteworthy that in 
2020, when OPR attempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to written questions 
regarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about 
remaining anonymous.  One victim described to OPR how she became distraught when, during the USAO’s 
investigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a 
victim of Epstein.  At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her 
parents to know about the case.

146 
record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of 
the names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed 
and the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their 
families. 
Although his emails showed that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein, 
Lourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the 
matter had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal 
prosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the 
cooperation and desires of the victims.”  
Similarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled 
understanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced 
additional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.  
Menchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein, 
Epstein would have elected to go to trial.  In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh 
the risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained 
through a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual 
offender, and made restitution to his victims.   
Sloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the 
government’s legal theories.  He told OPR:   
[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going 
to be reliable.  You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to 
be severely impeached.  People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who 
thought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I 
was 18 years old.   
You had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light 
being shown on them because their parents didn’t even know -- had 
very vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns. 
Acosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’ 
general credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which 
factored into the resolution.  He acknowledged that his understanding of the facts was not 
“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony, 
but he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make 
recommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case.  Acosta recalled discussing the facts 
with Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding 
of the facts as Villafaña.  Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably 
believed, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose 
significant evidentiary challenges.   
Other witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges, 
including the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims 
had expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 172 of 348
SA-172
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page174 of 258

147 
d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.”217  The co-case agent told OPR that one 
of the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he 
generally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the 
victims’ identities.  In addition, the CEOS Trial Attorney who briefly worked with Villafaña on 
the case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she 
formed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward.  The CEOS 
Trial Attorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an 
extensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about 
potentially being labeled as prostitutes.  The CEOS Trial Attorney also told OPR that “there were 
obvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.218 
The contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal 
and factual issues or other concerns about the case.  For example, in an early email to Menchel, 
Lourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafaña’s proposed charges were whether the USAO 
could prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some 
minor victims had told Epstein they were 18.  He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there 
is some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum] as this is 
uncharted territory to some degree.”  In his July 5, 2007 email to Villafaña, Menchel cited Acosta’s 
and Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal 
issues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.”  Defense counsel raised 
myriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous letters to the USAO.  Defense submissions 
attacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have 
undermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of 
victim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and 
purportedly lied to Epstein about their ages. 
Acosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial 
issues,” his own focus had been on “the legal side of things.”  Notably, during his prior tenure as 
the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had 
been involved in efforts to address sex trafficking.  He told OPR that one of the “background 
issues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his 
view of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of 
prostitution.  Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable 
federal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a matter 
of state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in 
2007.219 
217  
In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2007, when he located a 
victim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “know Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved 
away to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”  
218  
In April 2007, a victim who was represented by an attorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded 
interview with the FBI, with her attorney and his investigator present.  This victim denied being involved in, or being 
a victim of, criminal activity.  Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”   
219  
In his March 20, 2011 letter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast, 
Acosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.”    Most 
of the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved

The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues 
presented by a federal prosecution of Epstein.  Villafaña, in particular, believed she could have 
prevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly 
recommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she 
continued to have confidence in the case.220  Oosterbaan and others also believed that the 
government would succeed at trial.  Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group.  Some of 
them were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein 
prosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear how many expressed a willingness to testify at a 
trial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein.  In the end, Acosta assumed 
responsibility for deciding how to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and 
benefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition.  His determination that a pre-charge 
disposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.   
Although evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about 
winning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge 
disposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as 
opposed to a traditional federal plea agreement.  OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records 
a memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a 
state-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.   
According to Acosta, “In 2006, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States 
Attorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage 
teens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.”  Acosta told OPR that he 
developed “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not 
stepping on something that is a purely local matter, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for 
the sake of the larger human trafficking issue.”  Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding 
that the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Attorney’s 
Office had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender 
registration.  Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest 
injustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.  
Acosta acknowledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have 
viewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a 
“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[, 
‘]encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[’]”  In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case 
lay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial, 
and a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration 
that would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.” 
Acosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both 
told OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had 
the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.  Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have 
played a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.   
220  
Sloman told OPR that Villafaña “always believed in the case.”    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 174 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page176 of 258

149 
been concerned about policy and federalism issues.221  Sloman told OPR that although he did not 
remember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite 
policy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping 
our bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Attorney’s Office that 
was resolved by the State Attorney’s Office at some level.”  During his OPR interview, Menchel 
remembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried 
about “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although 
Menchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.   
C. 
Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the 
Subjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences 
OPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a 
suggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 31, 2007 terms was driven by corruption, a 
desire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.   
First, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was 
to benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him.  The NPA 
required Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism 
for the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the matter had been abandoned 
and sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate.  Epstein’s 
attorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation 
and that his conduct was exclusively a matter of state concern.  If the USAO had declined to 
intervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would 
have meted out the sole punishment for his behavior.  Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely 
would have received a sentence of probation.  Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on 
the wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no 
restitution for the victims.”  Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, however, the USAO devised 
a resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address 
the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the 
state’s original charge, standing alone, would have done.  Acosta’s affirmative decision to 
intervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather 
than exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that 
he was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.222  Similarly, despite defense counsel’s 
repeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to 
221  
Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was 
not.”  Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”   
222  
Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain” 
by showing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.”  Villafaña 
recounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense attorney who argued in one meeting that— 
we were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish.  We then pointed out that 
a number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish.  Then he 
said, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat.  And again, we 
pointed out that a number of us were Democrats.  So then it went to, we were 
prosecuting him because he was wealthy. . . .  That one didn’t work so well.

150 
reconsider the provision.  Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely 
if his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s attorneys.     
Second, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA.  Immediately after signing the 
agreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the 
investigation inappropriate.  In addition to repeatedly attacking the NPA in his submissions to the 
Department, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of 
misconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel.  Epstein’s dissatisfaction 
with the NPA, and his personal attacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the 
agreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s 
benefit.   
D. 
OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense 
Counsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors 
Established That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided 
Improper Benefits to Epstein  
In evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media 
accounts to show that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly 
suggested that the subjects acted from improper influences.  OPR examined these factors but did 
not find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other 
improper motivation.    
1. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any 
Improper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships 
with His Attorneys 
Epstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple attorneys who had preexisting personal 
connections to some of the government attorneys involved in his case, in the State Attorney’s 
Office, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department.  Based on the attorneys Epstein selected 
to represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring attorneys 
with relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him.  One of the first attorneys who 
contacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida.  Villafaña and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was 
close friends with one of Lewis’s law partners.  Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former 
AUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized.  Later, when Epstein 
was seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay 
Lefkowitz, prominent attorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from 
his previous employment with that firm.   
Villafaña told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s 
attorneys.”  Critically, however, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in 
the following subsection, neither Villafaña nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed 
identified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an 
improper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or 
for any other improper reason).  Villafaña explained how, in her view, the “legal prowess” of 
Epstein’s attorneys had an impact on the case:  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 176 of 348
SA-176
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page178 of 258

151 
[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to 
describe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.  
It was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.  But because 
they were able to convince members of our office that it was 
somehow extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became 
who was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues.  And 
because of that, the legal prowess, if you will, of the attorneys [ ] 
[became] something to consider. 
. . . . 
I think that the ability of Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr and Jay 
Lefkowitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t know what I was 
talking [about] also, all came into play.  So I think there were a 
number of factors and it all came together. 
Although Villafaña was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she 
conceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy.  Certainly, throughout 
the case, Epstein’s attorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing 
nuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes, 
and the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to 
carefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.   
There is little question that Epstein’s extensive team of attorneys was able to obtain 
negotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core 
requirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein 
certain other concessions during the negotiations.  Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled, 
experienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with 
attorneys who knew how to obtain Department review of a USAO matter, thereby delaying 
undesired outcomes for as long as possible.223  Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, however, OPR 
did not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’ 
relationships with the attorneys he had selected to represent him. 
2. 
The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel 
Did Not Influence Their Actions 
Acosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did 
not affect his handling of the case.  Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former 
colleagues often became adversaries.  In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were 
useful because they afforded a defense attorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a 
prosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense attorney to “tailor” 
arguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO.  Menchel told 
OPR, however, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he 
“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting 
223  
As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many 
million dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”     
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 177 of 348
SA-177
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page179 of 258

152 
friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s attorneys.  In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and 
his USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s attempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as 
“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”  
Sloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis 
and Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other 
colleagues and any of Epstein’s attorneys, but that in any event his attitude regarding cases 
involving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches 
with them.”  In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the 
equation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be 
best for the case.   
Lourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s attorneys “didn’t influence 
anything.”  Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s 
Professional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the 
investigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law 
partner.  OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility 
Officer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding 
relationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.   
Acosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on 
the term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages 
for the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s attorneys and before Epstein 
added Starr and Lefkowitz, the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys, to his team.  Acosta pointed out that 
the USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after 
Kirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.   
Acosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and 
Lefkowitz.  On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkowitz or Starr, he directed 
them to address their communications to Villafaña, Sloman, and other subordinates.  After his 
October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, Acosta immediately communicated with 
Sloman about their conversation.  In late 2008, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and 
was considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest 
and instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein matter.  On Acosta’s 
behalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department 
approval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible 
employment” with Kirkland & Ellis.  These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was 
cognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.224   
224  
In addition, in May 2008, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s 
Professional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein matter because he was 
considering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2009, and Dershowitz—a Harvard Law School 
professor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic 
or law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as 
a visiting professor.”  The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.

153 
In its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email written by Villafaña in 
2018, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year 
sentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel 
as a favor to defense attorney Sanchez.  OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and 
determined that there was no merit to it.  Specifically, in December 2018, after the Miami Herald 
investigative report renewed public attention to the case, Villafaña recounted in an email to a 
supervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.225  In the 
email, Villafaña stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s 
decision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the following:  “Months (or possibly years) 
later, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from.  He said 
that Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (attorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and 
convince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”   
OPR questioned both Villafaña and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.  
Villafaña told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends.  During her 
OPR interview, Villafaña explained:   
[A] lot later, I asked Jeff.  I said, you know, “Jeff, where did this two 
years come from?”  And he said, “Well, I always figured that . . . 
Lilly asked Matt to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a 
strange term, . . . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in 
Epstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came 
from.  Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff 
Sloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to 
remind him of that conversation.  So Jeff doesn’t know where the 
two years came from. 
Because the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafaña 
whether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to 
defense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafaña 
could not recall precisely what Sloman had said.  At a follow-up interview, Villafaña again said 
that she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Matt to do her 
a solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Matt just wanted . . . to do her a solid.”  Villafaña stated 
that she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of 
exchange of . . . a favor in either direction.” 
During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could 
not rule out the possibility that Villafaña, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard 
that in some fashion.”  He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafaña about Menchel having 
done “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s 
not something that I would have believed.  Him doing her a solid.  I mean that’s the furthest thing 
from my recollection or impression even after years later.”   
225  
Villafaña’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein 
investigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding.  In her email, Villafaña 
addressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 179 of 348

154 
Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social 
relationship, which included, in 2003, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks.  We 
decided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”226  
Apart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was known 
in the office at the time.  Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically” 
when she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein 
investigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely” 
have been at office events and when she attended his wedding.227  Menchel added, “[T]hat was 
three and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s 
thought.”  
When asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term 
of incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did 
not recall how the office arrived at that figure.  In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that 
his relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case.  Moreover, 
Menchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was 
Acosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.   
OPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements 
to OPR from Menchel, Villafaña, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence 
supporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.  
The USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26, 
2007, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal 
case with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration.  According to the 
email, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense.  In the lengthy email exchange with Villafaña in 
early July 2007, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution 
was made with Acosta’s “full knowledge.”  Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that 
although he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based 
resolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense 
counsel “without having discussed it with me.”228  Moreover, the defense did not immediately 
226  
Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2007, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated 
Sanchez.  OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an 
obligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship.  The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it 
would depend on “how long the relationship was and how compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,” 
but he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta.  The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR 
that if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity 
of the [Epstein] matter, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it 
over.”  Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of 
dates, he would have advised his supervisors.  Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with 
Sanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have 
informed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in 
the Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality. 
227  
Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early 
2006, after she left the USAO.   
228  
In addition, Villafaña recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2007 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer 
a two year state deal.”

155 
accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of 
home confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and 
did not view it as such.  The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of 
probation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail 
sentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early 
stages of the negotiations.     
As discussed below, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-
year offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the 
reasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to 
any other term of years.  Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of 
and approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.  
The only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of 
Menchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later.  Sloman, the 
purported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly 
disputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his 
understanding of that reason.  Villafaña herself could remember little about the critical 
conversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.  
Given the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence showing Epstein’s vigorous 
resistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in 
Villafaña’s 2018 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of 
Epstein’s attorneys.  
E. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense 
Counsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein 
OPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with 
defense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the 
NPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism 
toward or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.   
1. 
The Evidence Shows That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with 
Epstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations  
Although pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving 
financial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent 
in sex offense cases.  As the lead prosecutor, Villafaña vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s 
attorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them.  In Villafaña’s 
view, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those 
meetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 31, 2007 “term 
sheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”   
OPR’s investigation established that while the defense attorneys persistently contacted the 
subjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings 
actually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the matter.  As shown in the chart on the 
following page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed, 
the subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—

OPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests 
for in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual.  OPR questioned each of 
the four supervisory subject attorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with 
the defense.   
Lourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he 
told OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so.  Lourie 
recognized that some prosecutors—like Villafaña—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of 
“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is power,” and as long as the USAO did not share 
information with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all power to 
us.”  Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re getting the information that 
they think is important; that they’re going to focus on.  The witnesses that they think are liars . . . .  
And so you can form all of that into your strategy.”  Lourie also told OPR that giving defense 
counsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that 
helped ensure procedural fairness, allowing them to “believe that they are getting heard.”  When 
asked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever 
getting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that 
[Epstein’s attorneys] got.  But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”   
Menchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a 
defense attorney “an audience,” and there was no real “downside” to doing so.  Menchel added, 
“[W]hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being 
raised by the defense, and it’s good to know” what the defense will be.   
During his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel 
was unusual or outside the norm.  He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team, 
before the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense 
attorneys” who requested one.  Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Attorney to meet 
with opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution.  Sloman corroborated 
Acosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense attorneys, and that the 
USAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.”  Furthermore, 
Acosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense 
by the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements 
of the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual 
offender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.    
OPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the 
individual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic 
purpose.  The first meeting, on February 1, 2007, followed a phone call between Lourie and one 
of Epstein’s attorneys, in which the attorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the 
victims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview following that 
pitch.  Villafaña objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was 
not being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of 
Epstein.  The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follow-up 
meeting on February 20, 2007, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s 
witness interviews.  Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the 
defense arguments.  After Villafaña circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested

158 
preparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up 
already.”230  The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the 
victims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR 
that such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored 
into the government’s charging strategy.      
The two February 2007 Villafaña/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and 
claims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2007, defense attorneys requested 
another meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a 
presentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution.  The request was 
granted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to 
us . . . to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.”  The requested meeting 
took place on June 26, 2007.  Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafaña provided to 
the defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges.  Defense 
counsel used that information to prepare a 19-page letter, submitted to the USAO the day before 
the June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position.  In an email to his colleagues, 
Lourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments.  A 
contemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña viewed the meeting itself as 
primarily a “listening session.”231  After the meeting, Epstein’s team submitted a second lengthy 
letter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state 
handle the matter.   
Menchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 31, 2007, to 
facilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed 
terms of a non-prosecution agreement.     
By early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys—Starr and Lefkowitz—joined the 
defense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I 
have not met with them.”  A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for 
September 7, 2007, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafaña, and Oosterbaan met with Starr, Lefkowitz, 
and Sanchez.  In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense, 
with Oosterbaan participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.”  In another email to Sloman 
and Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhow, if we don’t meet 
with them.  I’d rather keep it here.  Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so.  If our deadline 
has to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.”  Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,” 
but a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments.  Acosta said that he had already 
decided how he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our 
position.”     
230  
Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have 
nothing on at all.”   
231  
During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the 
government’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break 
in the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense.  She did 
not recall specifics of the discussion, however.

159 
The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense attorneys, together with the 
State Attorney and the lead state prosecutor on September 12, 2007, was a necessary part of the 
NPA negotiation process.   
Even after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of 
the case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy 
Attorney General.  Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one 
substantive meeting with Acosta, on December 14, 2007.232  This meeting occurred in lieu of the 
meeting Starr had requested of Assistant Attorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense 
submissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with 
the USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.233  
Acosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear 
as if he “fear[ed]” that review.  Acosta’s nuanced position, however, was not clear to the 
Department attorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor 
of a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it.  Notably, though, none of those meetings 
or reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial 
advantage from his continued entreaties.   
In sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their 
purpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards.  OPR cannot say that the 
number of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside 
the norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense attorneys—that the quantity of meetings 
alone shows that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism.  In evaluating the subjects’ 
conduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and 
that the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic 
goals.  Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or 
Sloman knew or knew of the defense attorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it 
is also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense attorneys, including those who are known 
to them and those who are not.  Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile 
cases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request 
meetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department.  Most significantly, OPR did not 
find evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial 
benefit to the defense.  At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual, 
legal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the matter to the state to 
proceed as it saw fit.  The USAO never yielded on that point.  Accordingly, OPR did not find 
evidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafaña met with 
defense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused 
Acosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein. 
232  
Acosta’s October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz is discussed separately in the following section. 
233  
Starr and other defense attorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterbaan in March 2008.  Although Starr requested a meeting with 
Assistant Attorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Attorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.

2. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal 
Favorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel   
OPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the 
subject of media attention and public criticism.  The Miami Herald’s November 2018 reporting on 
the Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting that 
defense counsel Jay Lefkowitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriott 
hotel.  According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allow Epstein 
to serve “just 13 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shuttering of the federal 
investigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the 
victims and the public.234  Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that 
the meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shows that Acosta 
traveled to West Palm Beach on October 11 for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel, 
near the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October 12 he was to speak at 
the Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference.  After carefully considering the evidence 
surrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness 
accounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant 
concessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.   
Epstein and his attorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2007—more than two weeks 
before the October 12 breakfast meeting.  The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions 
resulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later 
addendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those 
key provisions remained in place thereafter.  Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations 
with the defense, he sought three goals:  (1) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense 
requiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism 
through which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein.  As noted previously, the 
USAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2007 letter expressed a “non-negotiable” 
demand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only 
an 18-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to 18 
months was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel.  The NPA signed on 
September 24, 2007, required 18 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a 
mechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these 
terms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.     
At the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, two issues involving 
the NPA were in dispute.  Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially 
changed the key provisions of the NPA.  First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change 
the mechanism for appointing an attorney representative for the victims.  This USAO-initiated 
request had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA.  Sloman sent the text of a 
proposed NPA addendum to Lefkowitz on October 11, 2007.235  Although OPR found no decisive 
234  
Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the 
deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018. 
235  
In his December 19, 2007, letter to defense attorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the 
addendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 186 of 348

161 
proof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkowitz and Acosta show 
that it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting.  Shortly after the 
breakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkowitz (copying Acosta and Villafaña), 
noting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the 
addendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the attorney representative.  Sloman later 
clarified for Villafaña that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”     
A second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s 
obligation under the NPA to pay the attorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the 
fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him.  Although this was at odds with the USAO’s 
interpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the 
provision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast 
meeting.  Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned 
attorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein 
under § 2255.    The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that 
Acosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue. 
OPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta 
and Lefkowitz.  In a letter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2007, two weeks after the breakfast 
meeting, Lefkowitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.  
Specifically, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (1) not to intervene with the State 
Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their 
counsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received.  Acosta told OPR that 
he did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense 
counsel attributed to him.  Acosta also told OPR that Lefkowitz was not a reliable narrator of 
events, and on several occasions in written communications had inaccurately and misleadingly 
characterized conversations he had with Acosta.   
Of more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an  
October 25, 2007 draft response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed 
and edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkowitz’s claims.  The draft letter stated:  
I specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was 
inaccurate in that October 23rd letter.  Your letter claimed that this 
Office 
would not intervene with the State Attorney’s Office 
regarding this matter; or contact any of the identified 
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil 
claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; 
and neither your Office nor the [FBI] would 
intervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein 
receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as 
that sentence does not violate state law.    
As we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States 
Attorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 187 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page189 of 258

162 
promise equates to the imposition of a gag order.  Our Office cannot 
and will not agree to this.   
It is the intent of this Office to treat this matter like any other case. 
Acosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkowitz for mischaracterizing 
what Acosta said during the breakfast meeting.  Although OPR could not find evidence that the 
letter was sent to Lefkowitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly 
after the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkowitz’s description of their discussions and had 
discussed those disagreements with Sloman.   
Nevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkowitz described in 
the October 23 letter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during 
the breakfast meeting.  First, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting 
that he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case.  Contemporaneous 
documents show that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did 
not want to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney or the state court.  For example, during the NPA 
negotiations, Acosta asked Villafaña to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State 
Attorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his 
guilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date.  Although Acosta may have 
made a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the 
state’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the 
subject, rather than any new concession.   
Lefkowitz also claimed in his October 23, 2007 letter that Acosta agreed not to contact any 
of the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel.  For the reasons discussed more fully in 
Chapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not 
stem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and 
considerations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta, 
Sloman, and Villafaña.   
Finally, Lefkowitz’s October 23 letter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene 
regarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was 
“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work 
release.”  Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, however, show clearly 
that Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision.  The NPA required Epstein 
to make a joint recommendation with the State Attorney’s Office for an 18-month jail sentence, 
although the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to 
all state inmates.  After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafaña, on behalf of the 
USAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also 
subsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release.  For example, in a November 5, 
2007 letter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by 
his agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that 
the Court impose a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.”  Shortly 
before Epstein entered his plea in June 2008, Villafaña wrote to the State Attorney to remind him 
that the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an 18-month 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 188 of 348
SA-188
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page190 of 258

163 
sentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement 
a breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”   
The guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2008 was consistent with the dictates 
of the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of 18 months’ incarceration.  
Epstein, however, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to 
serve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail.  The NPA did not reference work 
release nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County 
Stockade.  Moreover, Villafaña received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve 
his entire sentence of confinement “in custody.”  Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein 
work release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole 
authority for administering the work release program.  
After considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s 
October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest 
that the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served 
pursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work 
release.   
F. 
Villafaña’s Emails with Defense Attorney Lefkowitz during the NPA 
Negotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaña, or Other Subjects, Intended to 
Give Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or 
Other Improper Influences  
During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s attorney, and filed 
under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaña 
(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized, 
and thereafter.  These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkowitz’s side of the 
communications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafaña’s 
communications to Lefkowitz.  The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over 
Epstein’s objections.236  Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafaña’s emails as 
proof that Villafaña and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s attorneys to keep the 
“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public.  Statements in several emails in 
particular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism towards Epstein.  In one 
example, Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing 
not to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and 
all of the other persons that we could charge.”  She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’” 
to finalize negotiations.  She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal 
charges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press 
coverage.   
236  
The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal 
protected information.  United States’ Response to Petitioners’ Motion to Use Correspondence to Prove Violations of 
the [CVRA] and to Have Their Unredacted Pleadings Unsealed (Apr. 7, 2011).  The court declined to order the 
additional redactions.

164 
OPR asked Villafaña about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with 
Lefkowitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense attorneys generally.  Villafaña 
acknowledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the 
tone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her 
supervisors had assigned to her:  
[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find 
that that is how I communicate with people.  I’m a Minnesota girl, 
and I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be.  And I can 
be when I need to be.  But my instructions from my supervisors were 
to engage in these negotiations and to complete them.  So I felt that 
given that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the 
agreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had 
agreed to, and do that in a way that is civil.  So . . . although my 
language in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications 
with Mr. Lefkowitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at 
the terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes, 
my response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”  
Villafaña denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide 
an improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question.  The email 
in which Villafaña expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all 
of the other persons that we could charge” was written in response to a defense proposal to include 
in the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not 
to prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees.  Lefkowitz had proposed that the plea 
agreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the 
initiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against 
[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate entity] for 
any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”  Villafaña told OPR that 
the USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who 
could be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties.  However, 
Villafaña was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to 
require the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might 
lead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the 
court not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty.  Villafaña was not the 
only one to express concern about how deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether 
such probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement.  In an earlier email, Lourie 
had suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allow the USAO more flexibility in plea 
negotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that 
required dismissal of numerous substantive counts.    
As to Villafaña’s offer to meet with Lefkowitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues 
in the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a 
“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate 
completion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.

165 
With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafaña told OPR that her goal 
was to protect the anonymity of the victims.  She said that the case was far more likely to be 
covered by the Palm Beach press, which had already written articles about Epstein, than in Miami, 
and “if [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the 
courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.” 
In evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafaña, as well 
as Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkowitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted 
from the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did 
not locate in the USAO records).  OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of 
Villafaña’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein.  The documentary record, 
as well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafaña consistently advocated in favor 
of prosecuting Epstein and worked for months toward that goal.  She repeatedly pressed her 
supervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the 
case.  She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because 
her supervisors agreed to those meetings.  Villafaña objected to the decision to resolve the case 
through a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with 
Menchel about that subject.  When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect 
that resolution, Villafaña fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position 
despite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.    
OPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense 
counsel.  Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafaña “was soft on Epstein . . . 
couldn’t have been further from the truth.”  Sloman added that Villafaña “did her best to implement 
the decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.”  Lourie similarly told OPR that 
when he read the district court’s February 2019 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails 
from Villafaña cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see how nice she was to them.  And she 
winds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them.  When I know the whole time she was the 
one who wanted to go after him the most.”  The AUSA who assisted Villafaña on the investigation 
told OPR “everything that [Villafaña] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro 
prosecution.” 
Because the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other 
information showing Villafaña’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a 
public narrative developed that Villafaña colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the 
expense of the victims.  After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that 
narrative to be inaccurate.  The USAO’s and Villafaña’s interactions with the victims can be 
criticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps 
Villafaña may have made in her interactions with victims or their attorneys were not made for the 
purpose of silencing victims.  Rather, the evidence shows that Villafaña, in particular, cared deeply 
about Epstein’s victims.  Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of 
consulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted letters to notify victims 
identified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to 
appear.  The draft letters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafaña 
and Sloman committed professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and 
unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” of the listed victims.  Given the full context of Villafaña’s 
conduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 191 of 348

166 
entitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them.  OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in 
question do not themselves establish that Villafaña (or any other subject) acted to improperly 
benefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence 
victims.  
G. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña Agreed to 
the NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators” 
in Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential 
Associates  
OPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafaña, Lourie, 
and Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute 
“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine 
whether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism towards Epstein or an 
improper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s known associates.  Other than various 
drafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found little in the contemporaneous 
records mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—
or even gave it much consideration.  Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement show 
that the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” 
evolved from a more narrow provision sought by the defense.  The provision expanded as Villafaña 
and defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the 
NPA, with apparently little analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the 
provision.237   
As the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafaña circulated to Lourie and another 
supervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of 
[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and 
commenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.”  In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue 
237  
As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense 
sought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed 
employees of one of his companies.  Villafaña initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed 
“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that 
we could charge.”  Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkowitz after Villafaña’s email continued to include 
language referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees.  Villafaña, however, internally circulated 
drafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability 
of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal conduct by 
those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.”  The federal plea agreement draft revised 
by Lourie and Acosta on September 20, 2007, included that language.  When the defense team reverted to negotiation 
of state charges, Villafaña advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more 
willing to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.”  The next day, Lefkowitz sent a revised draft NPA 
referring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for 
any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”  The language was finally revised by Villafaña 
to prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named 
assistants].”   
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafaña’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution 
provision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges 
and a time-limited scope of conduct.  Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain 
such limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 192 of 348

167 
Villafaña had raised (defense counsel’s attempt to insert an immigration waiver into the 
agreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-
conspirators or ask Villafaña to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the 
government’s interests.  In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafaña asked Lourie for 
“[a]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input.  OPR found no 
document that suggested Villafaña and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other 
individuals who were copied on Villafaña’s email referencing the provision—her immediate 
supervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office, 
and Villafaña’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it.  Villafaña told 
OPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-
prosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafaña assumed that they agreed with her assessment. 
Villafaña told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision 
agreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that 
defense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame 
for what happened.”  Villafaña told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct 
was his own “dirty little secret.”  Villafaña said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2006 
arrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that 
none of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators 
about sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-known contacts about whom allegations arose 
many years later.238  Villafaña acknowledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime 
relationship with a close female friend who was a well-known socialite, but, according to 
Villafaña, in 2007, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”239  Accordingly, Villafaña 
believed that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the 
four female assistants identified by name.240  Villafaña also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s 
investigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he 
entered a plea.241  Because Villafaña was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged, 
she perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified 
“co-conspirators.”  Villafaña told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did 
not occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any 
of Epstein’s influential associates.   
Lourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the 
time Villafaña forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR 
that he did not know how the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.  
238  
Villafaña told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being 
involved in abusing them.  It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”   
239  
The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct 
involving the then minor did not occur in Florida.   
240  
The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one 
girl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the 
government’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset.  Villafaña explained to OPR that this individual was herself 
believed to also have been at one time a victim. 
241  
Villafaña told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 193 of 348

168 
Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told 
OPR that he did not know why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike 
me if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehow helpful.”  Lourie 
posited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein 
“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators.  He told OPR that when he saw the 
provision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to 
any victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”  
Acosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision.  But he told 
OPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed 
the federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful 
consequences” for his actions.  Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the 
extent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been 
the focus is on Epstein[ ] . . . going to jail.  Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other, 
lesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.”  Acosta also told OPR that he assumed 
Villafaña and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate.  Finally, 
Sloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood 
the non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never 
dawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else. 
This broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is 
troubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence showing that 
the subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was 
warranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete 
information regarding possible co-conspirators.  Villafaña precipitously revised a more narrow 
provision sought by the defense.  Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it 
appears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the 
time, the subjects believed that was the purpose.  However, the USAO had not indicated interest 
in prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record 
indicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the 
four assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company.  Accordingly, OPR 
concludes that the evidence does not show that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña agreed to the non-
prosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential 
associates.242        
H. 
OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein 
Cooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on 
That Basis 
One final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may 
have received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal 
242  
As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafaña included the provision in draft plea agreements 
and did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.  
Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2007, before the parties drafted the NPA.

169 
investigation.243  Media reports in mid-2009 suggested Epstein was released from his state 
incarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern 
District of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns.  At the time, Villafaña 
was notified by the AUSAs handling the matter that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was 
providing “absolutely no cooperation” to the government.  In 2011, Villafaña reported to senior 
colleagues that “this is urban myth.  The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of 
it is true.”  Villafaña told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New 
York was “completely false.”  Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein 
cooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an 
“intelligence asset.”244   
In addition to the contemporaneous record attesting that Epstein was not a cooperating 
witness in a federal matter, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating 
witness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s 
investigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a 
basis.  OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion 
that he had assisted in a different matter, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense 
counsel to the USAO and the Department.  It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have 
omitted any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.   
Accordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided 
Epstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal 
investigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for 
cooperation in any matter. 
V. 
ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA 
Although OPR finds that none of the subjects committed professional misconduct in this 
matter, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal 
investigation through the NPA.  Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case 
and his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the 
federal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to 
manipulate the conditions of his sentence to his own advantage.  The NPA relied on state 
authorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over 
the process.  Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA, 
such as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release 
and mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision.  Important provisions, such as promising 
not to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with little discussion or consideration 
by the prosecutors.  In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a 
243  
See, e.g., Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex 
abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.      
244  
When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2019 press conference, in answering a 
media question about whether he had knowledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that 
“the answer is no.”  Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified setting to discuss intelligence information. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 195 of 348

170 
successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately 
addressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by 
obtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment.  Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO 
compounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of 
drafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed attention and review than it 
received.  These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and 
potentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.   
In evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that 
some of Epstein’s conduct known today was not known in 2007 and that other circumstances have 
changed in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify.  OPR has also evaluated 
Acosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allows for decisions that are made in good 
faith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could 
have been obtained.  Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality 
of the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he 
chose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would 
reasonably expect of an attorney exercising good judgment.  
A. 
Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea 
under Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application 
of the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the 
Significant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution  
The Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court 
opinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the power to 
prosecute for the same act.  Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in 
a rule permitting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining 
to bring a federal prosecution following a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except 
when necessary to advance a compelling federal interest.  See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 
at 28.  On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follow completed state 
prosecutions.  USAM § 9-2.031 (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state . . . 
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, 
or a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”).  When 
a state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply.  Indeed, even when 
a state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal 
prosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied:  a “substantial federal interest” 
exists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal 
interest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction 
on federal charges.  The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a 
minor part of the contemplated federal charges.”  
No one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial 
interest in prosecuting Epstein.  In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña identified five federal 
statutes that Epstein had potentially violated.  The CEOS Chief described Villafaña’s assessment 
of these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the 
facts of the case.  Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel, 
and the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 196 of 348
SA-196
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page198 of 258

171 
Notably, in the early 2000s, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child 
sex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the 
PROTECT Act.  Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal 
interest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and 
the number of victims.   
It is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not 
reached a conviction, acquittal, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and 
certainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein.  He had been charged with one state 
charge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons 
without regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct 
under federal investigation.  Acosta acknowledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did 
not apply.  Moreover, the State Attorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption 
of prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding 
with the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement.  In these 
circumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication 
of the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.  
The federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual 
who engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had 
residences outside of Florida.  Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has little doubt that the 
USAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under 
the circumstances of this case.245   
Despite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy 
did not apply, and the State Attorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance 
pending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s 
role in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.246  In essence, Acosta believed 
that a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority.  He 
explained his reasoning to OPR: 
245  
In 2008, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver 
requests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would 
not apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim.  The office also noted that if other factors 
existed, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.  
246  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s 
concerns from those of the other subjects.  However, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his 
subordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal 
theories, he alone focused on federalism issues.  Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and 
devalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and 
counsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal 
issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater 
harm to trafficking victims.”  Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was 
appropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-
trafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the matter through the NPA, which, 
for the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and allowed Epstein to manipulate the 
state system to his benefit.

172 
[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so 
here is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign . . . 
state, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind . . . the 
whole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state . . . 
is an independent entity, and that we should presume that what 
they’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except 
in the most unusual of circumstances. 
Acosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein 
would have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis.  In 
Acosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-
stop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”247  Acosta told OPR 
that he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s attention if the State 
Attorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration.  Acosta therefore decided that 
the USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein 
to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.   
Acosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted.  Acosta’s repeated references to a 
“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used 
in the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with 
a criminal case after a completed state prosecution.  Nothing in the Petite policy, however, requires 
similar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state 
prosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense.  The goal of the Petite 
policy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal 
government to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials 
involved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions 
regarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case.  Acosta told OPR that “there are any 
number of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state 
charges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and 
lets the state proceed.”  The fact that the federal government can allow the state to proceed with a 
prosecution, however, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in 
a matter in which a distinct and important federal interest exists.  Indeed, the State Attorney told 
OPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators, 
typically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”   
Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.248  
Despite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily 
provable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a little bit more” does not approach 
that standard.  In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent 
an “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,” 
and that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from 
the PBPD, the outcome might have been different.  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to

Villafaña estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was 168 to 210 months’ imprisonment.

depart from the Ashcroft Memo.  He told OPR, however, that he did not recall discussing the 
Ashcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record 
suggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal 
investigation through the NPA.  Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension 
between federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and 
his broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other 
hand.  OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
too narrowly and through the wrong prism. 
Furthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy 
resulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision 
to pursue a federal prosecution would have.249  By means of the NPA, the federal government 
dictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had 
to obtain during the state’s own prosecution.  Acosta acknowledged during his OPR interview that 
his “attempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being 
arguably more intrusive.”     
Acosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative 
consequences.  Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting 
provisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain 
actions to the state.  In so doing, however, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement, 
making it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.  
OPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a 
mechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages 
of having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had 
practiced and with which they were unfamiliar.  Villafaña recognized that there were “a lot of ways 
to manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of 
negotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO 
was “giving up all control over what was going on.”  Villafaña also told OPR that defense counsel 
“had a lot of experience with the state system.  We did not.”  Epstein’s ability to obtain work 
release, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a 
clear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended 
on a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.  
Although the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject 
attorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be 
eligible for work release.  Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind 
of work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.”  Because work release was not 
anticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein 
from applying for admission to the program.       
249  
The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions.  It does not prevent state 
authorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution.  See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v. 
Nichols (dual prosecution for acts committed in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building).  However, in 
practice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the 
federal prosecution results in a conviction.

174 
The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of how Acosta’s decision 
to create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal 
investigation led to unanticipated consequences benefitting Epstein.  Acosta told OPR that one of 
the core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge 
requiring registration as a sexual offender.  He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the 
beginning and from which he never wavered.  However, the USAO failed to anticipate certain 
factors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had 
a residence.  In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender 
registration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least 16 at the time of her 
interactions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a 14-year old victim.  
The victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a 
residence, was 16; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state.  As a 2006 letter 
from defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Attorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had 
thoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration 
requirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the 
USAO.          
Finally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s attention 
because of a concern that the State Attorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense 
counsel.  Villafaña told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with 
them at the start of the federal investigation.  Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with 
Villafaña, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was 
dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case.  Shortly before the NPA was 
signed, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Attorney’s Office 
was predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor.  Specifically, during the 
September 12, 2007 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with 
Acosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation 
of minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally 
specified.  The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to 
register as a sexual offender.  Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite 
the assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned 
out—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.  
Yet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been 
considered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about 
proceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful 
execution.     
OPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by 
this case.  He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman 
and Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for 
their assessment of trial issues.  Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and 
revised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement.  Yet, rather than focusing on whether 
the state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta 
focused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in 
part by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of

175 
Epstein’s state guilty plea.250  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in 
this manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to 
do so reflected poor judgment.  Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive, 
his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrow, and his understanding of 
the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.251   
B. 
The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was 
Undermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative 
Steps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case 
The leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also 
troubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing 
evidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant 
leverage in negotiating with Epstein.  Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal 
investigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and 
concerns about whether the government could win at trial.  Yet, Acosta made the decision to 
resolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense 
attorneys before the investigation was completed.  As the investigation progressed, the FBI 
continued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time 
of the initial offer.  In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not know the 
full scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences, 
his criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might 
implicate other offenders.  In addition, Villafaña planned to approach the female assistants to 
attempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.252   Most importantly, Acosta ended 
the investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially 
significant evidence:  the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution 
of a search warrant.  
The PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home, 
which potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state 
250  
Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state, 
he would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to 
the FBI.  OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-
year sentence.  OPR’s investigation confirmed, however, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD 
Chief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the matter. 
251  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion 
that deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Attorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or 
a federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.”  Acosta also acknowledged that the USAO’s handling of the matter 
“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and attention.  No one foresaw the additional challenges that the 
chosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel 
too much wiggle-room.”  Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not 
challenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”  
252  
Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafaña identified three of his female 
assistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no 
significant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein.  The FBI attempted unsuccessfully to make 
contact with two female assistants on August 27, 2007, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands, 
but agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.

176 
search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those 
cameras had been removed.  Villafaña knew who had possession of the computer equipment.  
Surveillance images might have shown the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their 
appearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated 
argument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors.  The surveillance video might have 
shown additional victims the investigators had not yet identified.  Such images could have been 
powerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their 
visits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation” 
case.   
Epstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence.  Villafaña 
told OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence 
to record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed 
her in the nude.  Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors, 
Villafaña and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained 
child pornography.  Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume 
that he may have transmitted still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet 
to be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling.  The interstate transmission of 
child pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire 
complexion of the case against Epstein.253  Villafaña told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what 
we suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed.  It also would have 
completely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”   
Because she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafaña attempted to 
obtain the missing computers.  After Villafaña learned that an individual associated with one of 
Epstein’s attorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s 
home, she consulted with Department subject matter experts to determine how best to obtain the 
evidence.  Following the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafaña took 
legal steps to obtain the computer equipment.   
Epstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the 
equipment.  In late June 2007, defense attorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply; 
in informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafaña stressed that “we want to get 
the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant 
as soon as possible.”  She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one 
week until July 17, 2007.  On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer 
equipment.  That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve

commerce or in or affecting interstate . . . commerce . . . [or] if that visual depiction 
was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or

the federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year 
sentence.  The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which 
the FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a 
resolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug” 
without comment.  Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent 
recalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending. 
Even after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafaña 
continued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of 
the computer equipment.  On August 10, 2007, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose 
Epstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the 
defense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein 
at age 14 and had been photographed in the nude.  A few days later, Villafaña told defense counsel 
that she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”  
Defense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the 
upcoming meeting with Acosta.  After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the 
hearing, Villafaña emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off”; he replied, “Yes,” and the 
hearing was re-set for September 18, 2007.  As negotiations towards the NPA progressed, 
however, the hearing was postponed indefinitely.  Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest 
by specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached 
the agreement.   
Villafaña told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense 
team had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers.  She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact 
that the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the 
importance of the evidence.”    
OPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA 
negotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to 
postpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer 
evidence.  Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafaña’s efforts to obtain the missing 
computers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slowly” 
regarding the plea.     
Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafaña’s 
efforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.”  Menchel expressed surprise 
to OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by 
Villafaña, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.”  However, the contemporaneous records show 
that Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2007 of Villafaña’s efforts to obtain 
Epstein’s missing computer equipment.   
Villafaña kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer 
equipment.  She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the 
computer equipment; specifically, her emails on May 18, 2007, July 3, 2007, and July 16, 2007, 
all discussed her proposed steps.  Villafaña told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions 
about her proposal to obtain the evidence.  Lourie also received Villafaña’s July 16, 2007 email 
discussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 203 of 348

178 
with one of Epstein’s defense attorneys about it.  Sloman told OPR during his interview that he 
“vaguely” remembered the computer issue.  The documentary evidence confirms that he had at 
least some contemporaneous knowledge of the issue—when asked by Villafaña whether to put off 
a September 12, 2007 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so.  Finally, as noted previously, 
the FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the 
litigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.     
Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed 
of the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed, 
he was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment.  The NPA 
itself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process] 
will be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain 
[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal 
process] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the 
NPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed 
withdrawn.”  (Emphasis added.)  Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he 
gave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without 
understanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of 
evidence specified was “certain computer equipment.”  In addition, Acosta told OPR that he 
worked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about 
the case.  Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the 
evidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial.  Therefore, although it is possible that 
Sloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the 
computer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was 
on notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer 
equipment.    
Villafaña knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment 
was already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and 
potentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his 
computers disclosed.  Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefitted from 
abandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration 
of the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.254  
Instead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that 
could have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state 
guilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges.  By agreeing to postpone the litigation, 
the USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much 
earlier and on terms more favorable to the government.  The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in 
the NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant 
crimes and did so with apparently little serious consideration of the potential cost.    
254  
If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as 
leverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable.  Lourie suggested in his response to his interview 
transcript that the court might have precluded production of the computers.  However, OPR saw no evidence indicating 
that Villafaña or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafaña had consulted with the 
Department’s subject matter experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.

179 
To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence 
before reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a 
resolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues.  Every case is different 
and must be judged on its own facts.  In this case, however, given the unorthodox nature of the 
state-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different 
track than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of 
Epstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from 
Epstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal 
conduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences 
of pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flowing 
from the express terms of the NPA.  In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight 
of the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be 
pursued.  The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to 
pursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of 
all the costs and benefits of the proposed action.  OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully 
considered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.255    
C. 
OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of 
Incarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It 
Satisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution  
The heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency 
afforded him concerning his sentence.  After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable” 
24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an 18-month term of incarceration, 
knowing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only 13 months.  
Epstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis 
because the state allowed Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his 
sentence.  As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what 
should have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money.  He had to register as a sex 
offender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”   
Due to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant 
events, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of how the original two-year sentence 
requirement was developed or by whom.  Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject 
interviews:  (1) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled 
guilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years 
represented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding 
the need for a trial.  As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of 
the two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”  He elaborated, 
255  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or 
should have known about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration 
to pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed.  Acosta’s attorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in 
that level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that 
it was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him.  For the reasons stated above, OPR 
nonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater 
obligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.

180 
“I’m reconstructing memories of . . . 12 years ago.  I can speculate that at some point, the matter 
came up, and I or someone else said . . . what would the original charges have likely brought?  And 
someone said this amount.”  Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this 
method, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather 
from conversations over a course of time.  Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had 
these discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman.  Villafaña was 
not asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it 
was made.  Villafaña told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a 
state charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence.  OPR also examined applicable state 
statutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact, 
facing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD. 
 On the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehow the 
defense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.”  Menchel similarly told 
OPR that he did not know how the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number 
that the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it.  Sloman told OPR that he 
had no idea how the two-year sentence proposal was reached.   
The contemporaneous documentary record, however, provides no indication that Epstein’s 
team proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made 
its offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration.  As late as July 25, 2007—
only days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel 
submitted a letter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein 
at all.  Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA 
progressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.   
The USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it.  The most obvious 
alternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that 
carried a harsher sentence.  If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under 
the federal sentencing guidelines, 168 to 210 months’ imprisonment.  However, it is unlikely that 
he would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the lower end of 
the guidelines.  Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein 
would opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines 
sentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks attendant upon 
a trial in this case.  If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed 
by offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c) for a stipulated sentence, 
which requires judicial approval.  Acosta rejected this idea, however, apparently because of a 
perception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule 11(c) 
pleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.   
Another alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried 
a maximum five-year sentence.  Shortly after Villafaña circulated the prosecution memorandum 
to her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and 
offering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea attractive.”  Similarly, before learning that Menchel 
had already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafaña had considered 
offering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served 
concurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding

181 
indictment.  Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and 
defense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is 
questionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even 
extend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.   
Weighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution 
that ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a 
mechanism for the victims to recover damages.  These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern 
about intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would 
be sufficient to prevent manifest injustice.  Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the 
time that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of 
the conduct.  I think that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not if we took this case to 
trial, would we risk losing everything?”  
During the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept 
a plea for an 18-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-
year term.  The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made.  Villafaña 
attributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, but Acosta attributed it to a decision 
made during the negotiating process by Villafaña and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his 
attorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.  
OPR found no contemporaneous documents showing the basis for the two-year term.  
Despite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR 
was unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that 
term, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was settled on for the initial offer.  The 
term was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as 
OPR could determine, possible state charges.  Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the 
defense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and 
rather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the 
negotiations.  OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was 
tied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other 
traditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar 
crimes.  Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a 
punishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed.  As a result, the 
USAO had little room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to 
enforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration 
that was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly 
disproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.    
In sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him 
to arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his own goal of serving as a “backstop” to the 
state, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis.  In assessing the case 
only through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for 
a punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in 
addressing it.

D. 
Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA  
After the agreement was reached, the collateral attacks and continued appeals raised the 
specter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith.  At various points, individual members of the 
USAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given 
to whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach.  Indeed, on November 24, 2008, the 
USAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the 
agreement but ultimately took no further action.  Acosta told OPR:  “I was personally very 
frustrated with the failure to report on October 20, and had I envisioned that entire collateral attack, 
I think I would have looked at this very differently.”  
Once the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review 
by the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state 
guilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally.  When 
questioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to 
address Epstein’s concerns.  He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of 
Justice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object.  During his 
OPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he attributed to Acosta’s 
prior Department experience.  Sloman, however, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much 
process,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to 
keep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA.  Furthermore, Epstein’s 
defense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.  
Acosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order 
to proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort 
to obtain Departmental review constituted a breach.  Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was 
Sloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in 
collateral litigation that would further delay matters and make what was likely a difficult trial even 
harder. 
Acosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable.  A court 
would have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the 
Department and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient 
to negate the agreement.  However, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach 
was caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed.  For example, 
and significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and 
be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his 
guilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007.”  (Emphasis added.)  Acosta also 
agreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2007 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told 
defense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.  
Following these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that 
Epstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to 
comply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Attorney had at least implicitly agreed.   
E. 
Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process 
The question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s 
handling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 208 of 348

183 
the defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant 
term of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense.  As OPR has set forth 
in substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the 
prosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims.  Instead, the result can more 
appropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state 
crime and intruding on state authority.  Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had 
set, even when Villafaña and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta 
himself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.   
Many of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in 
greater consultation with his staff before making key decisions.  The contemporaneous records 
revealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants.  Acosta 
was involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case.  Lourie 
told OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Attorney get involved with this level of detail.”  
Menchel told OPR, “I know we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay?  And I’m sure with 
Jeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”  
Lourie similarly told OPR: 
Well, . . . he would have been talking to Jeff and Matt, talking to me 
to the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros 
Memo and . . . the guidance from CEOS, he would have been 
reading the defense attorney’s letters, maybe talking to the State 
Attorney, I don’t know, just . . . all these different sources of 
information he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you 
know, that he was, he was reading everything.  Apparently, he, you 
know, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff . . . .   
At the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels 
in the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knowledge of the facts of the case—
Villafaña and, to a lesser extent, Lourie.  Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution 
memorandum on his own, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through 
the front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.”  Yet, although 
Acosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as 
overseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions.  OPR observed that as a 
consequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ownership of the 
investigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.   
On occasion, Villafaña included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon 
which Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made 
traveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafaña.  Villafaña did draft a detailed, 
analytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have 
relied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.  
Despite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such 
as Oosterbaan’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafaña’s 
concerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA.  Acosta interpreted the state 
indictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that 
when making his decision to resolve the matter though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 209 of 348

184 
which Villafaña and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue 
a broader state indictment.   
One example illustrates this communication gap.  In a September 20, 2007 email to Lourie 
asking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for 
Epstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea 
agreements.  We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.  I 
didn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”  
(Emphasis added.)  In his email to Villafaña, Lourie attached Acosta’s email and instructed 
Villafaña to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkowitz].”  
(Emphasis added.)  Villafaña raised no objection to signing the agreement.  Acosta told OPR that 
he wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him know” if they did not feel 
comfortable with the agreement.  Villafaña, however, told OPR that she did not understand that 
she was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted 
her to sign it because he was taking an “arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his 
deal.”  The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity 
to reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA 
believed she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself 
from the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.   
As another example, at one point, Villafaña, frustrated and concerned about the decisions 
being made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded 
rebuke, Menchel rejected the request.  Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting 
Villafaña from speaking to Acosta, Villafaña interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could 
not seek a meeting with Acosta.  As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state 
resolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafaña.  Acosta told OPR 
that he was unaware that Villafaña had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with 
her if she had asked him directly.  OPR did not find any written evidence of a meeting involving 
both Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafaña—the person most knowledgeable about the 
facts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to 
offer the two-year term, and Villafaña said she did not have any input into the decision.  Although 
a U.S. Attorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel 
presented what he believed to be Villafaña’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware 
of Villafaña’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.256   
Two logistical problems hindered effective communication.  First, the senior managers 
involved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the 
offices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafaña and, to a lesser extent, 
Lourie—were located in West Palm Beach.  Consequently, Villafaña’s discussions with her senior 
256  
In her 2017 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that, given the challenges of obtaining 
victims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the matter 
was in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole.  The [USAO] had also reached that same 
conclusion.”  Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafaña in fact supported the NPA.  In her 
OPR interview, however, Villafaña drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that 
led to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—
that is, the NPA—which she did not support.

185 
managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop 
by a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.257   
Second, key personnel were absent at varying times.  Menchel’s last day in the office was 
August 3, 2007, the day he sent to the defense his letter making the initial offer, and presumably 
in the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his 
outstanding work.  Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding how to resolve the matter.  
Similarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the 
NPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key 
provisions were continuously added or modified while Villafaña pressed to meet her late-
September deadline.  Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he 
was at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was 
traveling between the two locations.  Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing, 
when many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting 
or reviewing the NPA before it was signed.  Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a 
significant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding 
of the case and full ownership of the decisions that were being made.  Villafaña certainly felt that 
during the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta.  Acosta, however, 
told OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns.  Did 
it do the . . . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and 
Marie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”    
The consequences flowing from the lack of ownership and effective communication can 
be seen in the NPA itself.  As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the 
negotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited 
proposals previously rejected.  Meanwhile, Villafaña sought to keep to a deadline that would allow 
her to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement.  In the end, 
Acosta accepted several terms with little apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications. 
The USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable 
example.   As previously noted, the only written discussion about the term that OPR found was 
Villafaña’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her 
co-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and 
neither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafaña recalled any further discussion about the provision.  Although 
OPR did not find evidence showing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña intended the scope of the 
provision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision 
precluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct, 
within the limitations set by the overall agreement.  This broad prosecution declination would 
likely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient 
investigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no 
other individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not 
be developed implicating others.  Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third 
257  
In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s, 
he was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”

186 
parties.258  The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a 
significant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification 
for the provision.  It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have 
itself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning 
immigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement.  The 
possibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal 
culpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused 
more careful consideration of the provision.          
Similarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with little apparent consideration 
of the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense 
interpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of 
the investigation.  Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release 
information as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would 
be violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master. 
Decisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province 
of the USAO to decide as it saw fit.     
There is nothing improper about a U.S. Attorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA 
or other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given 
case; indeed, U.S. Attorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.  
And Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical 
decision to resolve the matter through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could 
not be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time.  This case, however, was different 
from the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the 
usual plea agreement.  Contemporaneous records show that Acosta believed the case should be 
handled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case 
unlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight.  Acosta may 
well have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing 
258  
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR this provision was “very unusual.”  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney 
General John Roth commented, “I don’t know how it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified.  I 
just don’t know how that works.”  Villafaña’s co-counsel told OPR:   
[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed 
to do at the Department of Justice. . . .  I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . . .  
[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for 
example, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense 
which was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and 
nobody else.  I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was 
dealing drugs and their wife was involved. . . . And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s 
understood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you 
know the husband’s willing to go and take the weight . . . .  This is not one of 
those. 
Deputy Attorney General Filip called the provision “pretty weird.”   Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR 
that he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor.  A senior AUSA with substantial 
experience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for 
participants in such conduct.

187 
from Villafaña and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision 
should have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and 
consequences of pushing the matter into the state court system, with which neither Villafaña nor 
the other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and 
possible means of overcoming those issues.  OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a 
meeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the 
state-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or 
before the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed.  As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,  
“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done 
and get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate how this train is 
moving?” 
Many features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions 
like the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able 
to manipulate the process to his benefit.  Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about 
some of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.  
There does not seem to be a point, however, at which those differing opinions were considered 
when forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him 
followed and attempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond attaining the three 
core elements.  As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of 
the problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful 
approach.  As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellow U.S. Attorney today, I 
would say, think it through.”259 
No one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor 
judgment by itself.  However, in combination, the evidence shows that the state-based resolution 
was ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process. 
From the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in 
prosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the 
investigation on a path not originally contemplated.  Having done so, he had responsibility for 
ensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before putting an end to 
a federal investigation into serious criminal conduct.  Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the 
full ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the 
line AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question 
the motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.  
Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of 
action that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an 
attorney exercising good judgment to take. 
259  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney acknowledged that “[t]he matter would have 
benefited from more consistent staffing and attention.”

CHAPTER THREE 
ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS  
AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS 
PART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
Chapter Three describes the events pertaining to the federal government’s interactions and 
communications with victims in the Epstein case, and should be read in conjunction with the 
factual background set forth in Chapter Two, Part One.  This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal 
authorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation, 
as well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions.  OPR discusses key events relating to the USAO’s and 
the FBI’s interactions with victims before and after the signing of the NPA, beginning with the 
FBI’s initial contact with victims through letters informing them that the FBI had initiated an 
investigation.  A timeline of key events is provided on the following page. 
II. 
THE CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 
A. 
History 
In December 1982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report 
outlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime 
victims.  The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice 
have gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone 
unattended.”260  Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the 
criminal justice system:  the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act 
of 1984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and 
Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the 
Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, and the Justice for All Act of 2004.261      
The CVRA, enacted on October 30, 2004, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed 
to protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”262  The 
CVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional 
amendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’

Bill of Rights in the VRRA.263  Following multiple Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee 
hearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an 
amendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise 
measure.264   
B. 
Enumerated Rights 
The CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed 
as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”265  
Initially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime 
victims the following eight rights: 
(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.  
(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public 
court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or 
of any release or escape of the accused.  
(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court 
proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing 
evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be 
materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that 
proceeding.  
(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the 
district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole 
proceeding.  
(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case.  
263  
See 150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004).  The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (1) be treated with 
fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender; 
(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the 
court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial; 
(5) confer with an attorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction, 
sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender.  42 U.S.C. § 10606(b) (1990).  The relevant text of the VRRA 
is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section 1.B of this Report. 
264  
150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004).  Although nine congressional hearings were held between 1996 and 
2003 concerning amending the Constitution to address victims’ rights, neither chamber of Congress voted on 
legislation proposing an amendment.  United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), GAO-09-54, Report 
to Congressional Committees:  Crime Victims’ Rights Act – Increasing Awareness, Modifying the Complaint Process 
and Enhancing Compliance Monitoring Will Improve Implementation of the Act at 16 (Dec. 2008) (GAO CVRA 
Awareness Report).     
265  
The relevant text of the CVRA is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section I.A of this Report.

192 
(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.  
(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.  
(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the 
victim’s dignity and privacy. 
Although many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part 
of the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or 
by administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights 
were afforded.  The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C. 
§ 10606), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to 
provide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C. 
§ 10607(c)).  Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide 
victim services, which attach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-
enforceable rights that attach upon the filing of a charging instrument.   
In 2015, Congress amended the CVRA and added the following two rights:266 
(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain 
or deferred prosecution agreement.  
(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the 
services described in section 503(c) of the Victims’ Rights and

Department of Justice. 
III. 
THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF 
“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION 
A. 
April 1, 2005 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review” 
In 2005, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s 
Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime 
victim.”267  On April 1, 2005, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email, 
concluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon 
the filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or 
prosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”268    
266  
H. Rep. No. 114-7 (Jan. 27, 2015). 
267  
OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive 
branch agencies.   
268  
The OLC 2005 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Attorney 
General from Deputy Assistant Attorney General John E. Bies (Dec. 17, 2010), published as Office of Legal Counsel, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 218 of 348
SA-218
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page220 of 258

193 
OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and 
proximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus 
tethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a 
complaint.”  OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies 
the “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the 
‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have 
intended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.   
OLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation.  For 
example, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect.  Additionally, 
the second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings 
involving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a 
complaint.” 
B. 
2005 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance 
In May 2005, the Department updated its Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and 
Witness Assistance (2005 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.269  The 2005 Guidelines specifically 
cited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution 
of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their 
CVRA rights, which in 2005 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.   
The 2005 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA 
duties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a 
“corrections stage.”  The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights 
varied depending on the stage of the proceedings.   
During the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency, 
the Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest 
opportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and 
services available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.   
[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates 
compliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C 
§ 10607, which requires federal officials to, among other things, 
identify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive 
reasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide 
The Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 (Dec. 17, 2010) (“OLC 
Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2010)”) and available at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/ 
opinions/2010/12/31/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf.  “That [2005] informal guidance did not foreclose the 
possibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.”  OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2010) at 1.   
269 
The 2005 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.  The 
Department promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA, 
which instructed the Attorney General to develop and implement such guidelines.  Victim and Witness Protection Act, 
Pub. L. No. 97-291, § 6, 96 Stat. 1248 (1982).  The 2005 Guidelines were superseded in October 2011, as explained 
below.

information about available services for victims.  Therefore, even 
though [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if 
charges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may 
provide certain services to victims that may serve the same function 
as some CVRA rights.270 
The 2005 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges 
are filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.”  The “U.S. Attorney in whose 
district the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime 
victims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.   
During the prosecution stage, the 2005 Guidelines required the U.S. Attorney, or a 
designee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an 
offender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or 
rendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed.  The 2005 Guidelines required the responsible 
official to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court 
proceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”   
The 2005 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult 
with victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea 
negotiations, and pretrial diversion.  In particular, the 2005 Guidelines required the responsible 
official to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views 
about, prospective plea negotiations.  Nevertheless, the 2005 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to 
“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the 
victim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves 
confidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case 
and the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”  
Lastly, the 2005 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather 
than withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”  
The “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration 
following a conviction.  Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S. 
Attorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.    
IV. 
USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME 
OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION 
A. 
USAO Training 
As U.S. Attorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2005 updated Guidelines to USAO 
personnel with a transmittal memorandum dated February 27, 2006, stating that he expected each 
recipient “to read and become familiar with the [2005] Guidelines.”  Acosta noted in the 
memorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2005 
Guidelines and that new USAO attorneys who missed the training were required to view a 
videotaped version of the training “immediately.”  Acosta further noted that the USAO’s 
270

195 
victim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other 
areas for which United States Attorney[’]s Offices are now explicitly responsible under the act.”  
The USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual 
mandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.  
B. 
The Automated Victim Notification System 
Both the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim 
Notification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United 
States Attorneys.  The 2005 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to 
victims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or 
foreign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.”  The VNS is separate from agency 
case management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO.  Both the FBI and the USAO 
use the VNS to generate form letters to victims at various points in the investigation and the 
prosecution of a criminal case.  Although each form letter can be augmented to add some limited 
individual matter-specific content, the letters contain specific language concerning the purpose of 
the contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a 
sentencing hearing).271   
In the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during 
the investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system.  The FBI’s Victim Specialist 
exports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS 
database.  Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.  
At the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate 
seven different form notification letters:  (1) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation; 
(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights; 
and (7) investigation closed.   
After a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s 
Victim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.272  The USAO imports 
data from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS 
data.  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form letters providing 
notice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of 
plea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.     
271  
U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report 08-04, The Department of 
Justice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2008), available at https://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUSA/a0804/ 
final.pdf.  The 2008 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the 
format to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information 
in notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in 
the same letter.”   
272  
The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact:  the FBI title is 
“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”

196 
C. 
FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets 
The 2005 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that 
briefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-
witness coordinator or specialist . . . .”  At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents 
nationwide routinely followed a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for 
Victims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.”  The “Help for 
Victims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights.  The pamphlet stated:  
“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime, 
and it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you 
are afforded those rights.”  The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided 
victims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.  The pamphlet entitled “The 
Department of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and 
instructions on how to access the system.      
V. 
THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS 
A. 
August 2006:  The FBI Victim Notification Letters 
On August 8, 2006, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim 
Specialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim 
Notification Form” naming 30 victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional 
pertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.273  Thereafter, the Victim Specialist 
entered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS 
whenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial letter to a particular 
victim.  The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the 
[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”274    
According to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2006, the FBI Victim Specialist 
used the VNS to generate FBI letters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the 
eight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive 
current status information about the matter.  The FBI letters described the case as “currently under 
investigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued 
patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.”  The letters also stated that some of the 
CVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment:  “We will make our best efforts 
to ensure you are accorded the rights described.  Most of these rights pertain to events occurring 
after the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility 
of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.”  A 
sample letter follows.  
273  
These 30 were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not 
designated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed. 
274  
The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as 
far as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from 
[her], the Victim Specialist.”

198 
VNS data logs, correspondence maintained in the FBI’s case management system, and FBI 
interview reports for the Epstein investigation reflect that, during the Epstein investigation, the 
FBI generally issued its victim notification letters after the victim had been interviewed by FBI 
case agents, but its practice was not uniform.275
B.
August 2006:  The USAO’s Letters to Victims
During the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim 
notification letters, Villafaña was also preparing her own introductory letter in anticipation of 
meeting with each victim receiving the letter.  Villafaña told OPR that she was “generally aware 
that the FBI sends letters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my
process.”  Villafaña told OPR the “FBI had their own victim notification system and their own 
guidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”  
Moreover, Villafaña “didn’t know when [FBI] letters went out” or “what they said.”276
Nevertheless, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters she drafted to interfere with 
the FBI’s notification responsibilities.   
In August 2006, Villafaña drafted her letters to victims who had been initially identified 
by the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file.  Villafaña told OPR that she “made the decision 
to make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory letter and determined to 
whom they would be sent.  Although these letters contained CVRA rights information, Villafaña 
mainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims know the federal 
investigation “would be a different process” from the State Attorney’s Office investigation in 
which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.”  Villafaña told OPR that in a 
case in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate 
275  
OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an 
FBI letter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.  
Furthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI letter subsequent to her interview, and some 
FBI letters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents.  Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS 
data revealed some letters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file.  OPR 
could not confirm whether such letters were mailed or delivered.   
276  
Villafaña, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did 
not review the FBI notification letters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA 
litigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 30, 2008.    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 224 of 348

199 
questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.”  Villafaña directed 
the FBI case agents to hand deliver the letters “as they were conducting interviews.”  Villafaña 
told OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the 
filing of federal charges, and therefore Villafaña did not use a template or VNS-generated letter 
for content, but instead used a letter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”277   
The letters contained contact information for Villafaña, the FBI case agent, and the 
Department’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.  
The USAO letters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be 
notified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.”  The letters stated that, in 
addition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and 
potential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a 
list of counseling and medical services.278  Lastly, the letters advised that investigators for the 
defense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact 
Villafaña or the FBI case agent.   
Although the USAO letters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-
arrest or indictment stage, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters to activate the 
USAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed attached only after the filing of a criminal charge.  
Villafaña told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI letter and 
a USAO letter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO letter “was coming 
with an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].”  Later, in the course of 
the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of 
providing more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even 
before the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging 
decisions had been made.”279       
Villafaña informed Lourie and Sloman about the letters, but the letters were not reviewed 
by any of Villafaña’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management 
task.  Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified, 
because I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.”  Similarly, Menchel told 
OPR,    
277  
Villafaña told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she showed the letter to the USAO’s Victim Witness 
Specialist who “said it was fine.”  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not 
file a charging document in the Epstein matter, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not 
assume responsibility for victim contact.  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s 
victims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data 
concerning the Epstein investigation.  OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the 
USAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2008. 
278  
Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime 
supports programs and services to help victims of crime. 
279  
Villafaña informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions 
of individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide 
a higher standard of contact.”

[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider 
it to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim 
notifications occurred in every matter investigated or brought by the 
Office.  I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-
witness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that 
appropriate victim notifications occurred in every matter 
investigated or brought by the Office.  
C. 
USAO and FBI Letters Are Hand Delivered  
The FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met 
[with] the girls.”  The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO letters and FBI letters 
to some victims following in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a 
victim with a letter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to 
that set forth in the FBI letters.280  The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a 
few” letters to victims.  The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI letters to 
victims and she provided some FBI letters to the case agent for hand delivery. 
Nevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every 
right” with the victims.  She stated, however, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI 
Victim Specialist] giving the letter, me giving a letter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew 
that they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that 
they could call for that.”  The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected 
the FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and 
resources.”   
VI. 
AUGUST 2006 – SEPTEMBER 2007:  FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH 
VICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED 
Early in the investigation, Villafaña informed her supervisors that, up to that point, 
“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story.  Getting 
them to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.”  Between August 2006 and 
September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims.  On 
a few occasions, Villafaña met with victims together with the FBI.   Villafaña’s May 1, 2007 draft 
indictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafaña described the 
circumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.  
There is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to 
the FBI case agents and Villafaña concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and 
those discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome 
of the investigation.  Before the USAO entered into the NPA, however, no one from the 
280  
The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving letters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the 
conclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact 
information for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”

government informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through 
a state plea.   
A. 
The Case Agents and Villafaña Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about 
Resolving the Federal Investigation  
Villafaña told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask 
them how they wanted the case to be resolved.”281 
And most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea.  Some 
of them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all.  Most of them did 
not want to have to come to court and testify.  They were very 
worried about their privacy rights.  Some of them wanted him to go 
to jail.  But . . . [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with 
the State Attorney’s Office.  And so, I felt like sending them back to 
the State Attorney’s Office was not something that they would have 
supported.    
Villafaña told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about 
their safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the 
investigation.  In her 2017 declaration submitted in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that the 
two CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my 
role was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and 
allow the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”282  She also noted that some 
victims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would 
have on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”   
In the FBI case agent’s 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During 
interviews conducted from 2006 to 2008, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be 
prosecuted.”  She further described the concerns of some of the victims:   
Throughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] 
victims . . . .  A majority of the victims expressed concern about the 
possible disclosure of their identities to the public.  A number of the 
victims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents 
finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.  Additionally, 
281  
Villafaña created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with 
notations indicating several with whom Villafaña recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case.  The 
chart, however, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafaña told OPR that the information contained in the 
chart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim.  OPR was unable to determine the details or 
extent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2007, because Villafaña did not have contemporaneous 
notes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information 
about the victims’ desired outcomes.  The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential 
resolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.      
282  
In the declaration, Villafaña stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein 
prosecuted.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 227 of 348

202 
for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible 
exposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.  Overall, 
many of the victims were troubled about the existence of the 
investigation.  They displayed feelings of embarrassment and 
humiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators.  Some 
victims who were identified through the investigation refused even 
to speak to us.  Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and 
getting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of 
the investigation. 
The case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and 
“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.  
Rather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to know,” and “wanted to forget.”283   
As of September 24, 2007, the date the NPA was signed, Villafaña informed Epstein 
attorney Lefkowitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed 
minors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.284  
Although the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafaña 
acknowledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding 
the agreement.”  
B. 
Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaña Expresses Concern That Victims Have 
Not Been Consulted 
Before the NPA was signed, Villafaña articulated to her supervisors concerns about the 
government’s failure to consult with victims.  
1. 
July 2007:  Villafaña’s Email Exchanges with Menchel 
In July 2007, Villafaña learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez 
a possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein.  Villafaña was upset by this 
information, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns.  (A full account 
of their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.)  In that email, she 
told him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you know is completely 
unacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me.  These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the 
283  
The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her 
April 2007 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”     
284  
The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the 
government was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255.”    
Although the charges Villafaña proposed on May 1, 2007, were based on crimes against 13 victims, thereafter, as 
explained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims 
as the federal investigation developed further evidence.  At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were 
based on crimes against 19 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 228 of 348

203 
various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”285  Villafaña explained to OPR her reference 
to the victims:   
[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which 
requires the attorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to 
confer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents 
to keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case.  So 
in essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to 
allegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these 
plea negotiations without letting us know about it.286  
In his reply to Villafaña’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally 
inappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that 
“[a]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Attorney to exercise 
appropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with” 
Departmental policy.  Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafaña 
responded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgotten voices of victims in this case should not be 
classified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”   
Menchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer, 
asserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary settlement 
negotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.  
Menchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion 
that even just having a general discussion is something that must be vetted with victims . . . is not 
even . . . in the same universe as to how I think about this.”  Menchel also observed that on the 
very day that Villafaña criticized him for engaging in settlement negotiations without consulting 
her, the FBI, or the victims, Villafaña had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the 
possibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state 
resolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.287   
285  
Villafaña told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”  
Villafaña stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the 
victim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the 
victims” but did not likely contain information as to “how they would like the case resolved.”  Villafaña asserted that 
Menchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.”  Menchel told OPR that 
the allegations in Villafaña’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line 
in terms of what the law is and the policies are.”   
286  
As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were 
filed against a defendant.   
287  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafaña’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended 
only to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.

2. 
Villafaña Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to 
Consult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do 
Not Currently Recall Such Instructions 
Villafaña told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel, 
which took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the 
government’s obligation to confer with victims.288  Initially, Villafaña told OPR she was 
instructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims].  Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told 
why she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction.  In 
a subsequent OPR interview, Villafaña recalled that when she raised the issue of notification 
during the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.  You can’t disclose them.”289  
Villafaña remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.   
Neither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafaña was directed 
not to notify the victims.  Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view 
“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused 
on at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the 
NPA was signed.”  Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim 
notification was discussed.  Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any 
discussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter 
into a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein matter.”  Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not 
think of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO, 
because “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would 
have been “premature” to consider notification.290   
3. 
September 6, 2007:  Villafaña Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta, 
of Oosterbaan’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was 
Required  
On September 6, 2007, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the 
government’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafaña raised the victim consultation issue, 
advising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as 
[CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD] 
288  
Villafaña could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2007.   
289  
Villafaña also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause 
victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”   
290 
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafaña’s claim 
about a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and 
inconsistent with other evidence.  OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to 
which Menchel’s attorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafaña’s assertion that she had received an instruction from 
a supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations.  However, it is also true that OPR did not find any 
reference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim 
consultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims.  This is one of several events 
about which Menchel and Villafaña disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require 
prosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the 
alleged meeting and instruction.      
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 230 of 348

205 
Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”291  Sloman forwarded this 
email to Acosta.  Villafaña recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly 
after he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that now.”  Villafaña did not recall 
Sloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction. 
Villafaña told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve 
been advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.”  Sloman did not 
recall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with 
them regarding the potential resolution of the case.  Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that 
we had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek 
approval from victims to resolve a case.  We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution 
in . . . filed cases.”  Sloman said that no one other than Villafaña raised the notification issue, and 
because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the matter, Sloman “did not think that we 
had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.”  Lourie told OPR that he had no 
memory of Villafaña being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.292  Similarly, the 
attorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the 
Department told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he 
“assumed that was being handled.”293     
Acosta did not recall the September 6, 2007 email, but told OPR that “there is no 
requirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state 
prosecution.”  Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding 
victim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the 
victims before entering into the NPA.294  Ultimately, Acosta acknowledged to OPR, “[C]learly, 
given the way it’s played out, it may have been much better if we had [consulted with the victims].” 
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the 
CVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was 
not “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate 
291  
Villafaña told OPR that she referred to Oosterbaan in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and 
because I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].”  As previously noted, Villafaña’s 
statement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect.  Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires 
consultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement.  Moreover, Villafaña’s comments concerning the 
pre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement 
to OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate 
the USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent letters to victims in August 2006.   
292  
Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the 
office, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knowledge” of the case.   
293  
The AUSA who for a time served as Villafaña’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not 
“know anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the 
case.  The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do 
with the [NPA] negotiations.”   
294  
Villafaña told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order 
to . . . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 231 of 348

disagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.295  Oosterbaan’s disagreement was based on 
policy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a 
position that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].”  Oosterbaan also told OPR that whether or 
not the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,” 
but he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:   
The people I know, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying 
to do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically.  I just 
disagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying 
. . . to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . . 
you can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on 
this and maybe it doesn’t sway you.  You still do what you’re going 
to do but . . . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean 
exercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t 
really know what [the victims] would say.   
Sloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point 
in terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into 
and [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the 
victims.”    
VII. 
SEPTEMBER 24, 2007 – JUNE 30, 2008:  AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE 
USAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS 
The contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the 
case agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.  
However, the emails also show that the USAO was unclear about how much information could be 
given to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s 
defense counsel regarding victim notifications.296  As a result, although the expectation in the 
USAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision, 
and the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense attorneys, 
who strongly objected to the government’s notification plan.  In addition, Villafaña and the case 
agents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision 
would damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial.  In 
the end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Attorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims 
about the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not 
provided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2008.    
295  
Oosterbaan stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with how . . . I dealt with 
[the USAO].”   
296  
The NPA nondisclosure provision stated:  “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part 
of any public record.  If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process 
commanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”

A. 
September – October 2007:  The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the 
NPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential 
Impeachment  
In transmitting the signed NPA to Villafaña on September 24, 2007, defense attorney 
Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming 
public.”297  Villafaña forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach 
manager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.”  Acosta 
responded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required 
by law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media 
about the NPA, “this is the State Attorney[’]s show.”298  Acosta added, “In other words, what more 
does he want?”  Villafaña responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief 
or FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.”  Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is 
no reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy.  The [PBPD] Chief was 
only concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”299  Acosta responded that he would set up a 
call on September 26, 2007, to talk “about who we can tell and how much.”300   
Also on September 24, 2007, Villafaña emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to 
inform him that once the attorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to 
“meet with the girls myself to explain how the system [for obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. § 2255] 
will work.”  Villafaña also emailed Lefkowitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what 
I can tell [the attorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured 
Lefkowitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.”  Villafaña 
also provided Lefkowitz with a list of potential candidates for the attorney representative position 
and advocated for an attorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the matter. 
On September 26, 2007, Villafaña emailed Lefkowitz to request guidance on informing the 
victims about the NPA:  “Can you give me a call . . . I am meeting with the agents and want to 
give them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.”  Villafaña told OPR that 
because the government and the defense had not agreed on the attorney representative for the 
victims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to 
coordinate how to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would 
be an attorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.  Villafaña told OPR 
that the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be 
297  
Villafaña had assured Lefkowitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would 
remain part of our case file.  It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would 
distribute without compulsory process.”   
298  
Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have 
to “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOIA’d.”   
299  
Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefitted the victims were there for the victims 
to take advantage of. . . . and they did.  How . . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going 
to receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”   
300  
OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.

involved in such notifications.  According to Villafaña, Sloman then directed her to have the case 
agents make the victim notifications. 
Accordingly, Villafaña directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them 
with information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”  
The case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as  
to . . . how we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but 
it was the terms of the agreement.”  Villafaña believed that if “victims were properly notified of 
the terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein], 
and he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.”  Villafaña 
“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court 
change of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first 
victims were notified [by the FBI].”  Villafaña told OPR that it was her belief that because the 
USAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the 
general public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what 
the agreement was about.”  Villafaña told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a 
concern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.       
Within a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had 
reached a deal to resolve the Epstein case.  For example, on October 1, 2007, the  
New York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes 
at his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months,” and noted that 
Epstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into 
possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”301     
The case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and 
“we would not be pursuing this federally.”  In October 2007, for example, the case agents met with 
victim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”  
According to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had 
been reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be 
a federal prosecution.”302  However, in a declaration filed in 2015 in the CVRA litigation, Wild 
described the conversation differently: 
[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State 
court and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other 
victims. I knew that State charges had nothing to do with me.

The co-case agent recalled meeting with the victims about the resolution of the case, but could not recall the 
specifics of the discussions.

209 
During this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement 
had already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein 
for federal charges against me.  I did not get the opportunity to meet 
or confer with the prosecuting attorneys about any potential federal 
deal that related to me or the crimes committed against me. 
My understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal 
investigation would continue.  I also understood that my own case 
would move forward towards prosecution of Epstein. 
In addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to 
Villafaña in an email: 
Jane Doe #14 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic] 
jail sentence and Jane Doe #13 has asked for our Victim Witness 
coordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much 
needed [p]rofessional counseling.  Other than that, their response 
was filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for 
pursuing justice and not giving up.303     
The case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and 
expressed “a sense of relief.”  Counsel for “Jane Doe #13” told OPR that while his client recalled 
meeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about 
Epstein’s guilty plea.  In a letter to OPR, “Jane Doe #14’s” attorney stated that although her client 
recalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein 
would not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.   
After meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if 
Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’ 
knowledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.304  The 
case agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the 
damages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial . . . [if] 
Mr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these 
girls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think 
it was right.” 
Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafaña] 
and said we’re not comfortable now putting this out there . . . because . . . it’s likely that [the case 
agent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”  
Villafaña told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe 
303  
The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an 
interview of them, it was a notification. . . . [I]f there was something . . . relevant [that] came up pertaining to the 
investigation, or something that I thought was noteworthy . . . I might have [recorded it in an interview report].”   
304  
Within limitations set by the Federal Rules of Evidence, a defendant may attack the credibility of a witness 
through evidence of bias, which may include the witness having received money, or expecting to receive money, from 
the government, the defendant, or other sources as a result of the witness’s allegations or testimony.

for [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafaña or the case 
agents removed from the case.   
Both the lead case agent and Villafaña told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafaña 
the concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of 
a breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for 
advice.  Villafaña recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional 
Responsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if 
you’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”305  In her 2017 CVRA 
declaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped 
notifying victims about the NPA.   
B. 
October 2007:  Defense Attorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications  
While the case agents and Villafaña considered the impact that notifying the victims about 
the resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns 
about what the victims could be told about the NPA.  As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA 
was signed on September 24, 2007, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the 
attorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.  
On October 5, 2007, when defense attorney Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a letter responding to the 
USAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone 
from your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the 
case” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and 
would prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified 
individuals at this most critical stage.”  Lefkowitz followed this communication with an October 
10, 2007 letter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should 
contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”306  Rather, 
Lefkowitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified 
individuals.” 
On October 23, 2007, Villafaña raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating: 
We also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome 
of the case and to advise them that an attorney will be contacting 
them regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein.  If we don’t do 
that, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected 
attorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.   
As discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2007, Lefkowitz sent Acosta 
a letter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 20, 2007, 
305  
The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about 
victim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein matter before the CVRA litigation was instituted 
in July 2008 and he was assigned to handle the litigation.  Villafaña told OPR that they consulted the Professional 
Responsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional 
Responsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”   
306  
Lefkowitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 236 of 348

211 
and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October 12, 2007, not to “contact any of the identified 
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this 
matter.”307  Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Acosta 
revised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkowitz, in particular noting that 
Acosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact.  The draft response, as revised 
by Acosta, stated:   
You 
should 
understand, 
however, 
that 
there 
are 
some 
communications that are typical in these matters.  As an example, 
our Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them 
that either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing] 
them.  Rest assured that we will continue to treat this matter as we 
would any similarly situated case.308 
In a November 5, 2007 letter, Sloman complained to Lefkowitz that private investigators 
working for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had 
discussed financial settlement with them.  Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are 
troublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of 
the matter, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed 
to pay damages in some circumstances.”  The same day, Villafaña emailed Sloman expressing her 
concern that “if we [file charges] now, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told 
you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”309   
C. 
October – November 2007:  The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate, 
and the FBI Sends a Notice Letter to One Victim Stating That the Case is 
“Under Investigation” 
Although Villafaña and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the 
NPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing 
potential victims.  In October and November 2007, the FBI interviewed 12 potential new victims, 
of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the 
307  
Villafaña later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general 
discussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”    
308  
Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO 
would not accept a “gag order.”  OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find 
any evidence that the draft letter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.  
309  
Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that 
such concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty.  In August 
2008, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafaña, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding 
that the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA] . . . because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA] 
applied.”  Acosta responded:  “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as 
potential witnesses.  Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to 
discuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”

212 
NPA.310  The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the 
victims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case.  Villafaña acknowledged 
that she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the 
agreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and 
that we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”  
On October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice letter to a victim 
the case agents had interviewed two days earlier.  This letter was identical to the VNS form notice 
letter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the 
case as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.”  The letter listed the eight 
CVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision.  Villafaña told OPR she 
was unaware the FBI sent the letter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had 
identified all victims of the crimes under investigation.”  In response to OPR’s questions about the 
accuracy of the FBI letter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafaña told 
OPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2008, and “at this point we 
weren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically 
suspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.” 
D. 
The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Letter 
about Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal 
Investigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan 
In anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafaña reported on November 16, 2007, to 
Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with 
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, that the State Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify 
victims of the state plea hearing. 
[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.  The 
State does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the 
Court has to provide a separate room for victims who want to attend 
judicial proceedings, so I do not know how many victims will 
actually want to be present.311 
Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any 
coordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s 
state plea hearing. 
On November 19, 2007, Villafaña decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from 
the defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in 
writing.”  She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification letter, in which among other things, 
310  
Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list.  For example, one would not 
cooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third 
claimed she had no contact with Epstein.   
311  
Villafaña told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or 
two victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 238 of 348
SA-238
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page240 of 258

213 
she would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s 
agreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve 18 months in county jail, and the victims’ 
ability to seek monetary damages against Epstein.  The letter also would invite victims to appear 
at the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a written statement to be 
filed by the State Attorney’s Office.  Sloman and Villafaña exchanged edits on the draft victim 
notification letter, and Villafaña also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t 
receive the original letters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the letter for 
those.”312   
Sloman informed Lefkowitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation 
(Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their 
rights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by letter after COB 
Thursday, November 29.”  Lefkowitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that 
it was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2004.  He 
argued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission 
prior to it being sent to any alleged victims.”  He also insisted that if any notification letters were 
sent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein 
has entered his plea” and that the letter should come from the attorney representative rather than 
the government.  On November 28, 2007, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña provided Lefkowitz 
with the draft victim notification letter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was 
to occur on December 14, 2007.313  
In a November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz strongly objected to the proposed draft 
notification letter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any letter to victims until 
after Epstein’s plea and sentencing.  Lefkowitz also contended that the victims had no right to 
appear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a written statement for such a 
proceeding.  In a November 30, 2007 reply letter to Lefkowitz, Acosta did not address the 
substance of Lefkowitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting 
collateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was 
dissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial.  Shortly 
thereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by letter that he had directed prosecutors “not to 
issue victim notification letters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time 
to review these options with your client.”  In the letter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that 
Villafaña had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary 
damages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during 
the investigation phase of this matter.” 
On December 5, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz sent a letter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman 
and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with 
312  
On November 28, 2007, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafaña that 
only 15 of the then-known victims had received victim notification letters from either the FBI or the USAO.  On 
December 6, 2007, the lead case agent reported to Villafaña that she was “still holding many of the original V/W 
letters addressed to victims from the USAO.”     
313  
Villafaña understood the state prosecutors had set the December 14, 2007 date, and emailed them for 
confirmation, stating, “[I]f the matter is set for the 14th, please let me know so I can include that in my victim 
notifications.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 239 of 348

214 
the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.”  The Starr and 
Lefkowitz letter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim 
notification letter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the 
notification letter until after the defense was able “to discuss this matter with Assistant Attorney 
General Fisher.”  
The following day, Sloman sent a letter to Lefkowitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafaña, 
asserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
proceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled.  Sloman also stated that the VRRA 
obligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which 
they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing 
of charges, and the acceptance of a plea.314  (Emphasis in original).  Sloman added: 
Just as in 18 U.S.C. § 3771 [the CVRA], these sections are not 
limited to proceedings in a federal district court.  Our Non-
Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by 
allowing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.  The victims 
identified through the federal investigation should be appropriately 
informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.315 
Sloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafaña or the 
FBI case agent with questions or concerns:  “Again, federal law requires that victims have the 
‘reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in this case.’”  Sloman advised 
the defense:  “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed 
to Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation.  Those questions are appropriately directed to 
law enforcement.” 
Along with this letter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkowitz for comment a revised draft victim 
notification letter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense.  The 
letter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would 
plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend 18 months of imprisonment at sentencing, 
and Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The 
letter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing: 
As I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal 
investigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.  
Mr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on 
December 14, 2007, at ___ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley, 
314  
See 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(1)(B) and (c)(3). 
315  
Emphasis in original.  Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is 
simply informing the victims of their rights.”  Villafaña informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the letter, 
but she was the primary author of the document.  OPR notes that Villafaña was the principal author of most 
correspondence in the Epstein case, and that following the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the letter went 
out with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three attorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence 
before a final version was sent to the defense.

social, psychological, or physical harm, financial losses, loss 
of earnings directly or indirectly resulting from the crime for 
which the defendant is being sentenced, and any matter 
relevant to an appropriate disposition and sentence.  Fl[a]. 
Stat. [§] 921.143(2).    
Sloman told OPR that he was “proceeding under the belief that we were going to notify [the 
victims], even though it wasn’t a federal case.  Whether we were required or not.”  Sloman also 
told OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification 
letters . . . I think . . . Marie and . . . the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some 
level.” 
On December 7, 2007, Villafaña prepared letters containing the above information to be 
sent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.316  
Sloman, however, had that day received a letter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing 
was scheduled for January 4, 2008, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim 
notification letters until “we can further discuss the contents.”  Also that day, Starr and Lefkowitz 
submitted to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense 
arguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  Sloman 
responded to Villafaña’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the letter.”317  Sloman told 
OPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] letter out,” but his instruction to Villafaña 
was “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.  
Sloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO 
“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . . . and the deal fell apart, then 
the victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary 
compensation.” 
On December 10, 2007, Villafaña contacted the attorney who at the time represented the 
victim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing 
victim notification letters.”  In her 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña noted 
that she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered 
316  
The FBI case agent had emailed Villafaña the day before stating, “The letter that is currently being revised 
needs to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.”  The case agent also 
stated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this letter.  My 
primary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”    
317  
Villafaña told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the letters; rather, 
she “just remember[ed] putting them all in the Redweld and putting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”

her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she 
wanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”318 
E. 
December 19, 2007:  Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to 
the State Attorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea 
Hearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as 
Required by Law”  
On December 11, 2007, Starr transmitted to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by 
Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of 
the investigation” into Epstein.  Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmittal 
letter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims 
put illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not 
being served.”  By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately 
provided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl’s attorney, even though it 
was clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a 
victim.”   
In his submissions, Lefkowitz argued that the government was not required to notify 
victims of the § 2255 provision: 
Villafaña’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of 
a restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification 
requirement under the Justice for All Act of 2004, a federal law that 
requires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available 
restitution, not of any potential civil remedies.  Despite this fact, 
[she] proposed a Victims Notification letter to be sent to the alleged 
federal victims.   
Lefkowitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate 
mechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of 18 U.S.C. § 2255, 
and a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights.  Lefkowitz took issue with the 
government’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification letter to the 
alleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so.  Lefkowitz further argued 
that the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a 
public, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.     
In a letter from Villafaña to Lefkowitz, responding to his allegations that she had 
committed misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had 
318  
As noted previously, in April 2007, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable 
to Epstein.  Villafaña told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a 
victim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal 
charging document.  Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately 
furnished to the defense.  The attorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by 
Epstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.

informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their 
allegations against Mr. Epstein”: 
None of the victims were informed of the right to sue under 
Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.  Three victims 
were notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general 
terms of that Agreement.  You raised objections to any victim 
notification, and no further notifications were done.  Throughout 
this process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though 
it would proceed to trial.  Notifying the witnesses of the possibility 
of damages claims prior to concluding the matter by plea or trial 
would only undermine my case.  If my reassurances are insufficient 
the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein 
should assure you of the integrity of the investigation. 
On December 14, 2007, Villafaña forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification letter 
previously sent to the defense, along with two draft letters addressed to State Attorney Krischer; 
Villafaña’s transmittal email to Acosta had the subject line, “The letters you requested.”  One of 
the draft letters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafaña, was to advise that the USAO had sent an 
enclosed victim notification letter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list 
of the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them 
with any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”319  The second draft letter 
to Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s 
allegations that the State Attorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and 
sentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender 
registration.  OPR found no evidence that these letters were sent to Krischer.320   
A few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafaña 
emailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?”  Villafaña told 
Sloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA] 
are the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in 
an unrelated matter].  We seem to be in a Catch 22.”321  OPR did not find a response to Villafaña’s 
email.  
In their December 14, 2007 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their 
lengthy follow-up letter to Acosta on December 17, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz continued to press 
their objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein matter.  They requested that Acosta 
319  
The draft victim notification letter was identical to the draft victim notification letter sent to the defense on 
December 6, 2007, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2008.   
320  
Moreover, the letters were not included in the publicly released State Attorney’s file, which included other 
correspondence from the USAO.  See Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available 
at http://sa15.org/stateattorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm. 
321  
OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.  
Villafaña told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on” 
filing federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”

review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly 
expansive interpretation” of 18 U.S.C. § 2255.   
In a December 19, 2007 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two 
paragraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties 
intended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they 
would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.”  Acosta also advised 
that although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation, 
the USAO would leave to the State Attorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state 
proceedings:  
I understand that the defense objects to the victims being given 
notice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing 
hearing.  I have reviewed the proposed victim notification letter and 
the statute.  I would note that the United States provided the draft 
letter to the defense as a courtesy.  In addition, First Assistant United 
States Attorney Sloman already incorporated in the letter several 
edits that had been requested by defense counsel.  I agree that [the 
CVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations 
of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.  We intend to provide 
victims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law.  We 
will defer to the discretion of the State Attorney regarding whether 
he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings, 
although we will provide him with the information necessary to do 
so if he wishes.   
Acosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this letter without running it by [Sloman], if 
not other individuals in the office,” and records show he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafaña.  
Acosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of 
whether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the 
role of the USAO, “to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state 
outcome.”322  Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the 
State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to 
question that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not  
assume . . . that the State Attorney’s Office is full of bad actors.”  Acosta told OPR that it was his 
understanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have 
an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”  Acosta also told OPR that the state would 
322  
Sloman’s handwritten notes from a December 21, 2007 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the 
defense, “Are there concerns re: 3771 lang[uage],” to which Lefkowitz replied, “The state should have their own 
mechanism.”  At the time of the Epstein matter, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded 
the “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.  Fla. 
Const. art. I, § 16(b)(6).  Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims 
are given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the 
victim[.]”  Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(a) (2007).  Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or written impact statement.  
Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(k) (2007).  Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family 
of the victim must be consulted by the state attorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the 
disposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.  Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(g) (2007).

219 
have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence 
would also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”   
Sloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state 
court proceedings should be “left to the state.”323  Mandelker, however, had no memory of advising 
Acosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Attorney, and she noted that the 
“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision 
“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that 
I did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.”  Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that 
“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights 
under § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were 
going to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide how the victims were going 
to be notified.”   
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim 
list from the USAO.  She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard 
to contacting the victims. 
In response to Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter, Lefkowitz asserted that the FBI should 
not communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be 
heard at the sentencing hearing:  
[Y]our letter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s 
proposed victims notification letter was that the women identified 
as victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state 
proceedings.  That is not true, as our previous letter clearly states.  
Putting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom 
[CVRA] notification letters are intended are in fact not victims as 
defined in the Attorney General’s 2000 Victim Witness 
Guidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary 
injury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these 
women may be notified of such proceedings but since they are 
neither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this matter, 
they should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make 
sworn written or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein 
at such proceedings, as Ms. Villafaña repeatedly maintained they 
had the right to do.  Additionally, it was and remains our position 
that any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts 
by the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the 
execution of the Agreement should finally come to an end.  We 
agree, however, with your December 19 modification of the 
previously drafted federal notification letter and agree that the 
323  
In his June 3, 2008 letter to Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted 
with DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the following proposal [to defer notification to the State Attorney’s 
Office].”  OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.

220 
decision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst 
many other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision 
making.324 
Following a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, in which Acosta asked that the 
defense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications 
to the victims, Lefkowitz responded with a December 26, 2007 letter to Acosta, objecting again to 
notification of the victims.  Lefkowitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because 
the Attorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an 
offense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.  
Nevertheless, Lefkowitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not 
object (as we made clear in our letter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged 
victims.”  Lefkowitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice 
sent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses 
should be sent by the State Attorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO 
“should defer to the discretion of the State Attorney regarding all matters with regard to those 
victims and the state proceedings.”   
Months later, in April 2008, Epstein’s attorneys complained in a letter to Mandelker that 
Sloman and Villafaña committed professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly 
improper and unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” victims.  
F. 
January – June 2008:  While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department 
in an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating 
Epstein 
As described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through 
the end of June 2008, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely, 
implementation of the NPA.  Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s 
decision to have the federal case reviewed afresh.  A review of the evidence was undertaken first 
by USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial 
attorney.  A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS 
Chief Oosterbaan, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal 
Mandelker and Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy 
Attorney General.  Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.   
As set forth below, during that time, Villafaña and the FBI continued investigating and 
working toward potential federal charges.  
1. 
Villafaña Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein 
Will Breach the NPA  
On January 3, 2008, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state 
court, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2008, at which time he 
would plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea, 
324  
The 2000 Guidelines were superseded by the 2005 Guidelines.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 246 of 348
SA-246
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page248 of 258

221 
“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal 
laws.”325   
Nevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that 
there was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and 
with his attorneys asserting that “the facts had gotten better for Epstein,” Villafaña came to believe 
that Epstein would likely breach the NPA.326  In January 2008, Villafaña informed her supervisors 
that the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared 
to [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with 
the vast majority of the victims.”  Villafaña then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with 
all the victims so that we know we can rely on them at trial.”327  Villafaña told OPR that at this 
point, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or 
send any victim notification letters—there simply was nothing to update.  I did not receive any 
victim calls during this time.” 
2. 
The FBI Uses VNS Form Letters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims 
On January 10, 2008, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification 
letters to 14 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their 
contact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the matter.328  The 
case agent informed Villafaña in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI] 
letter to all the remaining identified victims.”  These 2008 letters were identical to the FBI form 
letters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2006, and October 12, 2007.  
Like those previous letters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24, 
2007, the 2008 letters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his 
can be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough 
investigation.”  The letters also stated: 
325  
Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny 
Sheet,” Jan. 3, 2008.  
326  
Epstein’s attorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned 
unflattering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the 
exclusion of those victims from the federal case.  For example, defense attorneys questioned one victim as to whether 
the federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.  See Exhibit 9 to 
Villafaña June 2, 2017 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2006-CF-9454, at 44, 
50, 51 (Feb. 20, 2008).  One victim’s attorney told OPR that the defense attorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking 
highly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”  
Epstein’s attorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client.  For example, 
the Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and 
knew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.”  See Julie Brown, “Perversion of Justice: Cops 
Worked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.  Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 
2018.  
327  
Villafaña also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.  
328  
The Victim Specialist later generated an additional letter dated May 30, 2008.  After Epstein’s June 30, 2008 
state court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification letters to two victims who resided outside of the United 
States.

222 
We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights 
described.  Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the 
arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become 
the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office 
to ensure you are accorded those rights.  You may also seek the 
advice of a private attorney with respect to these rights.   
The FBI case agent informed Villafaña that the Victim Specialist sent the letters and would follow 
up with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their letter.”   
A sample letter is shown on the following pages.   
Villafaña told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the letters at the time 
they were sent to the victims, or reviewing the letters until they were collected for the CVRA 
litigation, sometime after July 2008.  Rather, according to Villafaña, “The decision to issue the 
letter and the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.”  Nevertheless, Villafaña 
asserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was 
absolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in 
my supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.”  Villafaña identified 
various investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2007 until the end of June 
2008,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing 
victims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental 
prosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges.  Similarly, 
the FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and 
the investigation was continuing.”  The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s 
never been shut down.” 
Victim Courtney Wild received one of the January 10, 2008 FBI letters; much later, in the 
course of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this letter was that [her] case 
was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal 
prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”329 
329  
CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January 10, 2008 FBI letter that was sent to her counsel.

Villafaña, the FBI, and the CEOS Trial Attorney Interview Victims
As Villafaña resumed organizing the case for charging and trial, the FBI case agent 
provided Villafaña with a list of “the 19 identified victims we are planning on using in” the federal
charges and noted that she and her co-case agent wanted to further evaluate some additional 
victims.330  In Washington, D.C., CEOS assigned a Trial Attorney to the Epstein case in order to 
bring expertise and “a national perspective” to the matter.331     
On January 18, 2008, one attorney representing a victim and her family contacted Sloman 
by telephone, stating that he planned to file civil litigation against Epstein on behalf of his clients, 
who were “frustrated with the lack of progress in the state’s investigation” of Epstein.  The attorney
asked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the 
matter,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.332  In late 
January, the New York Post reported that the attorney’s clients had filed a $50 million civil suit 
against Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to 18 months in prison 
when he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”333   
Between January 31, 2008, and May 28, 2008, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed 
additional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was 
signed.334  In late January 2008, as Villafaña and the CEOS Trial Attorney prepared to participate 
330  
The case agent also informed Villafaña that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain 
additional information. 
331  
The CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare 
for the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”   
332  
Because Sloman and the attorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to 
Acosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.   OPR reviewed the matter as an inquiry and 
determined that no further action was warranted.

225 
in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafaña informed CEOS Chief Oosterbaan that she 
anticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”   
On January 31, 2008, Villafaña, the CEOS Trial Attorney, and the FBI interviewed three 
victims, including Wild.  Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January 10, 2008 
letter stating that the case was under investigation; however, according to the case agent, Wild and 
two other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2007, that the case had been resolved.  
In her 2015 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI letter, she believed 
that the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential 
resolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in.  If I had been told of a[n 
NPA], I would have objected.”  In Villafaña’s 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña 
recalled interviewing Wild on January 31, 2008, along with FBI agents, and Villafaña told OPR 
she “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.”  Villafaña recalled 
Wild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to 
testify.”335   
After the first three victim interviews on January 31, 2008, Villafaña described for Acosta 
and Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims: 
One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview 
twice . . . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming 
after her and she started to break down again so we stopped the 
interview. 
The second girl . . . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had 
read about in the paper.336  She said that 18 months was nothing and 
that she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would 
rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time 
in jail.337      
Villafaña closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman attend the interviews with victims 
scheduled for the following day, but neither did so.338  Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical” 
335  
The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.   
336  
See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at 14 - $50M Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New 
York Post, Jan. 25, 2008.  As early as October 2007, the New York Post reported the 18-month sentence and that 
“[t]he feds have agreed to drop their probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to 
the new state charge.”  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal – Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” 
New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007. 
337  
Acosta told OPR, “The United States can’t unwind an agreement just because . . . some victim indicates that 
they don’t like it.”  The CEOS Trial Attorney recalled that she did not “think that any one of these girls was interested 
in this prosecution going forward.”  Furthermore, as previously noted, the CEOS Trial Attorney also opined that “[the 
victims] would have testified for us,” but the case would have required an extensive amount of “victim management,” 
as the girls were “deeply embarrassed” that they “were going to be called prostitutes.”     
338  
OPR located FBI interview reports relating to only one February 1, 2008 victim interview.  Although 
Villafaña’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, OPR 
located no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.  OPR located undated handwritten notes Villafaña

226 
for him, as U.S. Attorney, to attend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was 
questioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.”  Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never 
gone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”    
Villafaña told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had 
been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafaña 
did not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had 
these terms.”  Villafaña also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want 
there to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their 
claims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.”  Rather, 
according to Villafaña, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where 
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually 
perform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”  
Villafaña recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing 
the case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.”  Villafaña 
recalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it 
so low” and Villafaña answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”339   
With regard to the victims Villafaña interviewed who had not received an FBI notification 
in October 2007, Villafaña recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they 
discussed the agreement.  She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an 
agreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “pretty sure” that she did not mention the 
agreement during the interview of the third victim.  Villafaña explained that she likely did not 
discuss the agreement because  
at that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent.  [The victim] didn’t 
know anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was 
going to end up being thrown on the heap, and I didn’t want to -- . . . 
if you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admitted that he’s guilty, 
like, I didn’t want that to color her statement.  I just wanted to get 
the facts of the case. 
The CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims 
about the NPA or the status of the case.340  She did remember explaining the significance of the 
prosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein.  The FBI case 
agent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2008 interviews.  OPR located notes to an FBI 
interview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted.  Attorneys 
for the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the 
resolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2020, their clients had no memory of meeting with 
authored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the 
investigation or the resolution of the case.  Through her attorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having 
contact with anyone from the USAO.       
339  
Villafaña did not recall any other specific questions from victims.  
340  
The CEOS Trial Attorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were 
generally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.

prosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the 
plea was entered on June 30, 2008.   
When asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims, 
Villafaña told OPR: 
From my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it 
was an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment.  You 
know, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal 
process], . . .  I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a 
federal indictment and a federal trial.  So to me, saying to a victim 
the case is now back under investigation is perfectly accurate. 
4. 
February – March 2008:  Villafaña Takes Additional Steps to Prepare 
for a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Attorneys for 
Victims, and Cautions about Continued Delay 
In February 2008, Villafaña revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental 
memorandum.  Villafaña removed some victims known to Epstein from the PBPD investigation 
and others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly 
discovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.   
While the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of 
the Department, Villafaña sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and 
attempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some 
victims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.  
Villafaña reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service 
organization” to provide attorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some 
victims to provide contact information for the attorneys.341  During this period, an attorney from 
the victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.  
Villafaña also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit 
suicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case:  “I just can’t stress 
enough how important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.  The ‘please be patient’ 
answer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the attack while we are 
forced to wait on the sidelines.” 
5. 
March – April 2008:  Villafaña Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal 
Charges 
Villafaña continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing 
others who had filed civil suits against Epstein.  Villafaña also prepared search warrants for digital 
341  
The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafaña that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them 
of the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime 
are afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”

camera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted 
images that could contain child pornography.342   
By early April 2008, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal 
Division, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafaña and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein 
were “more and more likely.”  Villafaña asked Oosterbaan for help to “move this [Criminal 
Division review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s 
case by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents 
and the victims” were “losing their patience.”   
On April 24, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior 
asking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had 
expressed to Oosterbaan.  Villafaña further cautioned that, although she was planning to file 
charges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the 
agents, and the police officers to decide how the case will be resolved and to provide them with an 
explanation for the delay.”  Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its 
review of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, however, Villafaña did not file charges that day.  
VIII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED 
MATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION 
During the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA 
by entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict 
between the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights attached upon the filing of a 
criminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary.  The contemporaneous 
communications confirm that in 2008, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy 
regarding the issue.   
Unrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April 18, 2008, Acosta and Sloman received a 
citizen complaint from an attorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the 
Florida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights.  The attorney asserted that the CVRA 
guaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was 
the victim of a federal crime.  Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division 
Chief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2005 Guidelines, “our obligations 
under [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.”  On April 24, 2008, the Appellate 
Division Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her] 
reading of [the 2005 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not 
triggered until a case is filed.”343   
On May 7, 2008, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s 
342  
The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.  
343  
The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the 
initiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations 
to the victim.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 254 of 348
SA-254
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page256 of 258

229 
CVRA rights attach prior to the filing of criminal charges.344  The Appellate Division Chief noted 
that, although the holding conflicted with the 2005 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.” 
Dean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2005 explosion at an oil refinery 
operated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed 15 people and injured more than 
170.  Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without 
notifying the victims.  The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the 
potential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such 
notification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations.  The court 
then entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea 
agreement until after it had been signed by the parties.  Thereafter, the government filed a criminal 
information, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices 
of the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard.  One month later, 12 
victims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights 
under the CVRA.  The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to 
confer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s 
dignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.345  The district court noted that the 
legislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as 
being a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.   
In denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court 
“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”346  In particular, the Fifth Circuit 
cited the district court’s acknowledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that 
apply before any prosecution is underway.”  The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation 
was not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is 
only a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before 
ultimately exercising its broad discretion.”  In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department 
components wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning 
whether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution. 
IX. 
JUNE 2008:  VILLAFAÑA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY 
REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA 
PETITIONERS 
According to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her attorney, Bradley Edwards, 
Wild retained Edwards in June 2008 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from 
the [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey 
Epstein.”347  Villafaña told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of 
344  
In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008).  The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida, 
which is within the Eleventh Circuit.  
345  
United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2008 WL 501321, at *11 (S.D. Tex. 2008).  Victims who 
wished to be heard were permitted to speak at the plea hearing.   
346  
Dean, 527 F.3d at 394. 
347  
Before Epstein’s state court plea hearing, Edwards also began representing the victim who became Jane Doe 
#2.  Although OPR focuses on Villafaña’s communications with Edwards in this section, OPR notes that Villafaña 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 255 of 348
SA-255
Case 22-1426, Document 77, 06/29/2023, 3536038, Page257 of 258

230 
an instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of 
the FBI case agents.  
Edwards contacted Villafaña by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had 
“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”348  In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that 
during multiple telephone calls with Villafaña, he “asked very specific questions about what stage 
the investigation was in,” and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because 
the matter “was an on-going active investigation[.]”  Edwards attested that Villafaña gave him “the 
impression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, 
both in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”349   
In her written response to OPR, Villafaña said that she “listened more than [she] spoke” 
during these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea: 
Given the uncertainty of the situation – Epstein was still challenging 
our ability to prosecute him federally, pressing allegations of 
prosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate better plea terms, 
while the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving towards 
[filing charges] – I did not feel comfortable sharing any information 
about the case.  It is also my practice not to talk about status before 
the grand jury.   
In her 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña explained that during these 
exchanges, Villafaña did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not 
know whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court 
guilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”350  Villafaña told OPR that she did not inform Edwards 
also had interactions with other victims’ attorneys.  For example, another attorney informed OPR that he spoke to 
Villafaña two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under 
investigation.  The attorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafaña].  We were never told what was 
happening or going on to any extent.”  Villafaña’s counsel told OPR that Villafaña did not have any interaction with 
the attorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her written communications 
responding to the attorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible.  OPR found no documentation 
that Villafaña’s communications with the attorney occurred prior to June 30, 2008.  Villafaña also had more ministerial 
interactions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases.  For example, in March 
2008, one victim’s attorney informed Villafaña of his representation of a victim and requested that the government 
provide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s 
airplane.  Villafaña responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep 
her updated about the civil litigation.    
348  
Villafaña later stated in a July 9, 2008 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited 
Edwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”  
349  
Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other 
attorneys who were representing victims.   
350  
The government later admitted in court filings that Villafaña and Edwards “discussed the possibility of 
federal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.”  Doe, Government’s Response to

about the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and 
leading towards” the filing of charges.  Villafaña recalled mentioning the conversation to her 
supervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance 
to us and . . . could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and 
should be prosecuted.”  
Nevertheless, when OPR asked Villafaña why she did not inform Edwards of the same 
information that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2007 and January 2008, 
Villafaña explained that she felt “prohibited”: 
At the time that I spoke with him, you know, there had been all of 
this . . . letter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I 
had been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose 
things further and not to have any involvement in victim 
notification, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him 
about the existence of the NPA. 
X. 
JUNE 2008:  EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 30, 2008 PLEA 
HEARING 
The Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2008, when the 
Deputy Attorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and 
Epstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such 
a decision.  Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña notified Lefkowitz that 
Epstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to 
begin his sentence of imprisonment.”  That same day, Villafaña made plans to file charges on July 
1, 2008, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 30 deadline. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, Villafaña received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement 
and learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on Monday, June 30, 2008.  Also on 
that Friday, Villafaña submitted to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final” 
proposed federal indictment of Epstein. 
Villafaña and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose, 
for § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña contacted 
PBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing.  Villafaña told OPR that 
Sloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the 
plea.”351  On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief 
Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”352  
351  
Villafaña further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the 
upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator, 
and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”        
352  
Sloman replied, “Good.”

232 
Villafaña told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims, 
including their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.  Villafaña recalled 
that Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy 
the list afterwards.  Villafaña did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the 
State Attorney’s Office.” 
In his 2009 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafaña sent him a letter “around the time of 
sentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the 
letter after he reviewed it.  Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the 
state grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had 
identified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our 
victims.”353 
In her 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she and the PBPD 
“attempted to notify the victims about [the June 30] hearing in the short time available to us.”354  
In her 2008 declaration, however, Villafaña conceded that “all known victims were not notified.”    
Villafaña told OPR that Edwards was the only victim attorney she was authorized to 
contact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 30, 2008 plea hearing because Edwards 
“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.”  Villafaña recalled, “I was told that I could 
inform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”355  In her 2008 
declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she called Edwards and informed him of 
the plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafaña stated that Edwards told her that he could not 
attend the hearing but “someone” would be present.  In a later filing in the CVRA litigation, 
however, Edwards asserted that Villafaña told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state 
solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of 
the federally-identified victims.”356  Edwards further claimed that because Villafaña failed to 
inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal 
prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not attend the hearing.  Villafaña told 
OPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allow Edwards and his clients 
the ability to comment on the resolution: 
353  
Reiter showed the letter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the 
state case were included on that.”  The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed 
it.”  The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter showed it to him.          
354  
The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”   
355  
Villafaña told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not 
“remember the specifics of the conversation.”  
356  
Villafaña stated that she “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and 
neither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a 
specific victim.”  Although Edwards criticized Villafaña’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published 
book, Edwards described Villafaña as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in 
the victims and tr[ied] . . .  to bring down Jeffrey Epstein.”  Bradley J. Edwards with Brittany Henderson, Relentless 
Pursuit at 380 (Gallery Books 2020).

233 
[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that 
it would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer 
that was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any 
victims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad 
Edwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to 
address the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.357 
Sloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafaña to contact anyone about the plea 
hearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it.  Acosta told OPR that he 
believed the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal 
case “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”  
Nevertheless, Acosta did not know whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims 
or whether the USAO “shared that list with them.”  Villafaña told OPR that she and Acosta 
“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that 
the state only believed they had one victim.”358  Villafaña told OPR that there was “very little” 
communication between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, and although she discussed a 
factual proffer with the State Attorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had 
identified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they 
considered victims in the state case.”359 
Sloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results 
of this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.  He explained: 
[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the 
victims were going to be notified and the state was going . . . to 
fulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims] 
would be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set 
up on their behalf.   
Sloman acknowledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO 
from exercising its discretion to notify the victims,  
it was [of] concern that this was going to break down and . . . result 
in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be 
witnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, 
you’re going to get $150,000, that’s . . . going to be instant 
impeachment for the defense.  
357  
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case 
would not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings.  Rather, such a 
presentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office and additional 
investigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Attorney’s Office.      
358  
In an email a few months earlier, Villafaña noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution] 
is related to two girls.  One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”    
359  
As noted in Chapter Two, Villafaña had stopped communicating with the State Attorney’s Office regarding 
the state case following Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 259 of 348
SA-259
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page5 of 217

234 
When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, 
Sloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.  I didn’t get the sense 
that the victims were overly interested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.”   
Also, in late June, Villafaña drafted a victim notification letter concerning the June 30, 
2008 plea.360  Villafaña told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2007 that we 
would not provide written notice of the state change of plea, the written victim notifications were 
prepared to be sent immediately following Epstein’s guilty plea.”361  As she did with prior draft 
victim notification letters, Villafaña provided the draft to the defense for comments.362   
Although Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 30, 2008, Villafaña took steps to facilitate 
the filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.  
OPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Attorney’s Office made 
available online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing 
date, the state informed victims of the June 30, 2008 plea.  On March 12, 2008, the State Attorney’s 
Office issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding 
the individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2008.  However, the Palm Beach 
County Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at] 
college.”       
XI. 
JUNE 30, 2008:  EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT 
HEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT 
On June 30, 2008, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his attorney 
Jack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under 18 
for prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution.  The 
information charged that between August 1, 2004, and October 9, 2005, Epstein “did knowingly 
and unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under 
the age of 18 years,” and referred to no other victims.  The indictment did not identify any victims 
and alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August 
1, 2004, and October 31, 2005.  Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to 
multiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed the court that 
“[t]here’s several” victims.  When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these 
cases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to 
several myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,  
360  
Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification letter to Acosta, who responded with his own edited version 
stating, “What do you think?”  Villafaña edited it further.     
361  
The letter began with the statement, “On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.”  A week 
after Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafaña notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local 
attorney] Jack Goldberger is back in town today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—
the victim list and Notification.  If I face resistance on that front, I will let you know.”    
362  
According to Villafaña, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications following the 
state plea and to share the draft notification letters with the defense.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 260 of 348
SA-260
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page6 of 217

235 
yes.”  The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the 
plea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age 18, Belohlavek spoke 
with the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.363   
Both Villafaña and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the 
plea hearing.  Later that day, Villafaña met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 31 individuals 
the government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.   
In her 2015 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to attend 
that hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation 
of Epstein’s abuse of me.”  She stated that she “would have attended and tried to object to the 
judge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she known that the state plea “had some 
connection to blocking the prosecution of my case.”  Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 
stated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”   
An attorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had 
subpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 30, 2008, in 
order to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of 
one of his clients.  The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.364  Moreover, the 
attorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in 
the PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s attorneys in the state case (with the 
Assistant State Attorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 30, 2008 plea 
hearing from the State Attorney’s Office.365  Similarly, another of the victims the state had 
subpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her attorney that she received subpoenas from the 
State Attorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing.  Belohlavek 
told OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing, 
and she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically” 
been victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses.  On July 24, 2008, the 
State Attorney’s Office sent letters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2008 
(although the plea occurred on June 30, 2008) and listed Epstein’s sentence.  The letters did not 
mention the NPA or the federal investigation. 
XII. 
SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS 
A. 
Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaña Notifies Some 
Victims’ Attorneys 
Villafaña’s contemporaneous notes show that immediately after Epstein’s June 30, 2008 
guilty pleas, she attempted to reach by telephone five attorneys representing various victims in 
363  
Villafaña, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no 
information as to whether or how the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.    
364  
Villafaña did contact this attorney’s law partner later that day.   
365  
When interviewed by OPR in 2020, this same attorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite 
the fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state 
identified in the information charging Epstein.

236 
civil suits that were pending against Epstein.366  Villafaña also emailed one of the pro bono 
attorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal 
investigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the 
USAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the 
victims.”  Villafaña advised Goldberger:  “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].  
I do not know whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under 
seal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.” 
B. 
July 7, 2008:  The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated 
On July 3, 2008, victims’ attorney Edwards spoke to Villafaña by telephone about the 
resolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”367  In 
his 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation, 
Villafaña did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was 
beginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.”  However, in an 
email Villafaña sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that 
“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to know if we can get out of the deal.”  
Villafaña told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the 
agreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of 
hesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be 
allowed to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”368   
That same day, Edwards wrote a letter to Villafaña, complaining that Epstein’s state court 
sentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafaña to “move 
forward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes 
Mr. Epstein has committed.”   
On July 7, 2008, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane 
Doe.”  She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane 
Doe 1” and “Jane Doe 2.”369  Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights 
under the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting 
with the victims.  The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the 
CVRA.  The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were 
366  
According to Villafaña’s handwritten notes from June 30, 2008, Villafaña left a message for two of the 
attorneys.  
367  
In his 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on 
June 30, 2008, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2008.  
368  
Sloman responded, “Thanks.”  
369  
Later attempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.

237 
no federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2007 to 
defer prosecution to the state.370  
C. 
July 2008:  Villafaña Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Letter to Listed 
Victims 
On July 8, 2008, Villafaña provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 30, 2008 
letter.  Villafaña also informed the defense that, beginning the following day, she would distribute 
notifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s attorney 
would be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages.  Finally, the 
letter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one 
of these victims is entitled to proceed under 18 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the 
terms of the NPA. 
After exchanging emails and letters with the defense concerning the content of the notice 
letter, Villafaña drafted a letter she sent, on July 9 and 10, to nine victims who had previously 
retained counsel.  The letter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of” Epstein’s 
June 30, 2008 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to 
engage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of 18 months’ imprisonment followed by 12 
months’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
this state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.”  The letter included a reference to the 
U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used 
language from Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein defense attorney Sanchez clarifying 
the damages provision.  The paragraph below was described as “[o]ne such condition to which 
Epstein has agreed”: 
Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an 
offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she 
would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense.  For purposes of implementing 
this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to 
name . . . as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.  Any 
judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority 
determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, 
shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these 
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.  
On July 10, 2008, Villafaña sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,” 
highlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to 
370  
As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the matter continued in litigation for years and resulted in the 
district court’s February 21, 2019 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA 
by failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 263 of 348

238 
U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to 
name as victims of an enumerated offense.” 371  The same day, Villafaña sent Goldberger a second 
letter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.   
Villafaña informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to 
the listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to 
confirm their addresses for notification by mail.  With regard to the content of the telephone calls, 
Villafaña proposed the following language to the case agents: 
We are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein 
investigation and to thank you for your help. 
Mr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him 
to register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of 18 
months imprisonment followed by one year of home confinement.  
Mr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of 
restitution.   
All of these terms are set out in a letter that AUSA Villafaña is going 
to send out.  Do you have a lawyer?  Get name or address.  If not[,] 
where do you want [the] letter sent?  If you have questions when 
you receive the letter, please understand that we cannot provide 
legal advice but the lawyers at the following victim rights 
organizations are able to help you at no cost to you.  (Provide names 
and phone numbers) 
Also ask about counseling and let them know that counseling is still 
available even though the investigation is closed.  
On July 21, 2008, Villafaña sent the letter to the 11 unrepresented victims whose addresses 
the FBI had by that time confirmed.  Villafaña provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of 
the letter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).   
D. 
July – August 2008:  The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Letter to Victims 
Residing Outside of the United States 
While attempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact 
information for two victims residing outside of the United States.  On July 23 and August 8, 2008, 
respectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmitted an automated VNS form notification letter to 
each victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country.  This 
371  
A month later, in an August 18, 2008 letter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim 
list to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2007 execution of the NPA.  Villafaña also raised 
with Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to 
include new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2008 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously 
given a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list.  Ultimately, Villafaña sent the defense a 
letter confirming that the government’s July 10, 2008 victim list was “the final list.”

letter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification letter the FBI had sent to 
victims (in 2006, 2007, and 2008) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a 
federal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.   
The letter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 30, 2008, or 
that the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state 
plea.  Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated letter, the letter requested the victims’ 
“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”  
For each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafaña also drafted a 
notification letter concerning the June 30, 2008 plea and the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were 
to be hand delivered along with the FBI’s letters.  However, FBI records do not reflect whether 
the USAO’s letter was delivered to the two victims.     
E. 
August – September 2008:  The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose 
the NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Letter  
On August 1, 2008, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to 
the NPA.  The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.372  
On August 21, 2008, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of 
the NPA subject to a protective order.  In addition, the court ordered the government to produce 
the NPA to other identified victims upon request: 
(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as 
victims of Epstein and/or any attorney(s) for those individuals 
request the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall 
produce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals 
also agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any 
third party absent further court order, following notice to and an 
opportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]373 
In September 2008, the USAO sent a revised notification letter to victims, and attorneys 
for represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not 
contest liability in victim civil suits brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.374  The September letter 
appeared to address concerns raised by Epstein attorney Lefkowitz that the government’s earlier 
notification letter referenced language concerning 18 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had 
proposed in Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein attorney Sanchez, but that the defense 
had not accepted.375  As a result of the defense objection, Villafaña determined that she was

for the NPA.

374  
The USAO also sent a notification letter to additional victims who had not received a notification letter in 
July. 
375  
This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.

obligated to amend her prior letter to victims to correct the reference to the December letter.376  
Accordingly, the September letter contained no information about the parties’ intent in 
implementing 18 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s 
waiver of his right to contest liability under the provision.  In addition, the September letter 
described the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an attorney to 
represent the victims in their 18 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement 
to pay the attorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation.  The letter also clarified that 
Epstein’s agreement to pay for attorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.   
The government also intended for the letter to comply with the court’s order concerning 
providing victims with copies of the NPA.  The initial draft included a paragraph advising the 
victims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:   
In addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make 
available to any designated victim (and/or her attorney) a copy of 
the actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so 
long as the victim (and/or her attorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to 
be bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court.  If [the victim] 
would like to review the Agreement, please let me know, and I will 
forward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.  
The government shared draft versions of the September letter with Epstein’s counsel and 
responded to criticism of the content of the proposed letter.  For example, in response to the above 
language regarding the August 21, 2008 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued 
that there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice 
that the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality 
provisions of the [NPA].”  In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafaña 
revised the paragraph as follows:  
In addition, there has been litigation between the United States and 
two other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement 
between the United States and Mr. Epstein.  [The attorney selected 
by the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or 
if you select another attorney to represent you, that attorney can 
review the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].   
On September 18, 2009, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been 
filed in the state case.377 
376  
In the letter, Villafaña expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December 19, 2007 
letter that was included in the July 2008 notification letter, noting that the July 2008 letter had been approved by 
defense counsel before being sent.

F. 
2010 – 2011:  Department and Congressional Actions Regarding 
Interpretation of the CVRA 
In connection with the Department’s 2010 effort to update its 2005 Guidelines, the Office 
of the Deputy Attorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to 
revisit its 2005 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA 
and solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement 
agencies.  In response, OLC issued a December 17, 2010 opinion entitled, The Availability of 
Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004.  Based on the CVRA’s 
language, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC 
reaffirmed its 2005 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed 
(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are 
dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal 
charges after the filing of a complaint).”378   
After OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2005 Guidelines in October 2011 
but did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal 
charges were filed.  The 2011 revision did, however, add language concerning victim consultation 
before a defendant is charged:  “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has 
been brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the 
filing of a charging instrument with the court.”379  The use of the word “should” in the 2011 
Guidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an 
appropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”380  Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be 
general in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”381  The revisions 
also specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea 
proceedings.382      
On November 2, 2011, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a letter to 
Attorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2011 Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite 
clearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2011 Guidelines did “not extend any rights 
to victims until charges have been filed.”  The Department’s response emphasized that the 
378  
OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a matter of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA 
rights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.   
379  
See 2011 Guidelines, Art. V, ¶ G.2, available at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/ 
ag_guidelines2012. pdf.   In its 2011 online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such 
consultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-
indictment plea negotiations.   
380  
See 2011 Guidelines, Art. I, ¶ B.2. 
381  
See 2011 Guidelines, Art. V, ¶ G.2. 
382  
The 2005 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to 
exercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing.  See 2005 Guidelines, Art. IV, 
¶ C.3.b.(2).  However, the 2005 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the 
CVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.  The 2011 revision 
remedied this omission.

Department had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to 
assert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.”  The response also referenced OLC’s December 
2010 opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting 
that “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make 
reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective 
plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”383 
In 2015, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the following two rights: 
(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain 
or deferred prosecution agreement.  
(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the 
services described in section 503(c) of the Victims’ Rights and 
Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10FௗDQGSURYLGHGFRQWDFW

G. 
The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status  
While the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous 
federal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge 
as “related cases,” as a matter of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules.  As the parties 
agreed on settlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.384  Several of the victims who had 
settled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their 
anonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.385    
In the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights 
to confer by (1) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending letters to the 
victims claiming that the matter was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and 
(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal 
investigation.  In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right 
to be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right 
to reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the 
NPA and resolved the federal investigation.     
During the litigation, the USAO argued that (1) the victims had no right to notice or 
conferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s 
383  
157 Cong. Rec. S7359-02 (2011) (Kyl letter and Department response). 
384  
Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well.  In addition, numerous 
other cases were resolved outside of formal litigation.  For example, one attorney told OPR that he resolved 16 victim 
cases, but did not file all cases with the court.  Court data indicate that the attorney filed only 3 of the 16 cases he said 
he resolved.

243 
letters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the matter was 
“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that 
Epstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafaña contacted the petitioners’ attorney prior to Epstein’s 
state plea to advise him of the hearing.  Nonetheless, Villafaña told OPR that, while there were 
valid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is 
a case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required.  I was obviously 
prepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].” 
Over the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the 
provisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “attach 
before the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.”  The court also held that 
(1) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a 
non-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the 
statute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”; 
(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal 
investigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes committed by Epstein render 
the Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable 
defense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”   
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial 
Summary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its 
intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.”  The government did not 
dispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court 
concluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners 
that it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.”  The court found that the post-
NPA letters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the 
victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material 
omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an 
investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”386  
The court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the 
government’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea 
agreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is 
entered into without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard 
regarding any aspect of the case.”  The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure 
to communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with 
Epstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with 
the Court.”     
Although the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2005 Guidelines for the 
Department’s position that CVRA rights do not attach until after a defendant is charged, the court 
was “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold 
information about the NPA from the victims.”  The court found that the government’s reliance on 
386  
The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of 
Epstein’s state court plea hearing.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 269 of 348

244 
the 2005 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with 
Epstein’s attorneys, in which the government acknowledged that “it had obligations to notify the 
victims.”  The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate 
remedies.  Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission 
of the NPA; a written apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta, 
Villafaña, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials; 
training for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and attorneys’ fees.387  
Following Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death 
while in custody, on September 16, 2019, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied 
the petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the 
most significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s 
violation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”388  The court did not 
order the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government 
will honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the 
proper treatment of crime victims.”389  The court also denied the petitioners’ request for attorneys’ 
fees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the 
merits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted 
legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”   
On September 30, 2019, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested 
remedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Eleventh Circuit.390  In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and 
“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”391  Nevertheless, the 
government argued that, “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because 
no criminal charges were brought.”392  The government conceded, however, that with regard to 
the New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein

388  
Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. 16, 2019).  Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention 
that it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and 
to receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flow from the right to confer and were 
encompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”

The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal 
System to the USAO on January 10, 2020.

U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.   
392  
The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2015 to include a victim’s right to be 
notified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to 
non-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court 
involvement.

245 
victims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal 
case, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.”  During oral 
argument on January 16, 2020, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:    
The issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with 
Ms. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA, 
and they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was 
ongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.  The government 
should have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way 
with Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.393 
On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied 
Wild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the 
commencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the 
petitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”394  The court conducted a thorough analysis 
of the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions.  The court 
distinguished In re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any 
analysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.”  The court noted that its 
interpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2010 OLC opinion concerning 
victim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”  
Finally, the court raised separation of powers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s) 
interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would 
interfere with prosecutorial discretion.    
Nevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying 
case, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding 
information it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from 
passive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”  The court concluded that 
although it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other 
victims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the 
government was obligated to do so.  In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly 
worded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the 
“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal 
restriction.”  
On May 5, 2020, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.  On August 7, 2020, the court 
granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this 
Report, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2020.

DEPARTMENT POLICY:  THE 2005 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR 
VICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2005 GUIDELINES) 
In 2005, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to 
incorporate the provisions of the CVRA.  The purpose of the 2005 Guidelines was “to establish 
guidelines to be followed by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative, 
prosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”    
The relevant portions of the 2005 Guidelines are as follows: 
Article IV:  Services to Victims and Witnesses 
A. Investigation Stage 
The investigative agency’s responsibilities begin with the report of the crime and extend 
through the prosecution of the case. In some instances, when explicitly stated, the 
investigative agency’s responsibility for a certain task is transferred to the prosecuting 
agency when charges are filed. 
. . . . 
2.  Identification of Victims. At the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at 
which it may be done without interfering with an investigation, the responsible official of 
the investigative agency shall identify the victims of the crime.  
3.  Description of Services. 
     a.  Information, Notice, and Referral 
(1)  Initial Information and Notice. Responsible officials must advise a victim 
pursuant to this section at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which 
it may be done without interfering with an investigation.  To comply with this 
requirement, it is recommended that victims be given a printed brochure or card 
that briefly describes their rights and the available services, identifies the local

250 
service providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness 
coordinator or specialist and other key officials.  A victim must be informed of— 
(a)  His or her rights as enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  
(b)  His or her right entitlement, on request, to the services listed in 42 U.S.C. 
§ 10607(c).  
(c)  The name, title, business address, and telephone number of the responsible 
official to whom such a request for services should be addressed.  
(d)  The place where the victim may receive emergency medical or social 
services.  
(e)  The availability of any restitution or other relief (including crime victim 
compensation programs) to which the victim may be entitled under this or any 
other applicable law and the manner in which such relief may be obtained.  
(f)  Public and private programs that are available to provide counseling, 
treatment, and other support to the victim.  
. . . .  
(i)  The availability of services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, 
or stalking.  
(j)  The option of being included in VNS.  
(k)  Available protections from intimidation and harassment.  
. . . . 
(3) Notice during the investigation. During the investigation of a crime, a 
responsible official shall provide the victim with the earliest possible notice 
concerning— 
(a)  The status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent that it is 
appropriate and will not interfere with the investigation.  
(b)  The arrest of a suspected offender.  
B.  Prosecution Stage 
The prosecution stage begins when charges are filed and continues through postsentencing 
legal proceedings, including appeals and collateral attacks.

1.  Responsible Officials. For cases in which charges have been instituted, the responsible 
official is the U.S. Attorney in whose district the prosecution is pending.  
2.  Services to Crime Victims 
. . . . 
b.  Information, Notice, and Referrals 
(1)  Notice of Rights. Officers and employees of the Department of Justice shall 
make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of the rights enumerated 
in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  
(2)  Notice of Right To Seek Counsel. The prosecutor shall advise the crime victim 
that the crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights 
described in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  
(3)  Notice of Right To Attend Trial. The responsible official should inform the 
crime victim about the victim’s right to attend the trial regardless of whether the 
victim intends to make a statement or present any information about the effect of 
the crime on the victim during sentencing.  
(4)  Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, a responsible official 
shall provide the victim, using VNS (where appropriate), with reasonable notice 
of— 
(a)  The filing of charges against a suspected offender.  
(b)  The release or escape of an offender or suspected offender.  
(c)  The schedule of court proceedings. 
(i)  The responsible official shall provide the victim with reasonable, 
accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding or parole 
proceeding that involves the crime against the victim. In the event of an 
emergency or other last-minute hearing or change in the time or date of a 
hearing, the responsible official should consider providing notice by 
telephone or expedited means. This notification requirement relates to 
postsentencing proceedings as well.  
(ii)  The responsible official shall also give reasonable notice of the 
scheduling or rescheduling of any other court proceeding that the victim or 
witness is required or entitled to attend.  
(d)  The acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the rendering of 
a verdict after trial.

252 
(e)  If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised 
release, if any, that are imposed.  
. . . . 
(6)  Referrals. Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim 
in contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief 
[previously identified]. 
c.  Consultation With a Government Attorney 
(1)  In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case.  The victim’s right to confer, however, shall not be 
construed to impair prosecutorial discretion.  Federal prosecutors should be 
available to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals, 
release of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for 
noninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion.  Because 
victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose 
whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations 
may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only 
nonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the 
prosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct. 
Representatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither 
the Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department 
may make on their behalf constitutes or creates an attorney-client relationship 
between such victims and the lawyers for the Government. 
Department personnel should not provide legal advice to victims. 
(2)  Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult 
with victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays 
in the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court 
of the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor. 
(3)  Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable 
efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, 
prospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible 
official should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving 
notice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not 
limited to, the following factors: 
(a)  The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety. 
(b)  The number of victims. 
(c)  Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.

253 
(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions. 
(e)  Whether there is another need for confidentiality. 
(f)  Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that 
relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial. 
III. 
FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT  
A. 
FRPC 4-4.1 – Candor in Dealing with Others 
FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact 
or law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.  A comment to this rule 
explains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or 
omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular 
statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.” 
B. 
FRPC 4-8.4 – Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice 
FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit, or misrepresentation.   
FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice 
of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.   
As previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct 
that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice 
of law.”  Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 41 So. 3d at 172.

CHAPTER THREE 
PART THREE:  ANALYSIS 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
In addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of 
the NPA, public and media attention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims.  In 
the CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not 
informed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the 
government did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of 
Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to attend; and 
actively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing.  The district 
court overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and 
that “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have 
patience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”395  
The government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that 
the prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from 
complaining publicly or in state court.   
OPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims, 
including the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision 
to defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision 
to delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 30, 2008.  
OPR considered whether letters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained 
false or misleading statements.  OPR also evaluated representations Villafaña made to victims in 
January and February 2008, and to an attorney for a victim in June 2008.   
II. 
THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS 
STANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE 
VICTIMS 
During the CVRA litigation, the government acknowledged that the USAO did not consult 
with victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA.  In its February 21, 2019 
opinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about 
its intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.”  OPR considered this 
finding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined 
whether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, federal prosecutors were obligated 
to consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject attorneys—Acosta, 
Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafaña—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that 
obligation.

256 
As discussed below, OPR concludes that none of the subject attorneys violated a clear and 
unambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without 
a federal criminal charge.  In September 2007, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not 
interpret CVRA rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal 
courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal 
charges were brought.  Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find 
professional misconduct unless a subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and 
unambiguous standard.  Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject attorneys’ conduct did not rise to 
the level of professional misconduct.  OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation 
was part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court 
condemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as 
a whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and 
confusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”396  
A. 
At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to 
Notify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of 
Criminal Charges 
Although the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of 
whether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights attach was neither clear nor 
unambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2007.  At that 
time, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district 
court’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.  
The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a 
result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”  On April 
1, 2005, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ 
may be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the 
status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that 
directly caused the victim’s harm.”  Beginning with the 2005 OLC guidance, the Department has 
consistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal 
charges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information.  OLC applied its 
definition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2005, but noted that the obligation created by the 
eighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal 
officials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 [(VRRA)] indicates that this right 
applies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”397  Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in 
May 2005, the Department issued the 2005 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.   
The 2005 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the 
initiation of federal charges.  Specifically, the 2005 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution 
stage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, 
396  
2005 Guidelines, Foreword. 
397  
Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2005 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § 10606, 
had been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.

257 
and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.398  The “prosecution stage” 
began when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.399     
At the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2007, few courts had addressed victim 
standing under the CVRA.  Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that 
standing attached only upon the filing of federal charges.400  Two cases relied upon by the court 
in its February 2019 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were 
decided after the NPA was signed.  
The CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this 
Report—show that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a matter 
of debate.401  In a November 21, 2019 letter to Attorney General William Barr, a Congressional 
Representative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that 
victims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key 
pre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”402  The CVRA 
litigation arising from the Epstein case shows the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights 
apply:  the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided 
panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has 
now been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.   
Because the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the 
lower courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA 
rights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims 
before signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA 
did not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of 
federal criminal charges.403

Violations of an unambiguous obligation concerning victims’ rights could result in a violation of the rules of 
professional responsibility.  For example, in Attorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, 109 A.3d 1184 (Md. 2015), the 
Court of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster 
family about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the matter 
was a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived 
the victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution.  The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional

258 
In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language 
of the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge 
phase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its 
investigation of Epstein.  As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights 
and services; however, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court 
or by administrative complaint.  Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the 
victims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an attorney for 
the government.  However, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the 
CVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.  
The portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain 
victim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect following passage 
of the CVRA.  Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official 
to “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and 
another requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of 
the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and 
to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein 
investigation.  However, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part 
of the subject attorneys, as the 2005 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two 
requirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors.  Moreover, the VRRA did not 
require notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained 
“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under 
the NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2008.  Once Epstein did so, and the victims 
identified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the 
victims with appropriate notification.   
B. 
OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was 
Intended to Silence Victims 
During her OPR interviews, Villafaña recalled more than one discussion in which she 
raised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on 
September 24, 2007.  Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, however, had no recollection of 
discussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed 
Villafaña’s assertions.  OPR found only one written reference before that date, explicitly raising 
the issue of consultation.  Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to 
conclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision 
made by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about 
the NPA before it was signed.  Villafaña’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman 
may have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not 
believe that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations.  OPR 
Conduct 1.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.  The holding in Smith 
was based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among 
others, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or 
information filed in a circuit court.”  However, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts 
are substantially different from the Epstein investigation.  In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and 
charged before entering a plea.

did not find evidence showing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from 
having input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.    
Although the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification 
decisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, the records contain little about 
the subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed.  In a 
September 6, 2007 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning 
in earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafaña raised the topic of victim 
consultation with Sloman:  “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their 
approval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . . 
[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”404  
Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.”  Villafaña recalled that after she 
sent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that now.”405  Villafaña also told 
OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-
charge resolutions do not require victim notification.”  Villafaña also recalled a discussion with 
Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input 
on the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.  
You can’t disclose them.”406    
None of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about 
the USAO’s CVRA obligations.  Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to 
consult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of settlement negotiations; 
moreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.   
Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering 
into the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.”  Sloman 
believed the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we 
handled, filed cases.”  Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution 
of the matter, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the 
victims] prior to entering into . . . the NPA.”   
Lourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about 
the terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafaña that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.  
He stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the 
victims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that. . . . [I]f you 
look at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim 
this and that, you’re missing the big picture.”    
404  
As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims 
because no criminal charges had been filed.  In addition, Villafaña’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate 
because the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.   
405  
Villafaña did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.  
406  
Villafaña also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations 
could cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”  Villafaña was 
uncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2007.

260 
Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was 
“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.”  Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’ 
views were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I 
was focused on at least at this time.”  Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored 
into the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknowledged 
to OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much better if we had 
[consulted with the victims].”407 
As indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect little about decisions made regarding 
victim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed.  Villafaña raised the issue in writing to her 
supervisors in early September, but there is no evidence showing whether her supervisors 
affirmatively rejected Villafaña’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims, 
ignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended 
uncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal.  OPR notes 
that its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the 
passage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed.  Although Villafaña 
recalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and 
Menchel contended that Villafaña’s recollection is inaccurate.  Assuming the discussions occurred, 
the timing is unclear.  Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafaña 
about victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely.  Any discussion involving Menchel 
necessarily occurred before August 3, 2007, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree 
to the government’s offer.  Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there 
was little to discuss with victims.   
To the extent that Villafaña’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult 
victims, Villafaña’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about 
the confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to 
consult with victims about a pre-charge disposition.  That belief accurately reflected the 
Department’s position at the time about application of the CVRA.  Importantly, OPR did not find 
evidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and 
Villafaña told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting 
to the agreement if they learned of it.  Because the subjects did not violate any clear and 
unambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR 
concludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct. 
However, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s 
treatment of the victims.  Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a 
more straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal 
to treat victims of crime with fairness and respect.  This was particularly important in a case in 
which victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process.  Furthermore, in this case, 
consulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into 
the victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.  The consultation provision does not 
407  
Villafaña told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order 
to . . . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”

require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allows victims the opportunity to express 
their views and to be heard before a final decision is made.  The lack of consultation in this case 
denied the victims that opportunity.408   
III. 
LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS 
BUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
After the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, Villafaña and the FBI separately 
communicated with numerous victims and victims’ attorneys, both in person and through letters.  
Apart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2007 about a 
resolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more 
generally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled 
guilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2008.  Despite the 
government’s agreement on September 24, 2007, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s 
compliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2007, January 2008, and 
May 2008, letters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.”  In its February 21, 
2019 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those letters “misl[ed] the victims to 
believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for 
the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about 
which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”409   
In the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of 
conduct with victims after the NPA was signed.  As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did 
not find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña acted with the intent to 
silence victims.  Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s 
interactions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning 
the federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.   
In this section, OPR examines and discusses letters sent to victims by the FBI that were the 
subject of the district court’s findings.  OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña 
was aware of the content of the letters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production 
for the CVRA litigation.  OPR determined that the January 10, 2008 and May 30, 2008 letters that 
the district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October 12, 2007 letter OPR located 
during its investigation, were “standard form letter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist.  As 
noted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the FBI agents continued 
to conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a 
408  
Villafaña told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was 
signed and “ask[ing] them how they wanted the case to be resolved.”  FBI interview reports indicate that Villafaña 
was present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations.  See 2005 
Guidelines, Art. IV, ¶ B.2.c (1) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying 
only nonsensitive data and public information).  However, Villafaña did not meet with all of the victims identified in 
the federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA 
litigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.  Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at 1218.

breach, however, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.  
Thus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the 
omission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims 
of important information about the exact status of the investigation.   
A. 
The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Letters Sent by the 
FBI in October 2007, January 2008, and May 2008 Describing the Status of 
the Case as “Under Investigation”  
The 2005 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and 
available services during the “investigative stage” of a case.  During the Epstein investigation, the 
FBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets 
to victims following their interviews and through computer-generated letters sent to the victims by 
the FBI’s Victim Specialist.  The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s.  The 
USAO has its own Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim 
notification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”   
The FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2007, January 2008, and 
May 2008 letters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the 
2005 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative 
stage.”  The stock language of that letter, however, was generic and failed to communicate the 
unique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time.  The FBI Victim Specialist 
who sent the letters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the 
NPA at the time she created the letters.410  Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the letters sent 
by the FBI’s Victim Specialist.411  According to Villafaña, “The decision to issue the letters and 
the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.”  Although the FBI case agents 
informed Villafaña after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form letter,” 
Villafaña had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification letter and was not aware of its 
contents.412  Villafaña told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI letters until they were 
collected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2008.  
410  
The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a letter, 
but acknowledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”  
411  
The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the letters and believed them to be “standard form 
letters.”  Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go 
from the victim coordinator.”  
412  
Villafaña’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI letters led to some inconsistency in the 
information provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights.  Beginning in 2006, the FBI provided to victims 
standard letters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied 
pre-charge.  During this period, Villafaña also crafted her own introductory letters to the victims to let them know of 
their CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation 
in which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Attorney’s Office.”  Villafaña told 
OPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate 
questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.”  Villafaña’s letter itemized the CVRA 
rights, but it did not explain that those rights attached only after a formal charge had been made.  The letter was hand

263 
B. 
Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the 
FBI Letters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the 
Status of the Federal Investigation 
As described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay 
entering his guilty plea, Villafaña and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to 
comply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein.  By April 
2008, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.”  As a result, 
Villafaña and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional 
investigative steps.  Among other actions, Villafaña, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents 
engaged in the following investigative activities:  
x The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2007 and between January and 
May 2008, and discovered at least six new victims.   
x In January 2008, CEOS assigned a Trial Attorney to bring expertise and “a national 
perspective” to the matter. 
x In January and February 2008, Villafaña and the CEOS Trial Attorney participated in 
victim interviews. 
x Villafaña revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknown to 
Epstein’s counsel.”   
x The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM 
[§] 8-3.120,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation matter” 
involving Epstein and others.  
x Villafaña secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being 
sought by Epstein’s attorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.413 
x Villafaña prepared a revised draft indictment. 
x Villafaña sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government 
witness in exchange for that witness’s testimony. 
x Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 30, 2008, Villafaña took steps to 
facilitate the filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead guilty. 
Villafaña told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim letter that the 
case was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.”  Similarly, the FBI case agent told 
OPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was 
delivered, along with the FBI’s own victim’s rights pamphlet and notification letter, to victims following their FBI 
interviews.   
413  
According to the 2017 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case attorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that 
Villafaña secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 289 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page35 of 217

264 
continuing.”  The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2019, 
the “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut down.”   
OPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim letters were drafted with the intent to mislead 
the victims about the status of the federal investigation.  The “ongoing investigation” language 
generated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical 
to that contained in standard form notification letters the FBI generated and distributed from 
August 2006 through the 2007 signing of the NPA.414  Nevertheless, the FBI’s letters omitted 
important information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a 
federal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an 
agreement he had reached with the USAO.  Victims receiving the FBI’s letter would logically 
conclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal 
prosecution.  CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of 
this letter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving 
forward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her.  Furthermore, when the 
fact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2007 eventually came 
to light, the statement in the subsequent letters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions 
that the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.   
In sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim letters that the matter was 
“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to 
investigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein.  The letters, however, risked misleading the 
victims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the letters did not provide 
important information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.  
Nonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafaña or her supervisors participated in drafting 
those letters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s letters until the Department gathered them 
for production in the CVRA litigation.  The use of FBI form letters that gave incomplete 
information about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the 
federal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of 
attention to and oversight regarding communication with victims.  Despite the fact that the case 
was no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form letters continued to be 
sent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information 
provided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.415          
414  
The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System 
indicates that letters the FBI system generated in 2006 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial 
(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and letters generated in 2008 contained stock language for the 
notification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.” 
415  
After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form letter requesting “assistance and 
cooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.

IV. 
ACOSTA’S 
DECISION 
TO 
DEFER 
TO 
THE 
STATE 
ATTORNEY’S 
DISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE 
COURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS 
STANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY 
FAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING 
As set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became 
clear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to 
inform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing.  The USAO initially 
took the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA, 
including the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that 
victims who wanted to attend could do so.   
In November and December 2007, Epstein’s attorneys challenged the USAO’s position 
regarding victim notification.  Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim 
notifications.  Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected 
to defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing 
pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights requirements.  Acosta also determined that the USAO 
would notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255, 
a decision that was implemented by letters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.  
This decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas, 
was based, at least in part, on Villafaña’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to 
preserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, below.   
In this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for 
notifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing.  OPR concludes that neither the CVRA 
nor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore 
Acosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State 
Attorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing.  However, OPR 
also concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state 
intended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims 
forthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department.  Through counsel, Acosta 
“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard 
“never before expected of any U.S. Attorney.”  OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the 
discussion below.   
A. 
Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Attorney’s Discretion Whether to 
Notify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any 
Clear or Unambiguous Standard 
In November 2007, Villafaña sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct 
concerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a written notice to victims informing 
them of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting 
them to appear at the state plea hearing.  Villafaña and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft letter 
and, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense attorney Lefkowitz, who, in turn, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 291 of 348
SA-291
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page37 of 217

266 
strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he 
described as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified 
individuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”  
Thereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafaña 
drafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2007 letter to Lefkowitz rejecting the defense 
arguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in 
the federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing.  The letter took an expansive 
view of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the 
USAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings: 
[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district 
court.  Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal 
investigation by allowing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.  
The victims identified through the federal investigation should be 
appropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does 
not require the U.S. Attorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal 
obligations.416 
The letter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with 
information concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice 
of the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea.  Along with 
the letter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification letter to Lefkowitz for his 
comments.  This draft victim notification letter stated that the federal investigation had been 
completed, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend 18 months of 
imprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims 
brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The draft victim notification letter provided specific information 
concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to attend or provide a 
written statement to the State Attorney’s Office.  When Lefkowitz asked Sloman to delay sending 
victim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafaña, who was 
preparing letters for transmittal to 30 victims, to “Hold the letter.”  During his OPR interview, 
Sloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the letter out,” but he “must have had a conversation 
with somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed 
Villafaña to hold the letter.  
In his response letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz contended that the government had 
misinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in 
this matter [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”  
416  
Sloman told Lefkowitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the 
victims of their rights.”  Sloman also addressed the defense attorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could 
contact Villafaña or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal 
law requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in this case.’”

267 
Thereafter, in his December 19, 2007 letter to defense counsel mainly addressing other 
matters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Attorney’s discretion 
the responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing: 
I understand that the defense objects to the victims being given 
notice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and] 
sentencing hearing.  I have reviewed the proposed victim 
notification letter and the statute.  I would note that the United States 
provided the draft letter to the defense as a courtesy.  In addition, 
First Assistant United States Attorney Sloman already incorporated 
in the letter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.  
I agree that Section 3771 applies to notice of proceedings and results 
of investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.  We 
intend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as 
required by law.  We will defer to the discretion of the State Attorney 
regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the 
state proceedings, although we will provide him with the 
information necessary to do so if he wishes.   
(Emphasis added.) 
Acosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [letter] without running it by [Sloman], 
if not other individuals in the office.”  Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State 
Attorney, or for our office to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to 
the state outcome.”  Acosta acknowledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s 
handling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever 
obligation they have.  Let’s not assume. . . that the State Attorney’s office is full of bad actors.” 
Sloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially 
because they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was 
an agreement made that we were going to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to 
decide how the victims were going to be notified.”417  Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding 
under the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal 
case,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if 
we g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . . . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be 
instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.” 
OPR could not determine whether the State Attorney’s Office notified any victims in 
advance of the June 30, 2008 state plea hearing.  Krischer told OPR that the State Attorney’s Office 
had a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether 
or how it was used in the Epstein case.  Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether 
victims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the 
417  
Sloman stated in his June 3, 2008 letter to Deputy Attorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision 
together with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker.  Acosta did consult 
with Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled 
discussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played 
a role in the deferral decision.

particular charges and victims at issue.  Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafaña to 
contact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2008, she reported back 
to Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”418  Villafaña recalled that she 
sent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said 
he would “contact as many as he could.”  The contemporaneous records do not show how many 
or which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom.  No victim 
who provided information to OPR, either in person or through her attorney, recalled receiving 
notice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials.  At the time Epstein pled guilty in state 
court, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Attorney’s Office had 
notified about the proceeding.  Accordingly, Villafaña, who was present in the courtroom for the 
hearing, had no knowledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims 
were “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”419   
OPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Attorney’s Office the 
decision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional 
misconduct.  OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring 
notice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled 
to attend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.  
Furthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not 
apply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.420  Moreover, the section of the VRRA 
requiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to attend” referred specifically to 
proceedings under 42 U.S.C. § 10606(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become 
part of the CVRA (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2)).421 
Because Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the 
federal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State 
Attorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing 
so did not constitute professional misconduct.422   
418  
Sloman replied, “Good.”  In her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated, “I requested permission to make 
oral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification 
could only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”

B. 
Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims 
Identified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea 
Hearing  
Although Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the 
state’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that 
the federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state 
charges.  As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to 
interfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney.  His decision that the 
USAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Attorney’s 
judgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view.  However, OPR 
found no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State 
Attorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that 
the state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the 
victims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims 
that it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal 
investigation into their own cases.423 
Even taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to 
interfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem 
from passing the task of notifying victims to the State Attorney’s Office and made appropriate 
efforts to ensure that those problems were minimized.  Appropriate notification would have 
included advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to 
bring charges and that the matter was being handled by the State Attorney, and, at a minimum, 
provided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information.  Acosta could have interacted with 
the State Attorney, or instructed Villafaña or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make 
notifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information 
necessary to accomplish the task.  Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification 
entirely to the State Attorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of 
individuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state 
prosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.   
Epstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming 
that each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge 
involved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state 
offenses.  Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining 
whether the state intended to notify more than those few victims.  Moreover, the federal 
investigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by 
inform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.”  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 10607(c)(1)(B) 
and (c)(3)(A).   
423  
Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification 
obligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation 
exists, it cannot be deferred.”  OPR’s criticism, as explained further below, is not with the decision itself, but rather 
with the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed 
that they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without 
ensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.

the PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct.  Absent information from the USAO, 
the state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea 
proceeding, even if the State Attorney had decided to include other victims identified during the 
state investigation.  Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised 
by Villafaña that Belohlavek, in November 2007, had requested that the USAO notify victims, 
presumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing. 
Acosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the 
victims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak.  Acosta 
also told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-
encompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was 
not proceeding.”  There is no evidence, however, that he verified this understanding with Sloman 
or Villafaña, let alone the State Attorney.  OPR found no indication that Acosta ever 
communicated, or directed Sloman or Villafaña to communicate, his decision to the State Attorney 
or to provide the State Attorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the 
federal investigation.  OPR located a draft letter to the State Attorney’s Office that Villafaña 
prepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2007, which did provide such information, but 
OPR found no evidence that the letter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly 
released from the State Attorney’s Office.424  OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and 
Villafaña interacted with the State Attorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 30, 2008 
plea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that 
office, and Villafaña’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that 
the USAO had not coordinated with the State Attorney’s Office.  Belohlavek told OPR that no one 
from the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to 
appear at the hearing.    
Krischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it 
to them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding.  In the absence of some 
discussion of which or how many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to 
tell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea 
hearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.  
In other words, Acosta failed to plan for how all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both 
federal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an 
opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” 
OPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the 
plea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately 
was not unsupported.  State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the 
Florida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources, 
and processes to help accomplish notification.  However, Acosta was aware—through the 
prosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafaña—that the 
USAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD 
424  
The text of the letter indicated that Epstein’s attorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights 
they may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Attorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the 
State Attorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with 
any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”

271 
investigation.  Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than 
the total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO 
was certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to 
Acosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, there 
was a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not 
receive notice of the hearing.425  Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims 
could only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and 
the state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant 
issues relating to Epstein.  Villafaña and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the 
notification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played little role in complying with the state’s 
victim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning 
and coordination with the State Attorney’s Office.426   
Even if the State Attorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming 
plea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that 
the state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation 
as well.  The State Attorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status 
of the federal investigation, and there was little reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff, 
would voluntarily do so, thereby putting the State Attorney’s Office in the position of fielding 
victim questions and concerns about the outcome.  Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense 
had differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no 
indication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they 
could actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged 
crimes.427  
Through counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafaña and Sloman both told 
OPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason 
why Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.”  Acosta’s counsel further 
425  
 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state 
investigation.  Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear.  The PBPD’s 
probable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the 19 identified in the state 
investigation.  According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims.  After 
Epstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification letters to only 2 victims.  Belohlavek told OPR that because of the 
nature of the charges, she did not know whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required 
to notify of the plea hearing.   
426  
 The State Attorney’s Office had its own procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and 
Belohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim 
notification process.   
427  
Although Villafaña’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 960.001 and 921.143 when she 
drafted unsent letters to victims in November and December 2007 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing 
pursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been allowed to participate in 
the state plea hearing.  In Lefkowitz’s November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right 
to speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant 
was being sentenced.  In April 2008, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that 
Florida Statute § 921.143(l) did not allow the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing.  The court 
ruled that § 921.143(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.720(b) allows trial courts to consider at 
sentencing hearings.”  Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008).

272 
argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification 
task, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the 
victims of the hearing.428  Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management 
played no role in the victim notification process; however, in this case, the issue of victim 
notification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the 
defense.  Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense 
counsel in his December 19, 2007 letter.  Villafaña provided Acosta with a draft letter to state 
officials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified 
in the federal investigation.  OPR found no evidence, however, that Acosta sent the letter or any 
similar communication to the State Attorney’s Office or that he provided Villafaña and Sloman 
with instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December 19, 
2007 letter.  Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to 
ensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the 
state process.             
Many victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a letter 
from the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some 
victims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media.  In the end, 
although Villafaña and Sloman hastily attempted to ensure victim notification through Chief 
Reiter, their effort was too little and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to attend 
the plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their own cases.429  
Although Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for 
notifying victims to the State Attorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.  
OPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta 
personally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the 
federal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.  
Acosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe 
the CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware 
of the state court proceeding.  Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s 
conduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been 
consistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity, 
and sensitivity.  Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the 
428  
As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of 
poor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before 
expected of any US Attorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State 
Attorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had 
actually notified the victims.  For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain 
specific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted 
responsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider how or even whether that entity would be able 
to accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.      
429  
OPR notes that Villafaña contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting 
window of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short.  Had the USAO coordinated with the State Attorney 
at some point in time closer to Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that 
the State Attorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and 
that issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.  
Similarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the 
months that the matter was under review by the Department.

273 
resolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to attend the plea 
hearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast 
with Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s attorneys, which included the unusual 
courtesy of allowing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications.  This 
contrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the 
public.   
Nothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of 
determining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that 
all of the known federal victims received information about the state plea hearing.  Instead, as with 
his decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised 
poor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims, 
but also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to 
implement them.  Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility 
for making notifications entirely to the State Attorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO 
and the Department as a whole.  It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that 
resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with 
victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally 
sought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state 
proceeding.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to attend a hearing 
that was related to their own cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with 
forthrightness and dignity.  
V. 
VILLAFAÑA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER 
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN 
WHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID 
NOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS 
From September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 30, 2008 
state court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafaña’s direction, directly informed only three 
victims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the 
federal investigation would be closed.  During this time period, Villafaña and the case agents 
interacted with several victims and their attorneys, and Villafaña contacted victims’ attorney 
Bradley Edwards to encourage him to attend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform 
victims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.    
As described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and 
co-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.430  After speaking to three victims, however, 
the FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary 
damages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent 
should Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial.  As the case agent 
told OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue 
Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.”  The case 
430  
Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to 
Villafaña from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that 
she was unhappy with the resolution.

274 
agent and Villafaña consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the 
matter, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue 
monetary damages according to its terms.  
Villafaña advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment 
evidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] now, cross-
examination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are 
entitled to a large amount of damages right?’”  Explaining the decision in her later CVRA 
declaration, Villafaña said that after Epstein’s attorneys “complained that the victims were 
receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their 
damages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the 
witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.”  Acosta was aware of these 
concerns as he referred to them in an August 2008 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the 
victims would compromise them as potential witnesses.  Epstein argued very forcefully that they 
were doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a] 
key part of [the] agree[ment].”   
The case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2007, but did not inform 
them about the NPA.431  On January 31, 2008, the FBI agents, Villafaña, and the CEOS Trial 
Attorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one 
more victim the next day.432  Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of 
2007 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.   
Villafaña told OPR that during the January 31, 2008 interviews, she did not specifically 
tell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.”  She 
stated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand 
what that means.”  Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafaña, had been 
informed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where 
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually 
perform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”  
Villafaña recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court” 
that would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal 
investigation versus a state investigation.”  Villafaña told OPR she explained “the case was under 
investigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that 
charges would be brought.”  An email from Villafaña to Sloman and Acosta during this time period 
reflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date:  “The 
second girl . . . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had read about in the paper. . . .  
[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.”  Villafaña, 
however, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather, 
she likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.  In her own 2015 CVRA- 
case declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of 
431  
FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2008, without prosecutors, and did not inform the 
victims of the NPA.  
432  
Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, but the evidence is unclear as 
to whether the interviews occurred.

the federal investigation I was cooperating in.  If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have 
objected.”  Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me, 
I thought they were still investigating my case.”    
Neither the CEOS Trial Attorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim 
interviews.  The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited 
from the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of 
the case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.433   
When asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when 
she was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafaña told OPR that 
she believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued 
“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.  
As Villafaña stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is now back under investigation is 
perfectly accurate.” 
Villafaña was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with 
civil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ attorneys about the NPA.  
In a 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ attorney Bradley Edwards alleged that 
during telephone calls with Villafaña, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the 
investigation was in,” and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because the 
matter “was an on-going active investigation.”  Edwards stated that Villafaña gave him “the 
impression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, 
both in the number of identified victims and complexity.”  Edwards also stated, “A fair 
characterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafaña 
listened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”   
In her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke” 
during her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the 
possibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”  
Villafaña also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been 
given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any 
involvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information 
to Edwards. 
 Sloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO 
from exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to 
break down and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses 
and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $150,000, that’s . . . 
going to be instant impeachment for the defense.”434  Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did 
433  
As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to 
be prosecuted.  
434  
When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman 
responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.  I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly 
interested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.”  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 301 of 348

276 
not plead guilty in October 2007 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether 
the case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here 
has to be discretion to judge how much you can tell the victims and when.”   
Epstein’s attorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and 
Epstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafaña all 
identified.  As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and 
civil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against 
Epstein by the government’s promises of financial gain.  For example, during a February 20, 2008 
state deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI 
agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.435  In her 2017 declaration in 
the CVRA litigation, Villafaña identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the 
government’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
recovery.    
On June 27, 2008, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 30, 2008 state court guilty 
plea hearing, Villafaña contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.  Villafaña 
told OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s attorney other than Edwards 
about the scheduled state plea hearing.436  In his 2017 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation, 
Edwards stated that Villafaña “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that 
Epstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”   
Edwards said in a 2016 court filing that Villafaña told him only that “Epstein was pleading 
guilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s 
clients nor any of the federally-identified victims.”  Villafaña stated in her 2017 declaration that 
she “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the 
state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution 
charge to a specific victim.”  Villafaña told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his 
clients to attend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized 
by the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.”  In his 2017 affidavit, Edwards acknowledged 
that “Villafaña did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that 
way.”  Edwards claimed that Villafaña’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court 
would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement” 
resulted in his clients not attending the hearing.  Edwards himself was out of town and not able to 
435  
As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn 
information concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state 
prosecution.  For example, in a March 2008 email, Villafaña informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who 
had received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you know, doesn’t involve most 
of the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).”  Villafaña further observed that because Epstein 
is “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim] 
seems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”      
436  
Villafaña’s June 30, 2008 handwritten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea, 
Villafaña was aware of the identities of a least five other attorneys representing Epstein’s victims.  In her written 
response to OPR, Villafaña stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the 
upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator, 
and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”  On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman to inform 
him that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”  Sloman replied, “Good.”

attend the hearing.  In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have 
believed that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that 
federal investigation.”      
In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to 
Epstein’s attorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the 
January and May 2008 FBI letters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive 
nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”437  Although both the appellate 
court and district court focused on the FBI’s letters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafaña, 
Sloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether 
similar representations Villafaña made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 31 and 
February 1, 2008, and to Edwards, were misleading.  Therefore, OPR considered whether 
Villafaña’s statements that the matter was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the 
victims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.1(a), 4-8.4(c), or 
4-8.4(d). 
FRPC 4-4.1(a) prohibits an attorney from “knowingly mak[ing] a false statement of 
material fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client.  The FRPC defines 
“knowingly” as “denot[ing] actual knowledge of the fact in question” and states that such 
knowledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”438  The comment to FRPC 4-4.1 states that 
“[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that 
are the equivalent of affirmative false statements.”  The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[f]or 
dishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.”  Like FRPC 4-4.1(a), Rule 4-8.4(c) 
requires evidence that the attorney knew the statement in question was false.  Under FRPC 
4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by showing that the conduct was 
deliberate or knowing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative; 
instead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”439  In Feinberg, the court concluded that 
the prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.1 and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful 
statements to a defense attorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the 
defendant by making the statements.440  In this case, Villafaña was fully aware of the signed NPA 
when she interviewed the victims on January 31 and February 1, 2008, and when she spoke to 
Edwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA.  The 
question is whether this omission amounted to a knowing false statement or misrepresentation. 
One difficulty is determining what Villafaña actually said during conversations that 
participants were asked to recall many years later.  With respect to three of the victims whom she 
interviewed in January and February 2008, Villafaña contended that she discussed the agreement 
with them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as

278 
previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion.  Villafaña’s 
mention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to 
apprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.   
Nevertheless, Villafaña did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms 
with other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s 
attorney.  OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of 
the NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC 
4-4.1 or 4-8.4.441   
OPR evaluated Villafaña’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.1:   
A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a 
client’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an 
opposing party of relevant facts.  A misrepresentation can occur if 
the lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that 
the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by 
partially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the 
equivalent of affirmative false statements.   
The victims and their attorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the 
comment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third 
parties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.   
Here, the evidence does not show that Villafaña knowingly made an affirmative false 
statement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false 
statements” about material facts.  First, Villafaña told OPR that she believed the investigation was 
ongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the 
evidence shows that Villafaña and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein 
entered his guilty plea in state court in June 2008.  Villafaña’s email correspondence with her 
supervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to 
charge him.  The evidence similarly does not show that Villafaña knowingly made any affirmative 
false statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined 
to provide additional information in response to his questions.442    
Second, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafaña 
interacted with the victims and Edwards.  Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what 
information will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons.  In 
many cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses, 
441  
In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.1(a) and 4-8.4(c) 
“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].”  Florida Bar v. Joy, 
679 So. 2d 1165, 1166-68 (Fla. 1996).  See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 816 (Fla. 1994) (petition for 
reinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).    
442  
In Feinberg, 760 So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Attorney lacked candor and violated 
ethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his attorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the 
defense attorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 304 of 348

279 
and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with 
victims.  The 2005 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited 
in their disclosures:  “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, 
and may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations 
may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and 
public information.”443   
Villafaña’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing 
victims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.  
Indeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem, 
Villafaña agreed with the agents’ concerns.  Villafaña raised those concerns with the USAO’s 
Professional Responsibility Officer in October 2007 after the agents brought the issue to her 
attention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom 
advised her that those concerns were improper or unsound.  OPR also considered that although 
Villafaña had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her 
supervisor, the U.S. Attorney, had decided otherwise.  When authorized to inform Edwards of the 
scheduled change of plea hearing, she did so.  Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea 
was part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not show 
that Villafaña acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from attending the 
hearing.  Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to 
inform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from attending the state proceedings.  
Rather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafaña told him the hearing was “important.”  Villafaña sought 
to strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) attendance at the state court 
plea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the 
federal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.  
Therefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the 
evidence does not establish that Villafaña violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.1 or 4-8.4(c) 
or (d).444  Nonetheless, as discussed below, Villafaña’s interactions with victims and victims’ 
attorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal 
investigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was 
443  
2005 Guidelines, Art. IV, ¶ B.2.c(1).  As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein 
during interviews with the government and they, or their attorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about 
the government’s communications.  For example, within a day of Villafaña contacting a victim’s attorney about a 
potential victim notification letter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately 
provided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl’s attorney, even though it was clear from the 
girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.” 
444  
The case most directly on point is Smith, 109 A.3d 1184, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed 
a violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the 
resolution of a sex abuse case.  However, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and 
charged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an 
opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.”  In this case, 
for the reasons previously discussed, Villafaña did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims 
or Edwards of the NPA.

intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with 
victims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.445   
VI. 
THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND 
WITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS 
WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION   
Although OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects committed professional 
misconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in 
interactions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of 
action.  The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims, 
particularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully attempted to 
join in the CVRA litigation.  As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the matter is 
that the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s attorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims.  It 
is unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after 
Menchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim 
notification letters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the 
requirements of the CVRA or the 2005 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was 
signed.  This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2005 Guidelines, that 
Department employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime 
endure in its wake.”  When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by 
the Department. 
Wild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar 
to and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and 
that demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government.  Wild experienced 
a series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafaña and the 
case agents.  Wild received Villafaña’s letter in June 2007 stating inaccurately that she was a 
federal victim entitled to CVRA rights.  She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2007 but was 
not told that a potential outcome was a state plea.  Shortly after the September 24, 2007 signing of 
the NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case.  Nonetheless, 
on January 10, 2008, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights letter indicating that the case was under 
investigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was 
charged.  On January 31, 2008, Villafaña re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS attorney and 
the FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention 
the NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution.  In mid-June 2008, when 
Edwards contacted Villafaña on Wild’s behalf, Villafaña informed him that the case was under 
investigation but did not mention the NPA.  Just before Epstein’s June 30, 2008 state court plea, 
445  
OPR notes that, similar to Villafaña, Sloman interacted with a victim’s attorney during the time period 
between the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea.  In January 2008, Sloman received a telephone call 
from his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal 
government could bring charges against Epstein.  Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest 
allegations due to his prior business relations with the attorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.  
Because Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the attorney.     
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 306 of 348
SA-306
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page52 of 217

281 
Villafaña informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the 
state pleas would resolve the federal investigation.  Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and 
learned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had 
concluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas.  Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge 
permitted it in August 2008 pursuant to a protective order.  After considering this series of 
interactions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and 
believing she had been misled.   
OPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafaña, Acosta, Sloman, 
Menchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the 
NPA from public scrutiny.  Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion 
of CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knowing that victim consultation 
was not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to 
the point when he left the USAO.  The evidence is clear that Villafaña sought at various points to 
consult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the 
NPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address 
the issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her own concern about creating possible 
impeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.    
Nonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and 
after the signing of the NPA, would have been the better practice.  Before the NPA was signed, 
victims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was 
contemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being 
considered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share 
their views of how the case should be resolved.  Even if the USAO ultimately determined to 
proceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and 
concerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the 
process.  OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or 
considered before the NPA was signed.    
After the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the 
majority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.  
Although the evidence supports Villafaña’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that 
Epstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA 
was divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider how the 
desire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of 
the openness and fairness of the process.  As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed 
she had been “mistreated in the process.”  When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to 
avoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafaña, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have 
carefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did 
they revisit the decision before Villafaña met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or 
spoke to Edwards or other attorneys representing victims.446  Furthermore, more attention needed 
446  
It is not at all clear whether a court would have permitted impeachment of the victims concerning one 
provision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f) (“The 
admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of 
Evidence 410.”).  In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining 
monetary damages through either a civil suit or through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 (if Epstein were convicted after a trial),

282 
to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and 
timely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s 
communications with victims.447   
The decision not to inform victims and their attorneys about the existence of the NPA gave 
victims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel 
to keep the agreement secret from the victims.  Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA 
gave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the matter and 
undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement.  The overall result of 
the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and 
frustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.  
Although OPR credits Villafaña’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in 
dealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not 
prioritized by the USAO.  In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally 
handled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with 
victims and other witnesses.  However, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafaña also 
contributed to the problems.  The government, as it ultimately acknowledged in the CVRA 
litigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified 
fashion.         
OPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the 
CVRA.  In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar 
with its provisions.  OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above 
into account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to 
ensure that in the future, Department attorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever 
possible.448  For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO 
for communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO 
failed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving 
inconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.  In certain cases, such as the 
Epstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department 
components are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory 
messages.   
independent of the NPA provision.  OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have 
permitted the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement.  In other words, 
while the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the 
case agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to 
significantly damage the credibility of the victims was low.     
447  
In addition to the FBI letters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can 
be seen in letters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.  
Although OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the letters, it appears from the records 
OPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI letter stating that the case was under 
investigation while also providing them with a USAO letter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s 
state guilty plea. 
448  
OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2011 Guidelines.

CONCLUSION 
In November 2018, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about 
state and federal criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that 
Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States 
and foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm 
Beach, Florida estate.  The Miami Herald reported that in 2007, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that 
permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by 
pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s 
co-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.   
Following the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to 
investigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO 
improperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by 
negotiating and executing the NPA.  OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations 
stemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and 
law enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims.  In July 2008, a victim, later joined 
by a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition 
for enforcement of her rights under the CVRA.  In February 2019, the district court found that the 
government violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the 
NPA.  The court also found that letters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed, 
describing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components.  The records 
included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected and reviewed 
materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings, 
grand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available 
information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media 
reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case.  OPR conducted 
more than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI 
administrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former 
Department attorneys and senior managers; and the former State Attorney and Assistant State 
Attorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed or received written 
information from several victims and attorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and federal law enforcement.   
OPR identified the following five former USAO attorneys as subjects of its investigation 
based on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case 
through the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement:  former U.S. Attorney 
R. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Matthew I. Menchel, Andrew C. 
Lourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafaña.  Each subject submitted written responses detailing their 
involvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and 
decisions relating to victim notification and consultation.  OPR conducted extensive interviews of 
all five subjects.  The subjects also submitted comments on OPR’s draft report.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 309 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page55 of 217

284 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various 
decisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework.  OPR 
found that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through 
a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that 
set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA.  Although Acosta did 
not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knowledge of its terms.  
Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other 
subjects who implemented his decisions.  
Based on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit 
professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.  
Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject attorney 
intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at 
issue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on 
federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.  Furthermore, none 
of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.  
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.  Acosta’s decision to decline to 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not 
find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations.  Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one 
of Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution.  Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.  Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances.  In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 310 of 348
SA-310
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page56 of 217

285 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims.  The subjects did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into 
the NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation 
without a federal criminal charge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department 
did not interpret CVRA rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the 
federal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before 
criminal charges were brought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation 
was for the purpose of silencing victims.  Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series 
of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of 
the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is 
contradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims 
of a crime endure.  
 OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.  
Moreover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims.     
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights 
requirements.  Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.

Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page57 of 217

286 
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims’ attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct.  
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims.  Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      
After examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The 
overall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes 
that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.

METHODOLOGY 
A. 
Document Review 
As referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of 
thousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
Florida (USAO), other U.S. Attorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components, 
including the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive 
Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA).  The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their 
sources, are set forth below. 
1. 
USAO Records 
The USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein 
investigation and the CVRA litigation.  The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of 
material that Villafaña updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained 
pleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive 
compilations of internal and external correspondence, including letters and emails; evidence such 
as telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other 
confidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team 
handwritten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA, 
prosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.   
The USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material 
in the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set 
of Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein 
case collected by Sloman; Villafaña’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently 
retained official U.S. Attorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.   
2. 
EOUSA Records 
EOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional 
witnesses.  This information, dating back to 2005, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and 
saved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained.  EOUSA provided OPR with over 850,000 
Outlook records in total (not including email attachments or excluding duplicate records).  OPR 
identified key time periods and fully reviewed those records.  OPR applied search terms to the 
remainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.   
After reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records:  his inbox 
contained no emails from May 26, 2007, through November 2, 2008.  This gap, however, was not 
present with respect to Acosta’s sent email.  OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.  During its 
investigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data 
with an unrelated employee who had a similar name.  Once the data was properly associated, 
EOUSA found and produced 11,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2008, through the end of his 
tenure at the USAO.  However, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the 
emails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2008 and 2009, Outlook data for all U.S. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 204-3   Filed 04/16/21   Page 313 of 348

Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page59 of 217

288 
Attorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.  The USAO’s 
data was migrated between March and June 2008.    
EOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any 
additional emails.  OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the 
email gap.  Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knowledge of the problem, or that they or, 
to their knowledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails.  In addition, at 
OPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Attorney’s 
Offices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S. 
Attorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office.  OPR found no evidence 
indicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of 
concealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the 
result of a technological error.   
Although a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2007, through April 2, 2008, 
remained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this 
time due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email, 
which did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and 
witnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.   
3. 
Federal Bureau of Investigation Records 
OPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the 
Victim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein matter, to obtain relevant FBI documents.  
In addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation 
concerning its victim notification system.   
4. 
Criminal Division Records 
The Office of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with 
Outlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the 
USAO’s Epstein investigation.  The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, 
and saved emails, and calendar entries.   
CEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who 
worked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation.  The data included 
the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails.  CEOS also conducted a check of 
its shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.  
5. 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General Records  
OPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy 
Attorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the 
former Deputy Attorney General.  The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, 
and saved emails, and calendar entries.

289 
6. 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records 
related to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence, 
when the Department recused the USAO in August 2011 from “all matters, to include the 
investigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with 
minor females,” and assigned the matter to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for further consideration.  The records included a declination of the matter due to the NPA.  
7. 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records 
related to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.   
8. 
Public Records 
OPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records 
of the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Attorney’s Office for the 15th Judicial Circuit, 
and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court 
proceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.    
B. 
Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims 
1. 
Subjects 
OPR requested that all five subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement 
in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions 
relating to victim notification and consultation.  In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews 
of each subject under oath and before a court reporter.  Each subject was represented by counsel 
and had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.  The 
subjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.   
2. 
Witnesses 
OPR conducted more than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their 
supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel.  OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff 
and attorneys and current and former Department attorneys and senior managers, including former 
Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division Alice Fisher.  OPR also interviewed former State Attorney Barry Krischer and former 
Assistant State Attorney Lanna Behlolovick.   
3. 
Communications with Victims and Victims’ Attorneys  
OPR contacted attorneys known to represent 26 victims among the 30 surviving individuals 
who were identified in the USAO’s July 2008 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to 
include in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the 
U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.  OPR contacted the attorneys to invite

the victims to provide OPR with information regarding their contacts with, and notification 
received from, the FBI and USAO, during the period before the NPA was signed or before 
Epstein’s state plea hearing, about the status of the federal investigation, about Epstein’s state plea, 
or about the NPA.  OPR received information from or pertaining to 13 victims.

signature on this Agreement; and 
IT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that 
the interest of the United States and Epstein’s own interest and the interest of justice will be 
served by the following procedure;  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred in 
favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set out below.  
Should Epstein violate any of the conditions of this Agreement, the United States 
Attorney may at any time initiate prosecution against Epstein for any offense.  In this case, the 
United States Attorney will furnish Epstein with notice specifying the conditions of the 
Agreement which he has violated.  
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no prosecution for 
the offenses set out on page 1 of this Agreement will be instituted in this District, and the 
charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.  
Neither this Agreement nor any other document filed with the United States Attorney as 
part of this Agreement will be used against Epstein, except for impeachment purposes, in 
connection with any prosecution for the above-described offenses.  
Terms of the Agreement: 
1.
Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by
the State Attorney’s Office for the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm
Beach County (hereinafter, the “State Attorney’s Office”) charging
violations of the following Florida Statutes:
(a)
lewd and lascivious battery on a child, in violation of Fl. Stat.
800.04(4);
(b)
solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, in violation of Fl.
Stat. 796.03; and
(c)
engaging in sexual activity with minors at least sixteen years of
age, in violation of Fl. Stat. 794.05.
2.
Epstein and the State Attorney’s Office shall make a joint, binding
recommendation that Epstein serve at least two years in prison, without

3DJH 3 RI 4 
3.
Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State
Attorney’s Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and
sentence.
4.
Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal
investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not
contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein will not
contest that the identified victims are persons who, while minors, were
victims of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422
and/or 2423.
5.
The United States shall provide Epstein’s attorneys with a list of the
identified victims, which will not exceed forty, after Epstein has signed
this agreement and entered his guilty plea.  The United States shall make
a motion with the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida for the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the identified
victims and Epstein’s counsel may contact the identified victims through
that counsel.
6.
Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and be sentenced not later than
September 28, 2007, and shall begin service of his sentence not later than
October 15, 2007.
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is 
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach of 
any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement and to 
investigate and prosecute Epstein for any and all federal offenses. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that 
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.  Epstein further is 
aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court may 
dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting a charge to 
the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial.  Epstein hereby 
requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such 
prosecution.  Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to the 
date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be deemed 
to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such prosecution 
on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to a 
speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute of limitations for a 
period of months equal to the period between the signing of this agreement and the breach of this

agreement.  Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the Fifth Amendment 
and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that all felonies must be charged 
in an indictment presented to a grand jury.  Epstein hereby agrees and consents that, if a 
prosecution against him is instituted, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed by the 
United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and 
explained to him.  Epstein hereby states that he understands the conditions of this 
non-Prosecution Agreement and agrees to comply with them.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
United States of America,
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN)
OPINION & ORDER
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
Before the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 33, which the Government opposes.  See Maxwell Br., Jan. 19, 2022; Gov. 
Br., Feb. 2, 2022.  The Defendant seeks a new trial on the basis that Juror 50 “falsely answered a 
material question during voir dire and . . . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been 
subject to a challenge for cause.”  Maxwell Br. at 48.  The Defendant contends that the current 
paper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing.  Id.  In 
the alternative the Defendant requests an evidentiary hearing to inquire into Juror 50’s alleged 
nondisclosure.  She also argues a broader hearing is required based on a news article that
suggests a second juror was allegedly a victim of sexual abuse.  Id. at 49.  The Government urges 
this Court to deny the Defendant’s motion on the current record, but it consents to a limited
hearing on the issue of whether Juror 50 provided a materially false answer to Question 48 of the 
questionnaire.  Gov. Br. at 31–32.  
The Defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the current record is DENIED.  
Defendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 50 
regarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from considering 
under Rule 606.  With regard to Juror 50’s statements that do not pertain to jury deliberations, in 
2/24/22
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 1 of 21
SA-349
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page95 of 217

order to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn 
statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available 
on the current record.  
Accordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion.  The Court 
concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an 
evidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 50’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire.  The 
Court further concludes that Juror 50’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.  
Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets 
about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the 
accuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48.  Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial 
and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false 
statement during jury selection—has occurred.  To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that 
someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury.  Rather, it is the potential 
failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that 
material information so that any potential bias could be explored.  Conversely, the demanding 
standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 50’s use of social media nor 
the conduct of any other juror.  The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the 
Court will question Juror 50 under oath.  The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-
hearing discovery is DENIED. 
I. 
Background 
On December 29, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant 
guilty of five counts.  A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2022, the 
Government informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to

press outlets about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the matter.  Dkt. No. 568.  
The letter noted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror 
“described being a victim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the juror 
questionnaire and did not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse.  Id. at 
1.  The Government indicated in a redacted footnote that it believed the juror to be Juror 50, and 
a review of his questionnaire showed that he had provided a negative response to a question that 
asked whether a prospective juror had been a victim of sexual abuse.  Id. at 2 n.2.1  Finally, the 
Government requested that the Court offer court-appointed counsel to the juror in the event a 
hearing was ordered.  A letter from the Defendant followed shortly thereafter also informing the 
Court about the juror’s interviews.  Dkt. No. 569.  The Defendant filed a second letter that same 
day opposing the Government’s request “because based on undisputed, publicly available 
information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary hearing.”  Dkt. 
No. 570.2 
The Defendant filed a motion for a new trial on January 19, 2022.  The Government 
opposed the motion on February 2, 2022, and the Defendant filed a reply in support on February 
9, 2022.  In addition to Juror 50’s post-trial interviews, the Defendant’s motion relies on a New 
York Times article reporting that “a second juror described in an interview . . . having been 
The Government proposed redacting the footnote because the juror questionnaire was not a public document at that 
time.  Because (for the reasons explained below) the Court now unseals the questionnaire, that redaction is no longer 
necessary. 
For completeness of the record, the Court notes the following occurred also on January 5, 2022:  The Jury 
Department of the Southern District of New York received a call from Juror 50 asking for guidance because of 
statements he had given to certain media outlets that were being widely reported on in the press and inquiring 
whether he needed an attorney.  At the Court’s direction, the District Executive returned Juror 50’s call and 
informed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question.  Juror 50 then asked the 
District Executive if he could access his questionnaire.  The District Executive, again at the Court’s direction, 
informed Juror 50 that the questionnaire was not a public document and could not be provided to him.

sexually abused as a child” as a basis for a broader hearing beyond inquiry into Juror 50.  
Maxwell Br. at 21, 49.   
II. 
Motion for a new trial on the current record    
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the 
court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.”  Fed. 
R. Crim. P. 33(a).  The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s 
alleged nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984).  Maxwell Br. at 22–28; Gov. Br. at 11.  In McDonough, the 
Supreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror nondisclosure during voir dire, 
“a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir 
dire, and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a 
challenge for cause.”  McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 
32, 51 (2d Cir. 2021); United States v. Shaoul, 41 F.3d 811, 815–16 (2d Cir. 1994); United States 
v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1993).3 
The McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 606, which states: 
During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not 
testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s 
deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or 
any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court 
may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these 
matters. 
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1). 
The parties dispute certain contours of the McDonough test, including whether it requires a deliberately false 
answer.  But at a minimum, the parties agree that the deliberateness of a juror’s incorrect answer is relevant to this 
inquiry.  Maxwell Reply at 13–14.  Because, as explained below, the Court does not now resolve at this juncture 
whether Juror 50’s answers on the questionnaire and voir dire merit a new trial, it need not and does not resolve 
those disputes pre-hearing.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 4 of 21
SA-352
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page98 of 217

The Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for 
a hearing.  Maxwell Br. at 28.  But resolving the motion now would require the Court to accept 
as true Juror 50’s unsworn statements made to media outlets.  Moreover, in arguing for a new 
trial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from 
consideration by Rule 606.  E.g., Maxwell Br. at 12–14 (describing Juror 50’s statements in 
deliberation and other jurors’ reactions).  The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual 
conclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 50 deliberately 
lied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse.  See Maxwell Br. at 39–43.  
Finally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court 
granted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary 
hearing.  As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s 
impartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an 
evidentiary hearing generally should be held.”  United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 306 (2d 
Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).  The Court 
therefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record. 
III. 
Evidentiary hearing  
For the reasons outlined below, the Court determines that a hearing must be held 
regarding Juror 50’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.  
A. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing  
Because of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-
verdict inquiry is high.  A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when 
there is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative 
impropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.”  United States v. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 5 of 21
SA-353
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page99 of 217

Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 
1210, 1234 (2d Cir. 1983)).  Mere “[g]ossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.”  
United States v. Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).  Rather, “[a]llegations of 
impropriety must be ‘concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and 
relevant evidence.’”  Baker, 899 F.3d at 130 (quoting United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 540, 
543 (2d Cir. 1989)). 
The Defendant argues that this is the wrong standard.  Maxwell Reply, Feb. 9, 2022, at 8 
n.4.  But the Defendant does not identify an alternative standard.  And the Second Circuit has 
applied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough 
hearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire.  Stewart, 433 F.3d at 302–03.  
The Court is bound to apply this demanding standard. 
This high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for 
defendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.”  United States v. 
Ventura, No. 09-CR-1015 (JGK), 2014 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2014).  As the 
Second Circuit has repeatedly warned, “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: 
subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless 
applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”  
Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 119–20 (1987) (citing 
McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267–68 (1915)).  And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to 
afford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’”  Stewart, 433 
F.3d at 306 (quoting Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234).  
The Defendant argues that the considerations in Tanner and Ianniello are inapplicable to 
her motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 6 of 21
SA-354
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page100 of 217

deliberations.”  Maxwell Reply Br. at 8.  This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the 
[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.”  Ventura, 2014 WL 
259655, at *3.  And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new 
trial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.”  United 
States v. Guzman Loera, No. 09-CR-0466 (BMC), 2019 WL 2869081, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July 
3, 2019), aff’d, 24 F.4th 144 (2d Cir. 2022).  “[E]ven though there are additional 
considerations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon 
allegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule 
motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.”  Id. 
If a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to 
determine the facts with precision.”  Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544.  “Therefore, in the course of a 
post-verdict inquiry . . . , when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable 
grounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.”  Moon, 718 
F.2d at 1234.  The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony 
is needed.  Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544. 
B. The scope of the hearing  
The Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 50 provided false 
answers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and how Juror 50 would have 
responded to follow-up questions if accurate answers had been provided.  The Government 
acknowledges that Juror 50’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an 
evidentiary hearing under McDonough.  Gov. Br. at 33.  The Court agrees.  Question 48 asked 
jurors: 
Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual 
harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?  (This includes actual or attempted 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 7 of 21
SA-355
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page101 of 217

sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, 
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.) 
Dkt. No. 462 at 24.  In response to that question, Juror 50 checked the box for “No,” not the box 
for either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).”  But in several public statements 
made to media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The Independent and The Daily Mail 
dated January 5, 2022, Juror 50 stated that he was sexually abused as a minor.  The statements 
are direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 50 himself to multiple media outlets.  Moreover, the 
statements themselves describe Juror 50’s own experience.4  They constitute “clear, strong, 
substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has 
occurred,” and so warrant an evidentiary hearing.  Baker, 99 F.3d at 130. 
Although the Court does not decide whether the threshold to hold a hearing based on 
Question 25 alone has been met, because the Court will hold a hearing on Juror 50’s answer to 
Question 48 and because Question 48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire into 
Juror 50’s answer to Question 25.  Question 25 asked jurors: 
Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime? 
Dkt. No. 462 at 13.  Again, Juror 50 checked the box for “No,” and not the box for either “Yes 
(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).”  But Juror 50’s post-trial statements, if true, may 
describe criminal conduct of which he was the victim.  Therefore, Juror 50’s answer to Question 
is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will also inquire as to 
Question 25 at an evidentiary hearing.  See Baker, 99 F.3d at 130. 
The articles additionally state that Juror 50 shared this experience with the jury during deliberations.  The Court is 
prohibited by Rule 606 from considering that Juror 50 also told this information to the jury.  That Juror 50 revealed 
that he also disclosed this information to the jury does not prohibit the Court from considering Juror 50’s 
independent statements made to a reporter about his own experience. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 8 of 21
SA-356
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page102 of 217

The potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of 
sexual abuse may have served on the jury.  Rather, it is Juror 50’s potential failure to respond 
truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information 
so that any potential bias could be explored.  Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited 
in scope to Juror 50’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire. 
C. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 50’s social media 
The parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 50 
answered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire.  To the extent 
that the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 50’s answers to voir dire about his social media 
usage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high showing 
required.  See Baker, 899 F.3d at 130.  At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror 
stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I 
didn’t want to see anything regarding them.  So I am fully off of it right now.”  Nov. 16, 2021 Tr. 
at 133.  The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twitter?” to which Juror 50 replied 
“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”  
Id.   
The screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers 
implicate McDonough.  First, Juror 50 did not deny having a Twitter account.  Second, Juror 
50’s account had only 1 follower and followed only 39 people, which corroborates that his 
Twitter use was, at most, relatively minimal.  See Maxwell Br. at 17.  Third, the fact that Juror 
50’s Twitter account was opened in April 2021 and that he used it again in January 2022, after 
the completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 50’s answer that he deleted his social media 
accounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire.  The same is true of Juror 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 9 of 21
SA-357
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page103 of 217

50’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2022, after the completion of the 
trial.  Id. at 20.  And fourth, the screenshots proffered match Juror 50’s description of his social 
media accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”  Id.  The threshold for a 
hearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into 
Juror 50’s social media usage.  Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 
F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. 1978)). 
D. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors  
The Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 50 at an evidentiary hearing but also the 
other eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article 
published by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor.  Maxwell Br. at 21, 49–
50.  The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing 
as to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 50’s post-trial statements corroborate that another 
juror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations.  Maxwell Reply at 24.  As explained below, 
the evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the 
Court denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.5 
On December 31, 2021, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about 
being approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to 
remain anonymous.  Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers 
staff notified all jurors via email on December 30, 2021, about the development.  Subsequently, on January 5, 2022, 
a juror replied to the December 30 email sent by court staff.  In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news 
reports about the issue with Juror 50.  The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order 
on January 6, 2022.  The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice.  See 
Sealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. 13, 2022.  The Defendant now renews her request on the theory that the 
communications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times.  See 
Maxwell Br. at 21 n.10; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.12.  Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s 
communication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 50’s interviews are not 
relevant to the current inquiry.  Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal 
the concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror 
redacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment.  See Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 543.  The 
Court also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the 
parties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications.  The Court will file the unredacted 
communications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.    
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 10 of 21
SA-358
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page104 of 217

First, the news article upon which the Defendant relies does not warrant a hearing.  
Baker, 899 F.3d at 130.  The article includes a short, non-detailed mention of an anonymous 
juror.  As the Second Circuit recently held in affirming the denial of a hearing after a high-profile 
trial, “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made to a magazine 
reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence’” of 
misconduct that requires a hearing.  United States v. Guzman Loera, 24 F.4th 144, 161 (2d Cir. 
2022) (quoting Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234).  Another court in this circuit held that a New York 
Times article that, in a single sentence, alleged misconduct by an unidentified juror was 
insufficient to justify a hearing.  United States v. Bin Laden, No. S7R 98-CR-1023 (KTD), 2005 
WL 287404, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2005), aff’d sub nom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. 
Embassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2008) (“This single sentence, an unsworn snippet of 
hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn affidavits present in 
cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.”). 
Other courts have also concluded that unsworn, hearsay, and/or anonymous reports of 
juror misconduct are not the clear, strong, and nonspeculative evidence required for a hearing.  
See, e.g., King v. United States, 576 F.2d 432, 438 (2d Cir. 1978) (affirming the denial of a 
hearing where the defendant presented “weakly authenticated, vague, and speculative material as 
to one juror,” even where that juror was not anonymous); United States v. Wilbern, 484 F. Supp. 
3d 79, 87 (W.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding a “double hearsay” report of misconduct inadequate to 
justify a hearing); Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 438 (denying the defendant’s request for an 
evidentiary hearing where the defendant’s support, including post-trial media interviews, 
“amount[s] to little more than hearsay, speculation, and in one instance, vague allegations made 
by a person who refused to identify himself”).  Accordingly, the New York Times article is an 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 11 of 21
SA-359
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page105 of 217

insufficient basis for an evidentiary hearing, especially one that, according to the Defendant, 
would require the Court to “haul [11] jurors in after they have reached a verdict” to probe for 
who, if anyone, may have been mentioned in the article.  Guzman Loera, 24 F.4th at 161 
(quoting Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234). 
Second, Federal Rule of Evidence 606 bars the Court from considering Juror 50’s 
statements as evidence of another juror’s statements purportedly made during deliberations.  As 
previously quoted, the rule states: 
During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not 
testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s 
deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any 
juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not 
receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these matters. 
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1). 
Rule 606(b) is subject to three enumerated exceptions that permit a juror to testify about 
whether (A) “extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention”; 
(B) “an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror”; or (C) “a mistake was 
made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.”  Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(2).  In addition to these 
exceptions enumerated in the rule, the Supreme Court has held that Rule 606 “give[s] way” 
where “a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or 
animus to convict a criminal defendant.”  Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 137 S. Ct. 855, 863 
(2017).  Absent one of these circumstances, evidence within the ambit of Rule 606 may not be 
considered. 
Here, the Defendant relies on Juror 50’s statements of what another juror allegedly stated 
during deliberations.  That proffer is barred by Rule 606. 
In response, the Defendant argues that Juror 50’s statements about the second juror fall 
outside the scope of Rule 606 because she “does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 12 of 21
SA-360
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page106 of 217

content of deliberations” but instead to demonstrate that the second juror made a false statement 
during voir dire, like Juror 50 allegedly did.  Maxwell Br. at 50.  But this reading of Rule 606 
has been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this 
language is that “Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party 
seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.”  Warger v. Shauers, 
574 U.S. 40, 44 (2014).  The Defendant’s one-sentence attempt to dismiss Warger because it 
involved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing.  Maxwell Reply at 23 n.11.  It is the 
same rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here 
with equal force.  
The Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 606 does not bar Juror 
50’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an 
enumerated exception to the rule.  See Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(2)(A).  To the extent that argument is 
raised, it is meritless.  Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is, 
“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather 
than “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury 
room.”  Warger, 574 U.S. at 51 (cleaned up).  So, for example, the Supreme Court has held that a 
foreperson’s undisclosed experience with a car accident is not extraneous information, even in a 
motor-vehicle lawsuit where that failure to disclose could have supported a for-cause strike.  Id. 
at 42–43.  The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not 
provide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knowledge regarding” this 
particular case.  Id. at 51–52.  Rather, as this Court instructed, jurors are expected to bring their 
“reason, experience, and common sense” to bear in evaluating witnesses’ credibility and the

Defendant’s ultimate guilt.  Trial Tr. at 3066; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 
813, 818 (2d Cir. 1970). 
Last, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 606 does 
bar consideration of Juror 50’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms. 
Maxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.”  Maxwell 
Reply at 23.  The Court rejects this argument.  The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal 
defendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”  U.S. Const., amend. VI.    
The Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 50 is not a “witness[] 
against” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial.  Simply put, Juror 50’s testimony 
at the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 50 has engaged in any misconduct 
warranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime.  Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 
541 U.S. 36, 43 (2004) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s 
accusers” (emphasis added)).  Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 606’s 
prohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other 
exceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a 
long historical pedigree.  See Pena-Rodriguez, 137 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 606 to traditional 
English common law); Crawford, 541 U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is 
most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only 
those exceptions established at the time of the founding”). 
Next, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.  
The Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 606, 
explaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects 
of the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 14 of 21
SA-362
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page108 of 217

judge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate 
juror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by 
nonjuror evidence of misconduct.”  483 U.S. at 127; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 51 (“[A] 
party’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 606(b)’s removal of one means 
of ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”).  The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position.  There, the 
Supreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on 
racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that 
the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of 
the juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.”  137 S. Ct. at 869.  
Throughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical, 
constitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not attach to 
other forms of juror misconduct.  Id. at 868.  In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror 
with racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her 
consideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here.  Id. at 
869. 
Third, even if the Court did consider Juror 50’s statements about what another juror said 
during deliberations—which Rule 606 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do 
not meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, 
nonspeculative impropriety has occurred.”  Baker, 899 F.3d at 130.  According to an article in 
the Daily Mail, Juror 50 “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual 
abuse.”  That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not 
identify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.  It therefore falls 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 15 of 21
SA-363
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page109 of 217

short of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing.  See Bin Laden, 
2005 WL 287404, at *2.  Notably, this case is far from United States v. Colombo, where the 
Second Circuit ordered an evidentiary hearing on the basis of two sworn affidavits that identified 
another juror by name and described with particularity the alleged misconduct.  869 F.2d 149, 
151 (2d Cir. 1989). 
The Court therefore rejects the Defendant’s as-applied constitutional challenge to Rule 
606 and further concludes that Rule 606 bars the Court’s consideration of Juror 50’s statements 
about the second juror.  Even if the Court considered Juror 50’s statement about another juror, 
the evidence would be insufficient to meet the high threshold for an inquiry.  Without 
nonspeculative evidence of misconduct by any juror but Juror 50, the Court restricts the focus of 
the evidentiary hearing to Juror 50.  See Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544.6 
IV. 
The nature of the hearing 
A. The Court will examine the witnesses and the parties may submit questions 
In concluding that an inquiry into Juror 50’s conduct is warranted, the Court is mindful 
that the “object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible 
harm to other interests.”  Moten, 582 F.2d at 666.  Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s 
request that counsel directly question the juror—a decision committed to this Court’s “sound 
discretion.”  Id. at 667; see also Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544 (“We leave it to the district court’s 
discretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning the witnesses, 
and whether to hold the hearing in camera.”).  The Court will conduct the questioning at the 
The Defendant’s briefing is unclear as to whether she seeks to question the other 11 jurors only to identify the juror 
implicated by the news article, or if she would seek to question the other jurors in any event to determine “what 
Juror No. 50 said to the other jurors.”  See Maxwell Br. at 49.  To the extent the Defendant is requesting the ability 
to question jurors about what Juror 50 allegedly disclosed during deliberations, that request is denied as it is plainly 
foreclosed by Rule 606. See also Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 16 of 21
SA-364
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page110 of 217

public hearing with input from counsel.  The parties may submit questions consistent with this 
ruling, including what the Court holds in this Opinion are the limitations imposed by Rule 606 
and the appropriate scope of the hearing.  Once again, the scope of the inquiry is whether Juror 
50’s answers were false; if so, what is the explanation for the answers; and how Juror 50 would 
have responded to follow-up questions if accurate answers had been provided.  
Per this Court’s prior order, the parties must submit the proposed questions under 
temporary seal to ensure the integrity of the inquiry.  See Dkt. No. 596 at 4.  Proposed questions 
must be submitted via email on or before March 1, 2022.  The proposed questions will be 
unsealed following the hearing. 
B. The Defendant’s subpoena requests are denied 
The Defendant seeks two sets of subpoenas to conduct discovery in advance of the 
hearing.  Maxwell Br. at 48–49.  First, from Juror 50, the Defendant seeks any emails or other 
communications between Juror 50 and any alleged victim or witness; any other juror; any other 
person or media organization about Juror 50’s jury service; and, finally, any record of payments 
for any interview or information that Juror 50 gave about his jury service.  Second, from 
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms, the Defendant seeks 
all communications to and from Juror 50 regarding his jury service; all posts, comments, or 
photographs by Juror 50 regarding his jury service; and all documents reflecting when Juror 50 
opened or closed his accounts.  In her initial brief, the Defendant simply lists these requests 
without justification.  In her reply, she provides only a short rebuttal to the Government’s 
objections and does not explain why each request is relevant or proper. 
The Court denies these requests as vexatious, intrusive, unjustified, and a fishing 
expedition.  Given the focused inquiry the Court is ordering, the evidentiary hearing’s scope 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 17 of 21
SA-365
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page111 of 217

must be “limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.”  
Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544.  The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications 
between Juror 50 and unknown persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 50’s answers 
to the questionnaire and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire.  Nor has the Defendant 
explained why Juror 50’s receipt of financial payment for interviews after the trial, if true, would 
be probative of his inclination to not disclose at voir dire prior to trial.  The Court will not grant 
the Defendant “the opportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’”  Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234 
(quoting Moten, 582 F.2d at 667).   
Moreover, the Defendant’s requested subpoenas directed at social media companies who 
have custody of Juror 50’s communications, comments, and posts are procedurally improper.  
Those requests for social media content are subject to the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2701–11, which requires an additional factual showing for the Court to order disclosure, see 2 
Wayne LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure §§ 4.8(b), 4.8(d) (4th ed. 2021); Matter of Warrant to 
Search a Certain E-Mail Acct. Controlled & Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 829 F.3d 197, 206 
(2d Cir. 2016), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 1186 (2018).  And only the 
Government, not private parties like the Defendant, may request disclosure pursuant to the Act.  
United States v. Nix, 251 F. Supp. 3d 555, 559 (W.D.N.Y. 2017) (“[T]he [SCA] does not permit 
a defendant in a criminal case to subpoena the content of a Facebook or Instagram account.”); 
Facebook, Inc. v. Wint, 199 A.3d 625, 629 (D.C. 2019) (collecting cases).  Though the 
Government raised the Act in its briefing, the Defendant does not acknowledge it or purport to 
show she is entitled to make a request.  Accordingly, the requests as to the listed social media 
companies are denied.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 18 of 21
SA-366
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page112 of 217

The Court concludes that the Defendant has not made a showing that any pre-hearing 
discovery is appropriate, and the request to engage in an intrusive fishing expedition is denied. 
C. The Court will release Juror 50’s questionnaire  
This Court previously reserved ruling on Juror 50’s request that the Court release his jury 
questionnaire to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under seal to protect his 
supposed privacy interest.  See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.1.  The Defendant opposes both the unsealing 
and releasing the questionnaire to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will 
undoubt[edly] color Juror No. 50’s testimony and allow him to place himself in the best possible 
posture.”  Maxwell Br. at 53.  The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in 
limiting Juror 50’s access and opposes maintaining the questionnaire under seal.  Gov. Br. at 42; 
see also Dkt. No. 594. 
The Court will provide Juror 50 a copy of his completed questionnaire.  Unlike the 
parties’ proposed questions, Juror 50’s access to his completed questionnaire—the answers to 
which he wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry.  The Defendant’s concern that 
advance disclosure may somehow taint Juror 50’s testimony is unfounded.  See United States v. 
McCoy et al., No. 14-CR-6181 (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at 15 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2017) (providing 
the jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing).  Rather, delaying disclosure 
until the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.  
Moreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the 
questionnaire must be docketed.  Juror 50’s and the Defendant’s request that the questionnaire 
remain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  See Dkt. No. 596 at 2 (outlining the 
test).  First, the jury questionnaire easily qualifies as a judicial document.  It is a key exhibit to 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 620   Filed 02/25/22   Page 19 of 21
SA-367
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page113 of 217

the Defendant’s motion for a new trial.  Cf. Carbon Inv. Partners, LLC v. Bressler, No. 20-cv-
3617 (ER), 2020 WL 5441497, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2020).  Accordingly, a high 
presumption of access attaches.  For the reasons stated in this Court’s prior order, this 
presumption of access is not outweighed by the possibility of media interest in the document.  
See Dkt. No. 596 at 3.  Nor is sealing necessary to safeguard a possible hearing for the reasons 
stated above.  Finally, any privacy interest Juror 50 may have had in his questionnaire, see Press-
Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 464 U.S. 501, 511–12 (1984), has at least been greatly 
diminished, if not extinguished, since his public comments.  The Court further notes that 
prospective jurors had the opportunity to request that particular questionnaire answers remain 
confidential; Juror 50 did not make any such request.  Accordingly, Juror 50’s privacy interest in 
the questionnaire is now outweighed by the presumption of access.  Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119–
20.  The Defendant is accordingly ORDERED to docket Exhibit 1 to her motion for a new trial, 
Juror 50’s completed questionnaire.   
V. 
Conclusion  
For the reasons stated above, the Court will hold a hearing regarding Juror 50’s answers 
to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.  The public proceeding will take place on March 8, 
2022, at 10:00 a.m.  Juror 50 is hereby ORDERED to appear in Courtroom 906 of the Thurgood 
Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New York at that date and time 
to give testimony under oath in response to the Court’s questions.  Counsel for the Defendant 
and the Government are ORDERED to submit via email proposed questions in accordance with 
this Opinion & Order on or before March 1, 2022.   
SO ORDERED.

(In open court; case called) 
DEPUTY CLERK:  Counsel, please state your name for the
record starting with the government.
MS. MOE:  Good morning, your Honor.  Alison Moe, Lara
Pomerantz, Maurene Comey and Andrew Rohrbach for the
government.  We're joined at counsel table by paralegal
specialist Sunny Drescher.  Also as a member of our team in the
gallery are our case agents, Special Agent Amanda Young and
Detective and Paul Byrne.
THE COURT:  Good morning to you all.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Good morning.  Bobbi C. Sternheim and
Christian R. Everdell for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is present at
counsel table.
THE COURT:  Good morning, Counsel.
Good morning, Ms. Maxwell.   
Please, be seated everyone. 
We are here today for sentencing in United States v. 
Ghislaine Maxwell 20 CR 330.   
In preparation for today's proceeding, I have reviewed 
the probation report, which is dated June 9, 2022 by revision 
date.   
I have also received and reviewed the following 
additional submissions:  I have the defense memorandum in 
support of PSR objections, which is dated June 15, 2022.  I 
have the defendant's primary sentencing submission, which is 
SA-371

M6SQmax1                  
dated June 15, 2022.  There are exhibits attached to that 
sentencing submission, Exhibits A through J.  A through H -- 
I'm sorry -- A through I were a series of letters from friends 
and family members of Ms. Maxwell.  J is a forensic psychiatric 
evaluation.  And then I received by a later transmission date 
of June 26, 2022 a letter from an inmate at MDC related to 
Ms. Maxwell's assistance of other inmates with tutoring.   
I have the government's sentencing submission, which 
is dated June 22, 2022.   
With respect to victim impact statements, I have dated 
June 22, 2022 a victim impact statement from Annie Farmer.  I 
have a victim impact statement from the witness who went by the 
name of Kate under my pseudonym order during trial.  That I 
believe is undated.  I have a statement dated June 22, 2022 
from Virginia Roberts, or Giuffre.  I have same date from 
Juliette Bryant, same date from Maria Farmer, same date from 
Teresa Helm.  I also have undated statements from Sarah 
Ransome -- I apologize if I'm saying your name wrong -- and 
Elizabeth Stein. 
Counsel, is there anything else I should have in front 
of me for purposes of sentencing? 
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Ms. Sternheim.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Other than the submissions that we
made in connection with the CVRA, that is a complete record of
SA-372
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page118 of 217

what we have received and reviewed.
THE COURT:  Yes.  Thank you.  And that is part of the
record including there was an ethics letter and other materials
submitted in connection with your objection to that.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Thank you very much.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
All right.  Counsel, would you just please confirm 
that you've received each other's submissions? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Let's also confirm all submissions are
filed on ECF.
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, I did have the government indicate this in a 
letter, but if you would confirm and articulate what the 
government has done to notify any crime victims of their rights 
under the Justice For All Act? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
With respect to the six individuals who were proved at 
trial to be directly impacted by the offense conduct, the 
government has notified those individuals through their counsel 
about the sentencing and about their right to be heard.   
In addition to that notification, the government has

used the victim notification page on the U.S. Attorney's Office 
website regarding this case about the upcoming sentencing. 
THE COURT:  And you posted the Court's order there
regarding a process for submission of statements.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
We'll turn to the presentence report.   
Ms. Sternheim, I know that you have because you've 
objected to a lot which we will talk about, but for the record, 
have you read the presentence report and discussed it with your 
client? 
MS. STERNHEIM:  Yes, your Honor.
And, if I may, Mr. Everdell will handle the objections 
portion of our presentation. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll get to that in just a moment.
Thank you.
Ms. Maxwell, can you please confirm that you've read 
the presentence report and had a full opportunity to discuss it 
with your counsel? 
THE DEFENDANT:  I did have an opportunity to read it.
THE COURT:  And an opportunity to discuss it with your
counsel?
THE DEFENDANT:  I did.
THE COURT:  Okay.
Ms. Moe, for the record, have you reviewed the

presentence report? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
So we will turn first -- we'll set aside first the 
guideline calculation.  We'll turn to the factual accuracy of 
the report.  And I did receive substantial factual objections 
to factual assertions in the report.  I am prepared to go 
through those with respect to any continuing factual objections 
by the defense. 
Let me confirm, Ms. Moe, does the government have any 
objections to the report regarding factual accuracy? 
MS. MOE:  None, aside from those which are already
noted in the PSR.
THE COURT:  No continuing objections.
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Everdell, I know that you do have
continuing objections.  Tell me where you'd like to begin.
MR. EVERDELL:  Well, your Honor, I don't know if the
Court is planning on resolving each and every factual
discrepancy or dispute or whether there are certain ones that
the court will find are relevant to sentencing or whether we
should go through each in detail.
THE COURT:  I am prepared to -- what I typically do is
go through each one so that if there is a correction to the
report that is being requested to be made, whether it's

M6SQmax1                  
material to sentencing or not, I am prepared to address it.
So I believe the first -- what I see as your first 
continued objection is to paragraph 22. 
MR. EVERDELL:  I'm just getting my submissions.  
Yes, that's correct, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  I overrule the objection.  I do credit
Juan Alessi's testimony that the defendant identified and
targeted Virginia after seeing her in the Mar-a-Lago parking
lot.  The defendant also worked with Epstein to identify and
target Jane.
Paragraph three I see three objections to this 
paragraph.  Is that a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell? 
MR. EVERDELL:  Paragraph three, your Honor?
THE COURT:  23.  I apologize.
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  I overrule the objection.  The first
objection is regarding the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell was the
author of the essay in the paragraph.  I overrule the objection
because a reasonable inference supported by the trial evidence
is that the defendant authored the essay.  Metadata indicated
that the computer was registered to "GMax" and the document was
saved under the user name "Ghislaine."
The second objection is to the assertion that Epstein 
transferred Ms. Maxwell approximately $23 million during the 
conspiracy.  I overrule that objection.  Bank statements 
SA-376
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page122 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
admitted at trial showed that accounts under Epstein's name 
wired approximately $23 million over two occasions during the 
conspiracy to accounts of "Ghislaine Maxwell."  The defendant's 
assertion that Epstein's accountant may have had access to and 
control over these accounts does not undermine the reasonable 
inference that the defendant controlled the funds in accounts 
bearing her name, so that is established by a preponderance. 
As to the third objection that there's no evidence in 
the record that Epstein bought the defendant her New York City 
townhouse, I overrule that objection because I credit Kate's 
testimony that the defendant told her that Epstein bought the 
defendant her New York townhouse. 
Paragraph 25 is an objection to the characterization 
of the Palm Beach residence being operated through a culture of 
silence.   
You'll let me know if you're not maintaining an 
objection. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes.  I think that the default is we
are, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Understood.
I overrule this objection.  Evidence at trial 
indicates that this was the case.  For example, the household 
manual instructed employees to "see nothing, hear nothing, say 
nothing."  I credit Mr. Alessi's testimony that he understood 
this instruction to be a kind of warning that he was supposed 
SA-377
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page123 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
to be blind, deaf and dumb, and to say nothing of Epstein's and 
Ms. Maxwell's lives. 
Paragraph 26, there's an objection to the 
characterization concerning the defendant's identification and 
isolation of minor girls as inconsistent with the trial 
evidence.  I overrule this objection for the same reasons as 
articulated with respect to paragraph 22.  In addition, the 
trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein 
isolated girls by spending time with them alone away from their 
families.  For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to 
New Mexico.  Jane's testimony that she would spend time at the 
Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and the defendant. 
Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two 
objections:  First, to the assertion that the defendant and 
Epstein developed a scheme that created a "constant stream of 
girls who recruited each other."  And, second, she objects to 
the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other 
minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualized massages.   
Again, based on the trial testimony and evidence, I 
overrule the objection.  It supported the information in these 
paragraphs.  The evidence indicated the scheme started with the 
defendant's recruitment of Virginia.  Virginia then enlisted 
Carolyn in addition to at least two other girls.  Carolyn in 
turn recruited at least three friends, and those friends then 
brought more girls.   
SA-378
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page124 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
Carolyn credibly testified that she was paid twice as 
much when she brought friends to the massages.  Based on the 
defendant's control of household and Carolyn's testimony that 
the defendant on occasion paid her directly, I find it more 
probable than not by a preponderance of the evidence that 
Virginia was also paid more as encouragement to recruit 
additional girls. 
Paragraph 9, there's an objection to the inclusion of 
Kate in this paragraph.  It argues that her name should be 
deleted because Kate is not a victim of the crimes charged in 
the indictment. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I'm sorry to interrupt.  I
think you said paragraph 9.
THE COURT:  I did.  I'm sorry.  I'm skipping the first
number for some reason.  29.  Thank you, Mr. Everdell.
I overrule this objection because the paragraph 
doesn't assert that Kate was a statutory victim as we've 
discussed throughout trial and the government didn't contend 
that Kate was a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment, 
and that paragraph doesn't assert that she was. 
Paragraphs 30 to 38, there's objection throughout 
these to the characterization of the defendant having groomed 
Jane.  I overrule these objections.  I think the government is 
right here that the objection is conflating grooming with 
enticement to travel for purposes of sexual contact.  Jane's 
SA-379
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page125 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
credible trial testimony established that the defendant took 
steps to make Jane comfortable and encouraged her to engage in 
illegal sex acts with Epstein. 
Paragraphs 39 to 45 which describe specific conduct 
involving Kate, I think the specific request here -- well, 
first, was that it should be removed from the PSR because Kate 
was not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment, and 
then, alternatively, that it be moved to a different paragraph 
with a heading offense behavior not part of relevant conduct.  
I don't see that this is necessary.  I overrule the objection.  
Conduct involving Kate may be considered at sentencing her 
testimony revealed additional details of the defendant's method 
of identifying and introducing to Epstein young girls for 
sexualized massages.  Her testimony also established the 
defendant's knowledge of the sexualized nature of massages with 
Epstein. 
Paragraph 43, the defendant contends this paragraph 
should include a sentence that Kate was above the age of 
consent at all times.  I think the paragraph says that Kate was 
age 17 or above at all relevant times, and I have no objection 
to including that she was above the age of consent at all times 
based on the trial evidence, so I will make that change to 
paragraph 43 of the PSR. 
Paragraph 54, the defendant objects that there's no 
evidence that Epstein paid for Annie's trip to Thailand.  That

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
objection is overruled.  Annie testified to this fact at trial, 
and I credit this testimony. 
Paragraph 5 -- sorry -- did it again.  55, defendant 
makes three objections to the paragraph.  I overrule the 
objections.  The record supports that the defendant personally 
recruited Virginia to provide Epstein with sexualized massages 
when she was a minor.  Jane and Kate's testimony established 
that the defendant was aware that the massages were sexualized.  
I credit Mr. Alessi's testimony that the defendant approached 
Virginia, and that Virginia visited the residence -- approached 
Virginia for the first time, and that Virginia visited the 
residence later that day.  Flight records and credible witness 
testimony established that this meeting occurred before 
Virginia was 18.  In addition, when Virginia brought Carolyn to 
the residence, the defendant greeted them and instructed 
Virginia to show Carolyn -- quoting from the trial record -- 
"what to do."  Carolyn then witnessed Virginia give Epstein a 
sexualized massage involving sexual intercourse.  Finally, as I 
explained in my resolution to paragraphs 27 and 28, I do 
conclude that there is a sufficient basis to find by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant used monetary 
incentives to encourage Virginia to recruit Carolyn. 
Paragraph 58, the defendant objects to the assertion 
that Carolyn was 14 years old when Virginia brought her to 
Epstein's residence, claiming that Carolyn's recollection is 
SA-381
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page127 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
inconsistent and unreliable.  I overrule this objection.  
Carolyn testified at trial that Virginia first brought her to 
Epstein's residence when she was 14 years old.  I found Carolyn 
to be credible and credit her testimony.  I'm not persuaded by 
the arguments to the contrary.  Moreover, @Sean's credible 
testimony corroborated Carolyn's recollection. 
Paragraph 59, the defendant makes two objections.  
Same objection to Carolyn being 14.  For the reasons I've 
stated, that's overruled.  She objects to Carolyn's assertion 
that she visited Epstein's residence more than a hundred times.  
I overrule that objection.  Again, I credit Carolyn's 
testimony.  She testified that she went to the house "over 100 
times."  I reject the suggestion that this is improbable based 
on Epstein's travel schedule.   
Paragraphs 61 and 62 again object to Carolyn's age, 
and I overrule for the same reasons. 
Paragraph 64, three objections.  First, the defendant 
objects to Carolyn's assertion that she visited the Palm Beach 
residence over a hundred times and her assertion that she was 
14.  For the reasons I've given, I overrule those objections.  
She objects to the assertion that Carolyn stopped performing 
sexualized massages in 2001 when she was 18 years old and 
argues that the evidence indicates she was 17 years old.  We're 
going to take up the issue of this timing question with respect 
to the issue of which Guidelines Manual controls.  So I'll skip 
SA-382
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page128 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
that for now. 
Paragraph 72, defendant objects to the assertion that 
Epstein briefly penetrated Carolyn's vagina with his penis 
because her trial testimony the defense claims is contradicted 
by a 2009 deposition testimony.  I overrule this objection.  
Again, I credit Carolyn's testimony.  Carolyn plainly testified 
to this at trial.  
Paragraph 74, the defendant again objects to the 
assertion as to the age and timing.  Again, we'll pick up on 
that issue when we discuss the appropriate guideline manual. 
Paragraphs 75 and 76 the defendant objects to the 
inclusion of these paragraphs in the presentence report because 
the perjury counts have not been presented to a jury, and so 
she contends have no bearing on the sentence in this case.  I 
do overrule this objection.  A sentencing court's discretion is 
largely unlimited as to the kind of information it may 
consider.  It's free to consider evidence of uncharged crimes, 
dropped counts of an indictment, criminal activity resulting in 
acquittal in determining sentence.  United States v. Bennett, 
839 F.3d 153 (2d Cir. 2016).  I may consider the information as 
long as the information is reliable and accurate.  For the 
following reasons, I do conclude the information underlying the 
severed perjury charges is reliable.  The defendant testified 
under oath in 2016 that she was not aware of Epstein's scheme 
to recruit underage girls for sexual massages and other than 
SA-383
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page129 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
Virginia, was unaware if she had interacted with anyone under 
the age of 18 at Epstein's properties.  She never gave Annie 
Farmer a massage.  She was unaware whether Epstein possessed 
sex toys.  She was unaware that he was engaging in sexual 
activity with anyone other than her in the 1990s and 2000s.  
She never gave Epstein a massage.  The credible testimony and 
evidence admitted at trial disproves these assertions which 
were made under oath. 
Paragraph 79, the defendant objects to the 
characterization of the offense conduct as contrary to the 
trial record.  Here, defense hasn't provided any reason 
specifying this, and I don't see one.  So based on the written 
objection, it's overruled. 
Paragraph 81, the defendant objects to the assertion 
that Ms. Maxwell had direct responsibility for any sexualized 
massages that several women or any other people that Carolyn 
may have brought to Epstein's residence may have performed, and 
she contends there's no record that she interfaced with these 
individuals.  I am prepared to overrule that objection. 
The paragraph makes clear that these individuals did 
not interact directly with Ms. Maxwell.  Nevertheless, for the 
reasons explained a little while ago in overruling the 
objections to paragraphs 27 and 28, I do conclude that the 
evidence at trial established that the defendant's recruitment 
of Virginia set the recruitment scheme in motion that resulted 
SA-384

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
in the abuse of these individuals. 
Paragraph 82, the objection is to the assertion that 
the records recovered from the Palm Beach residence during the 
2005 search reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with 
sexualized massages between 2001 and 2004.  Again, I overrule 
the objection.  The trial record including message pads, phone 
book entries, and testimony of witnesses establishes by a 
preponderance that the information contained in this paragraph 
is accurate. 
Paragraph 83, so there was a revision here.  I'm not 
sure if there is a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell.  The 
previous objection was to the assertion that the defendant is 
responsible for the victimization of untold number of other 
victims.  The probation department adopted the government's 
suggestion, revised the paragraph to assert that the defendant 
is responsible for the victimization of additional minor 
victims.  To the extent there is a continuing objection, I 
overrule it for the reasons stated regarding paragraphs 27 and 
28. 
Paragraph 85 is an objection to the inclusion of 
Kate's victim impact statement and her status under the CVRA.  
We have litigated the question of Kate's ability to make a 
statement here.  I believe that defense's ultimate position was 
that with the requested redactions, there were no objections to 
her making a statement.  Do I have that right?

M6SQmax1                  
MR. EVERDELL:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  So I did reject the request for redactions
for the reasons explained in my order.  And as I explained in
overruling the objection to paragraphs 39 to 45, Kate's
testimony and her statement are relevant to sentencing which
I've indicated she may give.  And with that, there's objections
pertaining to fine and assets and the like.  I think we can
turn to those when we get to the fine.  Mr. Everdell, okay with
that?
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes, your Honor.  So we'll delay the
offense level calculation objections and the ones related to
the financial penalties for now?
THE COURT:  Yes, precisely, and we'll pick those up.
I think otherwise that's it for what I understand to be
continuing objections after probation responded to your
requests and assertions.  Agree with that, Mr. Everdell?
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, the only one that I would
highlight is there was an objection, I believe it's framed
according to paragraph 173, which deals with the financial
penalties.  The government made in their response some
representations that we take issue with, but if you're planning
on covering that later, we can reserve that till later because
it does deal with the financial penalties.
THE COURT:  Yes, I have objections to 172, 178, 192
and 193.

M6SQmax1                  
MR. EVERDELL:  I guess in the final version, it
probably pertains to 172.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
And with that, no further factual objections that need 
resolution, Mr. Everdell? 
MR. EVERDELL:  Other than the ones we've just
discussed, no, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  So, with those rulings, hearing no further
objections, with those rulings, I otherwise adopt the factual
recitations set forth in the PSR.  As in all cases, the PSR is
sealed and made a part of the record in this matter.  If an
appeal is taken, counsel on appeal may have access to the PSR
without further application to this court.
We'll turn now to the guideline calculation.  As 
counsel is aware, I am no longer required to follow the United 
States Sentencing Guidelines, but I am still required to 
consider the applicable guidelines in imposing sentence and 
must therefore accurately calculate the Sentencing Guideline 
range.  The parties dispute multiple aspects of the guideline 
calculation.   
Just to outline the relevant overall calculations, the 
defense contends that the correct guideline calculation is 51 
to 63 months' imprisonment.  The government contends that the 
SA-387
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page133 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
correct calculation is 360 to 660 months' imprisonment and 
argues that a guideline sentence is warranted. 
The probation department has calculated the range at 
292 to 365 months' imprisonment, but recommends a downward 
variance to a term of 240 months' imprisonment. 
Counsel, I have reviewed your written arguments 
carefully.  I have a few questions I want to ask, but I don't 
need to hear repetition of your written arguments, but I would 
be happy to give you an opportunity to add anything beyond your 
submission if you'd like to make any additional arguments.   
I'll hear from you now, Mr. Everdell. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Thank you, your Honor.  
I will largely rely on my written submissions.  I just 
would like to amplify one or two things.   
Your Honor, our initial argument, of course, is that 
the Court must resolve who is to make the determination about 
which book like -- when the offense conduct ended, which 
determines guidelines book applies: the 2003 or 2004 
guidelines.  We argue that that is a jury determination because 
the issue implicates the Ex Post Facto Clause.  So the 2003 
guidelines must apply because the jury was never asked to make 
that factual determination.   
I know your Honor is familiar with the arguments we 
raised.  I would just point out that the government in their 
response really did not engage with our arguments about the 
SA-388
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page134 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
issue of the Ex Post Facto Clause being implicated.  They want 
to cast this as purely a Sixth Amendment issue and cited cases 
along the Apprendi lines.  But this is an ex post facto issue 
properly framed.  This decision of when the offense conduct 
ended implicates whether or not an ex post facto violation will 
occur if the later guidelines is applied.   
Under the cases that we've cited, your Honor, we think 
that that is an issue for the jury to decide, and it is not 
really in the Apprendi line of cases.  It is focused on 
ex post facto law.  I just, for example, highlight for your 
Honor the Tykarsky opinion that we cited for the Court.  That 
is not an Apprendi decision.  That is not a Sixth Amendment 
decision.  In that case, there was an increase in the mandatory 
minimum that took effect potentially after the offense conduct 
ended.  It's interesting that at the time the law was that you 
could do that, a judge could make a finding and increase it as 
long as it didn't increase beyond the statutory maximum, so 
there was no Apprendi issue there.  That decision later got 
overruled by the Supreme Court, but at the time of Tykarsky, it 
clearly wasn't a Sixth Amendment Apprendi issue.  They resolved 
that issue on an ex post facto basis.  This decision about 
whether or not the offense conduct ended at a certain time, if 
it triggers an increase that implicates the ex post facto 
clause is a decision for the jury to make.  The government has 
not responded to that argument, and we think that that is a 
SA-389
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page135 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
persuasive -- along with the other sources and opinions we've 
cited, it's persuasive authority for the fact this is a jury 
decision, not a Court determination. 
THE COURT:  Are you leaving that argument?
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  We'll do a little back-and-forth so I have
everybody's arguments in mind.  Thank you.  
Go ahead, Ms. Moe.  
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.  
The government is confident the 2004 Manual applies in 
this case.  I believe we did engage with the ex post facto 
issue thoroughly in our brief.  The question is whether the 
factual record at trial establishes that the offense continued 
throughout the duration of 2004, which it emphatically did.  
The testimony of a crime victim who testified at this trial 
establishes that the offense conduct went past November 1, 
2004. 
THE COURT:  So I think the framing of the question
here is very important and its technical -- this whole
discussion is very technical.  It seems to me the question is
can the government point to a preponderance of the evidence
that conspiratorial conduct took place in this very small time
window, basically November and December 2004.  That is what's
in issue, and the question is what the trial record establishes
with respect to that two-month window.
SA-390
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page136 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
To some extent, the government points, I think, to 
post conspiracy conduct, and that concerns me.  And so I would 
like to ask you to draw my attention to what in the trial 
record specifically speaks to November and December of 2004. 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
As a threshold matter, the government's understanding 
that the case law is that the question is what is the end date 
of the conspiracy.  In other words, if the conspirators are 
taking actions periodically over time, the question is what is 
the last date of the conspiracy?  What does the trial evidence 
establish about the final date?  And here the trial evidence 
was that the conspiracy was ongoing through all of 2004 and 
into 2005. 
THE COURT:  But to make that point, I think you're
relying on post conspiracy evidence.
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  We're relying on evidence
that exceeds the date in the indictment, but it --
THE COURT:  It exceeds also the date of Carolyn's 18th
birthday.  And so it's not just what the indictment charges --
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  -- but by a conspiracy that is dependent
here on Carolyn being under 18 for its continuation.  And so
that's why I see what you're pointing to as post conspiracy,
not only because it goes past what the indictment charged, but
because I think legally you're pointing to non-conspiracy

evidence.
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  I think our point is that
the conspiracy was still live at the end of 2004, and we know
that because in fact the conspiracy was still ongoing beyond
that, and I don't mean to be --
THE COURT:  But, see, just in that sentence, the
conspiracy was going on beyond that, what you point to, I
think -- and tell me if I should look at something else, but
what you point to to make that argument is definitionally
non-conspiracy conduct.
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor, in part because -- well, to
step back and discuss the framing of the issue.  The question
is whether a conspiracy was still ongoing throughout 2004.  And
the key thought tells us it's the defendant's burden to show
that she withdraw from the conspiracy if it was ongoing.  The
question is in framing it, when did this conspiracy end.  We
know that it was still live as of the end of 2004, in fact,
because, among other reasons, Carolyn testified that she was
continually going to Epstein's house through age 17 and through
age 18, which would have been throughout the duration of 2004
and 2005.
The government is not required to show that any 
conspirator took an action in between those specific dates 
because the question is when did the conspiracy terminate?  Was 
it still live at the end of 2004?  And the evidence here shows 
SA-392
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page138 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
that it certainly was.  The message pads show that Carolyn was 
still going to the house.  Her testimony establishes that she 
was still going to the house throughout that time period.  We 
do not agree that we're required to show that any conspirator 
took a specific act in that exact window but just that the 
conspiracy was still live, and the fact that there were 
additional acts ratifying membership of the conspiracy 
throughout 2004 and into 2005 satisfies that burden. 
THE COURT:  Again, just to make sure I'm not missing
anything you want to point to, the into 2005 is pointing to
post conspiracy conduct.
MS. MOE:  Post indictment conduct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Post indictment.  Is it in some way not
post conspiracy?
MS. MOE:  Well, your Honor, again, the question before
the Court, according to the application is when the did offense
end.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, I do understand you're framing
that question.  I'm asking record evidence question.  Is there
something you're pointing to for your statement, the post 2005
which consists of conspiratorial conduct?
MS. MOE:  I think separate from the 2005 evidence, we
would point to in the fall of 2004, a message from Carolyn in
November of 2004 showing that she was contacting the house to
make a scheduled appointment.

M6SQmax1                  
THE COURT:  It's not dated November 2004; am I right?
It's on a page that has dates surrounding it of December,
November.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor, all of the dates
surrounding the message would be after November 1, 2004.  The
neighboring dates are November 13.  There's a date in December.
And I think looking at the message pads as a whole, it tells us
they're dated essentially sequentially.
THE COURT:  Is there any way to tell -- again, this is
very technical -- if it's October and November?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, I'd be happy to take a look at
physical book.  I just have the sheet in front of me to see the
page before and after, if the Court would like to examine it.
Our view is the combination of the message itself and the
neighboring dates tell us it's November of 2004.  In addition,
as we noted in our brief, the defendant was still traveling
with Epstein during this exact same time period.  Again, it's
the defendant's burden to establish withdrawal from an ongoing
conspiracy, which they've not attempted to do, nor could they.
We think that the message pads, the flight records, the fact
that the testimony of a crime victim Carolyn was that the
conspiracy was ongoing more than meets this burden.
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, if I could just respond to
that.  I do pick up on what the Court is saying, and we agree
SA-394
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page140 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
with the point, which is we're focusing on the record evidence.
The conspiracy as charged requires there be to be a minor
involved.  Carolyn is not a minor in 2005.  Her birthday is
January -- I don't know if I can say that, I'm sorry, but you
understand it's at the beginning.
THE COURT:  It's early.  
MR. EVERDELL:  It's early.  So as of 2005, she is not
a minor any more.  So if we're looking to the end date of the
conspiracy that's charged in the indictment, that does not
exist in 2005, and Carolyn is not a minor in 2005, that
evidence can't be used to support the end date of the
conspiracy that is charged.
So what we're really talking about is one message pad 
that is undated, unverified, and not even in evidence.  It's 
not even properly authenticated.  I would also point out -- 
it's not reliable, your Honor.  But I would also point out that 
I think we did have testimony that there were multiple message 
pads going on at any one time.  The surrounding message pads 
are not a perfect indicator of when that message would have 
been taken if it's undated.  It could have been weeks, months 
afterwards that someone decided to use that message pad to take 
that message instead of another of message pad that was ongoing 
at the same time.  So there is no reliable credible evidence 
that's the date of that message pad.   
And so, your Honor, we cited a number of cases in our 
SA-395
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page141 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
submission about the Court has to consider the weight and 
reliability of the evidence when determining a factor -- a 
sentencing factor that is going to increase the guidelines, 
especially by the amount that this is going to increase it by.  
And this one uncorroborated, unadmitted, unreliable message pad 
is not sufficient for that purpose.  So if we're relying on a 
factual record argument, there is not enough of evidence in the 
record to support that the conspiracy ended in November or 
December of 2004.  Therefore, the 2003 guidelines must apply. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  I have a question about the
leadership enhancement, as I said, but anything else you want
to raise that you didn't have the opportunity to raise in your
papers, Mr. Everdell?
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, just one point about that
same book issue.  I think there was a section of the
government's brief where they were trying to show -- this was
the point about the Court's discretion.  We argued the Court
has discretion to sentence as if it were the 2003 guidelines.
I realize that might not be where the Court is headed, but I
would point out --
THE COURT:  You mean as a variance argument.
MR. EVERDELL:  Exactly.  In that section, the
government made reference to an argument that the defendant was
receiving money into the 2007 time period.  I believe they
pointed to $7 million.  I think that is an extreme stretch,
SA-396
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page142 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
your Honor.  If the Court remembers the record evidence, there
was some evidence of money moving, but it was to buy a
helicopter that was not for her.  We heard testimony from Larry
Visoski that he often kept assets of cars in his name for
Mr. Epstein.  That doesn't make Larry Visoski a participant in
the criminal endeavors.  I think it's a stretch for the
government to point to that as some sort of evidence of
continued involvement or continued profit after the end date of
the conspiracy.  I just wanted to make that one point, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  Anything on that, Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, with respect to the financial
transaction, we offered that along with other evidence to
refute the claim that the defendant had moved on, which, as we
noted, is an expression that has no legal meaning.  And so
contrary to the assertion that the defendant had moved on and
was no longer associated with Epstein, the trial evidence
established that she remained a close associate for many years,
and that is the purpose for which we offered that evidence.
THE COURT:  Understood.  Thank you.
I do want to address -- do you have other -- I want to 
ask about 3(b)(1). 
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  I think it's for the government.  So as I
see the question here, the guidelines require me to find that
SA-397
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page143 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
the defendant was an organizer or leader, and that the criminal
activity either involved five or more participants or was
otherwise extensive.  The guidelines defines a participant as a
person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the
offense but need not have been convicted.
So I think my question for the government is, you're 
asking the Court to look to as a criminally responsible -- a 
person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the 
offense over whom Ms. Maxwell exercised supervisory or 
leadership role. 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  As we noted in our
briefing, our view is that the trial evidence establishes that
the defendant had a supervisory role over Sarah Kellen.  Here,
we're not required to establish that there were five or more
participants; that is, people who were criminally responsible
for the charged conduct, but rather that it was extensive, and
that the defendant supervised at least one other person.
That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the
Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged
with that from what we can tell, but on the factual question of
the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant
supervised another participant, it absolutely does.
THE COURT:  And the government is pointing to Sarah
Kellen for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be
one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.
SA-398
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page144 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Looking at the text of the
application note -- again, it's unclear from some case law on
this, but under the text of the application note, if we're
looking to one criminal participant, we would direct the
Court's attention to Sarah Kellen.
THE COURT:  And the leadership over her as opposed to
Epstein being the leader over her or them being -- Kellen sort
of replacing the defendant's role, could you focus my mind on
what specifically you point to to show supervision and
leadership by Ms. Maxwell over Ms. Kellen.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  
The trial evidence was that Sarah Kellen became an 
assistant, and that she worked for both Maxwell and Epstein.  
Essentially, when you look at defendant's role in earlier 
years, she was doing things like calling victims and arranging 
for massage appointments.  As the scheme shifted, they brought 
in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure 
and hierarchy of the scheme.  The defendant remained a close 
associate.  She was often traveling with them, often traveling 
with Kellen together.  So as Kellen took on some of the tasks 
that were then delegated to a lower member of the conspiracy, 
the defendant was higher up in the leadership structure.   
There wasn't direct evidence about, you know, the 
defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone 
call, and we acknowledge that, but we think the inference is 
SA-399
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page145 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
very clear that when you have two knowing conspirators, Maxwell 
and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an 
assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the 
defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the 
structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that 
she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that 
person; that she has control.  Even the simple task of 
directing her to take on some of those responsibilities, which, 
of course, to transition parts of that role she would have to 
do would qualify for leadership. 
THE COURT:  And there's clear time overlap in the
role?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  As we noted in our brief,
the flight records reflect that the defendant continued flying
on Epstein's private jet at the same time that Sarah Kellen was
also traveling, and that there was an overlap in the years of
the time period where they were all close associates of Jeffrey
Epstein and the scheme was ongoing.
THE COURT:  Go ahead.
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes.  Your Honor, before I address the
Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the
government seems to argue that there is some case law that is
not clear that you don't have to necessarily show that they're
supervising another criminal participant.  That's just wrong.
All those cases that the government cites, the issue has
SA-400
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page146 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
already been decided or conceded by the defendant.  The court
found they were leader or the defendant didn't contest that, so
the issue was only about whether the criminal activity was
otherwise extensive.  So that is not -- that is clear under
Second Circuit law, that they have to supervise another
criminal participant, and it's clear from the guidelines too,
as the government concedes.
Let's just talk a bit about Sarah Kellen.  I don't 
think it is a fair inference to say from the trial record that 
Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen.  In fact, the 
inference is exactly the opposite.  And you can rely on 
Carolyn's testimony alone for that; that she herself testified 
that there was a clear break between when she says that 
Ms. Maxwell was calling her to schedule for massage 
appointments versus when Sarah Kellen took over and scheduled 
for massage appointments.  They did not overlap.  There was a 
break.  That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said 
the same thing.  He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my 
employment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there, 
she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage 
appointments.  Again, a clear break.  
What the record shows is that there was a replacement.  
Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the 
trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing 
supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.  It couldn't be 
SA-401
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page147 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
clearer, your Honor, this notion that she was somehow -- Sarah 
Kellen was an assistant of both Epstein and Maxwell is again 
belied by the trial record.   
If you look at Larry Visoski's testimony, which I 
believe is what the government is relying on there, he 
originally testified, oh, I think she was an assistant for 
both.  But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really 
didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was 
that she was an assistant for Epstein.   
And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's 
testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she 
says unequivocally, "I was her assistant.  Kellen was Epstein's 
assistant."  So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was 
supervising Sarah Kellen.  The inference is exactly the 
opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership 
enhancement. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Anything further on the
enhancements for the government's objection?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, just very briefly with respect
to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's
attention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the
testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after
Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell
was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn
arrived for massage appointments.
SA-402

M6SQmax1                  
With respect to the testimony of the pilots who 
testified, whether they -- whether an employee was paid by 
Maxwell or Epstein or technically reported to one, according to 
their job descriptions, is not the question here.  The fact 
that pilots based on their observation thought at one point 
that Kellen reported to Maxwell proves the point that she had 
supervisory authority over Kellen and exercised it, whether in 
the chain of command or on their formal employment paperwork, 
she was just an employee for one or the other, it makes no 
difference.  There was an overlap here.  They had different 
roles in the conspiracy, and the defendant had a supervisory 
roll over Kellen. 
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, just to that point.  Being
present does not mean that you're a supervisor.  That's way too
far a stretch.  So the fact that there was testimony she was
present still in the house while Kellen was making the calls
and scheduling the massage appointments means nothing in terms
of supervisory authority.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Other enhancements before the
government's objection is to be addressed.
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, I assume you don't want to
hear or have any questions about the five-point enhancement for
repeated and dangerous sex offenders.
THE COURT:  I believe I have what I need, but as I

M6SQmax1                  
said, I don't need repetition of the arguments in the papers,
but if there is any additional points you want to make, you're
welcome to.  
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, just one point.  I will be
brief.  The government in its papers makes the argument that
the background commentary can't be relied upon as authoritative
because it is not explanatory or interpretative of what the
guideline is.  I think that is incorrect.
It is not simply a recitation of what Congress was 
considering.  That first sentence or two which talks about how 
this guideline can only be applied to offenders who represent a 
continuing danger to the community is interpretative of what 
the guideline is.  The title of the guideline is repeat and 
dangerous sex offenders.  That explanatory commentary explains 
how to interpret what dangerous means.  It means someone who is 
continuously dangerous to the community, not someone who's 
never been accused of a crime in the 18 plus years since the 
crime in this case, and has never been accused of re-offending.  
So I don't agree with that point.  This is authoritative 
guidance from the Sentencing Commission, and the Court should 
consider it as such.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, do you want to respond?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  We rest on our briefing on
this issue, but thank you.

MR. EVERDELL:  No, your Honor.  We rest on the papers.
THE COURT:  I thank you counsel for your thorough
briefing.  I am prepared to rule. 
The defendant raises four objections to the 
calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR.  As we 
discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2003 guidelines 
rather than the 2004 guidelines.  Beyond that, she objects to 
the application of three sentencing enhancements.  The 
government's sole objection to the calculation of the 
guidelines is that Virginia Roberts and Melissa should be 
considered victims.  So I will address the defense objections 
and then the government's objections. 
I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals 
apply.  Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of 
the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is 
sentenced.  18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).  But the 
Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced 
under Guidelines issued after she's committed her offense and 
the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the 
version in place at the time of the offense.  That's the 
principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 530 
(2013).  In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case 
of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at 
the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must 
apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was committed.

M6SQmax1                  
United States v. Guerrero, 910 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2018).  Here, 
the parties and the probation department agree that applying 
the current Guidelines would result in a significantly longer 
sentence than the application of the guidelines in place when 
the defendant committed her offense, whether that is the 2003 
or 2004 guidelines.    
The controlling date for ex post facto purposes is the 
last date of the offense of conviction.  The 2004 Guidelines 
became effective on November 1, 2004.  So I must determine if 
the last date of the offense was after November 1, 2004.   
Because it seeks an increased punishment, the 
government bears the burden of persuasion.  The government 
charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the 
indictment alleged ended in 2004.  It's proof at trial that the 
conspiracy continued in 2004 related to Carolyn.  And the 
charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2005 
because that's when Carolyn turned 18 and can no longer be 
deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged 
which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the 
age of 18.  So the government purports to carry its burden on 
this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some 
message pads regarding what occurred in 2004 and 2005.   
Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in 
my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn 
to be a credible witness, as did the jury.  The question before

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
me is specific and highly technical.  Does the preponderance of 
the evidence demonstrate that the offense to sex traffic 
Carolyn continued after November 1, 2004 before she turned 18 
in early 2005?  In other words, does a preponderance of the 
evidence establish that acts in furtherance of the conspiracy 
to traffic Carolyn occurred in either November or 
December 2004?  Although Carolyn testified regarding contact 
earlier in 2004 and after she turned 18 in 2005, there is no 
evidence, either in the form of testimony or documentary 
evidence, including the message pads, that demonstrates by a 
preponderance of the evidence conspiratorial conduct during 
those last two months of 2004 before Carolyn turned 18 in 2005.   
In those portions of Carolyn's testimony cited by the 
government, Carolyn stated that she was 18 years old the last 
time she went to Epstein's house, which would have been in 
2005.  As Carolyn further explained, she returned more than 
four or five times to Epstein after she gave birth to her son 
in March of 2004, and that testimony is supported by message 
pads entered at trial that show Carolyn called Epstein several 
times in the summer of 2004:  Once in late April or early May 
again on July 6, and again on July 30.  When she did return to 
Epstein, Carolyn testified Epstein asked if she had younger 
friends, and she explained during her testimony that at 18 
years old, she was too old for him.  Carolyn wasn't asked, and 
her testimony doesn't specifically address, whether she went to

Epstein's house after November 2004 before she turned 18.  
Message pads entered at trial show contact only before 
November 1.   
The government's reliance on two additional pads that 
were not entered into evidence doesn't change my analysis.  The 
first message GX-4B, it's undated, and the context does not 
give sufficient confidence that it came after November 1.  The 
other message pad is dated March 1, 2005, which falls outside 
the scope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment, and 
after Carolyn turned 18.  Because I cannot on this record find 
by a preponderance of the evidence that the offense continued 
during that two-month window after November 1, 2004, and before 
early 2005, I must apply the 2003 guidelines.  Because I find 
that the date of the offense was not after November 1, 2004, I 
do not address the defendant's alternative argument that a jury 
must decide if the 2004 Guidelines apply. 
Within the Guidelines themselves, the defendant 
objects to the application of three enhancements in the PSR.  
She takes issue first with 4B1.5(b).  The enhancement 
statements that the offense level is increased by five if:  
One, the offense of conviction is a covered sex crime; two,  
4B1.5(a) for prior convictions does not apply; three, the 
defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited 
sexual conduct.  All three requirements are met:  The defendant 
was convicted of a covered sex crime; she was not previously

M6SQmax1                  
convicted of a sex crime; and I readily find she engaged in a 
pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.  
Specifically, the Guidelines define a pattern of such activity 
as the defendant engaging in prohibited sexual conduct with a 
minor on at least two separate occasions.   
The defendant doesn't contest any of these enumerated 
requirements.  Rather, she argues that I may apply this 
enhancement only if I further find that the defendant poses a 
continuing danger to the public.  Here, the defense draws this 
requirement from background commentary by the Sentencing 
Commission and a few statements made by members of the Congress 
who of emphasized high recidivism rates in enhancing sentences 
for sex offenders.   
I overrule this objection because it lacks any basis 
in the Guidelines.  As with all interpretive matters, I start 
with the text of the Guidelines.  If the text is unambiguous, I 
apply it as written and do not resort to background commentary.  
United States v. Sash, 396 F.3d 515 (2d Cir. 2005).  Commentary 
cited by the defendant simply provides policy rationale for a 
particular enhancement.  It does not purport to interpret the 
Guidelines and so is not binding.  Nor can scattered 
legislative history override the clear text of the Guidelines, 
especially when that history amounts to only a few short floor 
statements which are "among the least illuminating forms of 
legislative history."  NLRB v. SW General, Inc. 137, S. Ct. 929 
SA-409
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page155 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
(2017).   
Moreover, the defendant fails to prove that 4B1.5(b) 
was enacted only to prevent future danger to the public.  
Background commentary explains that aside from recidivism, 
Congress "directed the Commission to ensure lengthy 
incarceration for offenders who engage in a pattern of activity 
involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of minors."  That's 
4B1.5 comment background. 
Further, the legislative history quoted by the 
defendant says that Congress increased Guidelines sentences for 
sexual abuse of minors "to address the egregiousness of these 
crimes."  And, in fact, the defendant's brief cites that I 
believe at 12.  Thus, I find no basis for a requirement that I 
must first find the defendant to be a public danger before 
applying the enhancement.  The defendant's remaining argument 
that applying this enhancement would result in an excessive 
sentence is appropriately considered as part of the defendant's 
request for a downward variance. 
Next the defendant objects to the application 
3B1.1(a), which we've discussed, which adds four offense levels 
for her leadership role in a criminal activity.  "a court must 
make two specific factual findings before it can properly 
enhance a defendant's offense level under 3B1.1(a): (i) that 
the defendant was an organizer or leader; and (ii) that the 
criminal activity involved five or more participants or was

M6SQmax1                  
otherwise extensive."  Quoting from United States v. Patasnik, 
F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 1996).  The Guidelines define a participant 
as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of 
the offense, but need not have been convicted.  That's Section 
3B1.1, comment note 1.  And in assessing whether criminal 
activity is extensive, all persons involved during the course 
of the entire offense are to be considered, including persons 
who provided services unknowingly.  Comment note 3.   
The defendant argues that she did not lead another 
criminal participant.  I overrule this objection because I do 
conclude that the government has proved by a preponderance that 
the defendant supervised Sarah Kellen, who was a knowing 
participant in the criminal conspiracy.   
Larry Visoski and David Rodgers both testified for 
that at least part of the time period at issue Sarah Kellen 
acted as a personal assistant to the defendant.  I credit that 
testimony which is corroborated by further testimony that the 
defendant was Epstein's number two and the lady of the house.  
At some point, Kellen took over some of the defendants duties.  
But even after that time, the defendant retained her leadership 
position, as evidenced by Carolyn's testimony, by flight 
records in evidence, and the household manual in evidence.  I 
do conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
defendant led a criminally responsible participant.   
I further find that the defendant's criminal activity 
SA-411
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page157 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
was extensive.  Whether criminal activity is extensive is based 
primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and 
noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the 
extensiveness of the activity.  District courts must determine 
the number of knowing participants in the criminal activity, 
the number of unknowing participants whose activities were 
organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal 
intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknowing 
participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal 
scheme.  For example, a taxi driver that drives a defendant to 
a crime scene would not count.  That is an example from a case 
called Carrozzella, 105 F.3d at 804.   
At all relevant times, the conspiracy proved at trial 
included at least two knowing participants:  Epstein and the 
defendant.  Beginning in 2002, Sarah Kellen joined, and 
beginning in approximately 2001, additional minor victims were 
recruited through Virginia and Carolyn.  Additionally, trial 
evidence established that services were unknowingly provided by 
various Epstein employees.  For example, I credit Juan Alessi's 
testimony that following the defendant's instructions, he 
scheduled massage appointments, set up the massage table for 
appointments, cleaned up after sexualized massages, and on at 
least one occasion drove Virginia to an appointment.   
Additionally, both Visoski and Rodgers were employed 
as Epstein's pilots over the same time period as the counts of 
SA-412
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page158 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
conviction.  Visoski testified that Maxwell partially owned the 
jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to 
fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself.  The evidence at 
trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the 
pilots fly victims of the conspiracy.  Across the timeframe of 
all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided 
personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the 
defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally 
available to the public.  Again, I'm citing from the 
Carrozzella case, 105 F.3d at 804. 
In addition to these unknowing participants that 
testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence 
that there were other unknowing persons led by Maxwell.  As 
Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous 
households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household 
staff.  The defendant had her own personal assistants, like 
Sarah Kellen and another individual.  From the record, I can't 
determine the precise number of these other individuals that 
unknowingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in their 
criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in the record 
that the number is sufficient to make the activity extensive 
within the meaning of 3B1.1(a) from 1994 to 2004.  See United 
States v. Archer, 671 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 2011). 
Last, the defendant objects to enhancement 
2G1.1(b)(4)(B).  That provision increases the offense level by 
SA-413
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page159 of 217

M6SQmax1                  
two if a participant unduly influenced a minor to engage in a 
commercial sex act.  In defining the enhancement, the 
Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of 
the case to determine whether a participant's influence over 
the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's 
behavior.  2G1.1, comment note 7.  And if the participant is at 
least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebuttable 
presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to 
engage in a commercial sex act.  I overrule the defendant's 
objection.   
The defendant first says the undue influence 
enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted 
in her base offense level.  Impermissible double counting 
occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the 
kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in 
the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at 
differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects 
different facets of the defendant's conduct.  United States v. 
Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2012).  There isn't double 
counting here.  The 2G1.1(a) base offense level reflects the 
aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex 
offense was a minor.  The enhancement, by contrast, reflects 
the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.  
I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition, 
including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App'x, 444 (2d 
SA-414
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page160 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••

M6SQmax1                  
Cir. 2021) (summary order).   Similar conclusion, United States 
v. Smith, a Ninth Circuit case from 2013, 719 F.3d 1120.  That 
case explains 2G1.3(a) base offense level and the undue 
influence enhancement "serve unique purposes under the 
Guidelines."  
The defense argues that because the enhancement 
applies only if undue influence was exerted with the aim of a 
commercial sex act, it does not apply here.  But the jury in 
Count Six did convict the defendant of sex trafficking Carolyn 
to participate in commercial sex acts.  The Court finds that 
Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was 
brought by Carolyn similarly were paid.  The remaining victims, 
including Jane and Annie, also testified that they received 
money and gifts during their abuse which satisfies the 
enhancement. 
The defendant argues Carolyn was not unduly influenced 
to sexually massage Epstein.  I find this argument meritless.  
The age gap between Carolyn and Epstein and the defendant far 
exceeded ten years, and the defendant does not rebut the 
resulting presumption of undue influence.  2G1.1, comment note 
7.  Carolyn testified she was paid to give Epstein sexualized 
massages, and she needed the money for her drug addiction.  
Later, Carolyn returned to Epstein because she needed the money 
for herself and her newborn son.  Plainly, taking advantage of 
a victim's financial need is a form of undue influence.  I'll

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
cite some cases for that proposition.  Watkins 667 F.3d at 265; 
United States v. Streb, 36 F.4th 782.  That's and Eighth 
Circuit case from 2022.  Courts have repeatedly concluded that 
a minor can be the victim of undue influence even if the minor 
initiates a sexual meeting.  See, for example, United States v. 
Lay, 583 F.3d 436 (6h Cir. 2009).  I therefore overrule the 
defendant's objection.   
I next turn to the government's only objection to the 
PSR Guideline calculation.  I do find that Virginia Roberts and 
Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were 
trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the 
charged period.  The Guidelines require that each minor victim 
be considered a separate count of conviction.  2G1.1.(d)1.  
Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this 
provision only because they were not named in the indictment.  
This is an incorrect basis for excluding them from the 
calculation.  Relying on commentary by the Commission, the 
Second Circuit has instructed "that conduct against victims 
other than those charged in the indictment may constitute 
relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be 
treated for sentencing purposes as though it occurred in a 
separate count of conviction."  I United States V. Wernick, 
691, F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing 2G1.1 comment note 4).  I 
therefore consider Virginia and Melissa as two additional 
groups of victims and assign each a unit under Section 3D1.4.   
SA-416
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page162 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
Having resolved the parties' objections, I will 
calculate the Guideline range.  As explained, I will use the 
2003 Guidelines manual.  Following Section 2G1.1(d)(1), each 
victim is considered a separate count of conviction.  In 
addition to the three victims for which an offense level was 
calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I 
calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a 
total of 5 groups.   
For all groups, the base offense level is 19.  That's 
Sections 2G1.1(a) and 2X1.1(a).   
For Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than 12 
but were not yet 16 when abuse began, the offense level is 
enhanced by 2.  2G1.1(b)(2)(B).   
The offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further 
enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a 
commercial sex act.  2G1.1(b)(4)(B).   
For Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least 
16, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were 
unduly influenced into a commercial act.  2G1.1.(b)(4)(B).   
The offense level for all groups are also enhanced by 
points because of the supervisory role in an extensive 
criminal activity.  3B1.1(a).   
This brings the total offense level for Jane's and 
Carolyn's groups to 27.  And Annie's, Virginia's and Melissa's 
groups each to 25.   
SA-417
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page163 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmax1                  
Because there are multiple counts, all within at least 
four offense levels of each other, I determine 5 units under 
3D1.4(a).  And under 3D1.4, 5 units increases the total offense 
level of the group with the highest total offense level by 5 
from 27 to 32.   
Last, because the defendant engaged in a pattern of 
activity involving prohibited sexual conduct, the total offense 
level is increased by 5 from 32 to 37.  4B1.5(b)(1). 
In conclusion, I find the correct total offense level 
under the 2003 Guidelines is 37.   
No party disputes the defendant's Criminal History 
Category of I.   
Under the 2003 Guidelines, a Criminal History Category 
of I and total offense level of 37, produces a guideline range 
of 210 to 262 months' imprisonment.   
The range for the fine, again, under the 2003 manual 
is $20,000 to $200,000 for each count.  That's 5E1.2(c)(3). 
The range for supervised release is three years to 
life.  5D1.2(a)(1) and (c) and 18 U.S.C. 3583(k), although I 
believe there is a -- yeah, I think that's supervised release. 
I don't want to hear repeated objections, but any 
objections based on anything I said that is new? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  With respect to the unit
analysis, we wanted to note that under 3D1.4, a total of 5
units adds 4 levels, not 5 levels.  I think the next layer on

the table is more than 5, as 5 levels.  And, thus, the total
number would be 36.

Mr. Everdell?

the government's response was the one added their request to
add Virginia and Melissa as separate groups, so we do object to
that.  I know the Court has already ruled on that.  We don't
think the record is adequate to make them separate offense
groups.  I understand the Court has already ruled on that, but
we would like to preserve that objection.

addressing the factual objections speak directly to this issue.
The record at trial amply established that Melissa and Virginia
were victims of this conspiracy, and that the defendant had
been involved with recruiting Virginia, who in turn recruited
Carolyn, who in turn recruited Melissa.
With respect to Melissa in particular, we would not 
that, like Virginia, her name appears in the defendant's little 
black book, noting that she's a friend of Carolyn's.  For all 
those reasons, and the reasons in our brief, we think the trial 
record amply establishes that they were both victims of the 
conspiracy. 
THE COURT:  I agree with that, and for the reasons
indicated, do -- I agree with the government's objection to the
probation calculation for that reason.
I think that means we don't need to resolve the 
factual objections that pertain to Carolyn's age.  As I said, I 
credit Carolyn's testimony.  The objections I would overrule 
because I think she accurately testified regarding her age both 
in 2004 and 2005, but it doesn't answer the question, as I see 
it, the legal question as to establishment of acts 
conspiratorial conduct in the relevant two-month period. 
With respect to fines, Mr. Everdell, what is now 
paragraph 172 of the revised report, the defendant objects to 
the inclusion a $10 million bequest from Epstein being included 
in her assets for purposes of determining her ability to pay a

fine.  I can't quite tell from the papers whether -- I know you 
say the bequest is likely to be contested.  What is the current 
status of the bequest?   
MR. EVERDELL:  Your Honor, my understanding is that
the document says what it says, and the estate is undergoing
bankruptcy proceedings.  I don't believe there is any -- this
issue has been addressed because I think the estate is still
dealing with victims' claims and other claims against the
estate.  But because it's in bankruptcy, I assume that this
will be contested, and we don't know if there will be any money
left at the end of that proceeding to honor the bequest.  So
that's one of the many reasons why I think this is such a
tenuous asset that it shouldn't be considered for purposes of
fines.
THE COURT:  It's listed as an asset in the financial
affidavit, is it not?  
MR. EVERDELL:  It is, your Honor, because we felt we
wanted to fully disclose everything we know about, and we do
know about simply because we were produced that document.  We
didn't know about it before.  We knew about it because we got
it in discovery, and we saw it was there, so we felt in good
faith, we had to list it or at least disclose it, but I don't
think it should be considered for purposes of fine.

information about the status of the estate.  With respect to
whether this information should be in the PSR, I think the
Court is exactly right.  This is listed on an asset on her
balance sheet.  Whether she ultimately recovers that amount or
not, it's listed in the same way that liabilities are listed
even though it may be uncertain as to how those are resolved.
So I don't think the objection is founded.
THE COURT:  Yes, I'm going to overrule this objection
to the PSR paragraph.  It is included as an asset in
Ms. Maxwell's financial aid affidavit.  The uncertain assertion
that she may lose the asset is not a basis to exclude it from a
considered asset for purposes of determining a fine.
Paragraph 178, the assertion here is that she is 
unable to pay a fine.   
Do I have that right, Mr. Everdell?  
MR. EVERDELL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  I overrule the objection.  Section
5E1.2(a) of the Guidelines requires the Court to impose a fine
in all cases except where the defendant establishes that she is
unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.
The defendant has failed to establish this.  As I just noted,
there is a $10 million bequest from Epstein this is in addition
to other assets noted in the PSR.
I will say the assets and finances have been a moving 
target.  In July 2020, Ms. Maxwell reported $3.8 million in

assets, and then reported $22 million in assets in support of 
the December 2020 bail application.  The claim now of an 
inability to pay the fine, as I understand it, at the same time 
in which the defense has not provided documentation of her 
marriage or the purported pending divorce settlement.  So I am 
unpersuaded based on the balance of facts that the defendant is 
indigent, and I do intend to impose a fine. 
I will address restitution at the end.  I understand 
the government is not seeking restitution.  So we will pick 
that up at the end. 
All right.  With that, I'm going to take a break, and 
then I will come back and hear from -- just fill a few 
formalities.  Neither of the papers make an argument for formal 
downward departures, as I understood them.  In any event, I've 
considered whether there's an appropriate basis for departure 
from the advisory range within the Guideline system and do not 
find any grounds warranting departure under the Guidelines. 
When we return with the Guideline calculation 
complete, I will hear from the parties as to what they contend 
a reasonable sentence is for Ms. Maxwell, taking into account 
the 3553(a) factors.   
It's 12:30, which is a shocking fact to me.  I suppose 
we should take a 30-minute break so that everyone can get 
lunch, as I imagine we still have a fair amount of matters to 
discuss and time to get through.  So we'll take a 30-minute

Ms. Moe 
MS. MOE:  With respect to the sequence of events, just
so victims are aware, would the Court prefer to hear from
victims before the Court hears from the parties or after?  We
defer to the Court, but it would be helpful to know for the
victims.
THE COURT:  I was anticipating government, victim
statements, defense counsel and then Ms. Maxwell if she wishes
to make a statement.  My staff did provide counsel for the
victims making statements an order in which they're speaking.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Any objection to that ordering, Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.

AFTERNOON SESSION  
1:10 p.m. 
THE COURT:  As I indicated, I'll hear first from the
government as to what a reasonable sentence is under the
3553(a) factors.
Ms. Moe, when you're ready. 
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.  May I take the
podium?
THE COURT:  You may.  Thank you.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, Ghislaine first met Jane at
summer camp in August of 1994.  Jane was 14 years old.  What
Maxwell did in the years that followed to Jane and Kate and
Annie and Virginia and Carolyn and Melissa, was almost
unspeakable, but the truth came out in this case; and while
many years have past, their pain is palpable, it's real, and it
matters.
Today we ask the Court to impose an above-guideline 
sentence of multiple decades in prison, a sentence that holds 
Maxwell accountable for the essential role she played in an 
extensive and disturbing child exploitation scheme. 
Maxwell trapped young girls in a horrifying nightmare.  
Her victims were vulnerable kids who found themselves alone in 
giant mansions where they were sexually exploited by adults 
they thought would help them.  These girls were just kids.  
They were just finding their way in the world, trying to figure 
SA-425

out who they were and who they might be some day when they grew 
up.  These kids had hopes and dreams for their future and the 
defendant used those dreams as her tool to abuse them. 
We ask the Court to take an unflinching look at the 
defendant's actions and consider what that tells you about who 
she really is.  What kind of person persuades young girls to 
massage the feet of a middle-aged man?  What kind of person 
gets a 16-year-old girl all alone at a ranch in the middle of 
nowhere and tells her to take off her clothes and get on a 
massage table so that she can grope that girl's chest?  What 
kind of person teaches a 14-year-old girl how a middle-aged man 
likes his penis to be touched?  What kind of person sees a 
17-year-old girl on the street and pulls over so that she can 
persuade that girl to come to a house of horrors where that 
young girl will be trafficked for sex?  What kind of person 
flies around on a plane with underage girls so that when her 
boyfriend travels, he always has a young girl to touch?  What 
kind of person would use their privilege, their power in this 
world to intentionally prey on the vulnerable, young girls from 
struggling families:  Girls without fathers, girls who needed 
help.  These are the actions of a person who was indifferent to 
the suffering of other human beings. 
The defendant's actions were not a one-time mistake; 
not at all.  Maxwell was an adult woman, and she made the 
choice, week in, week out for years to commit crimes with 
SA-426

M6SQmaxS1                
Jeffrey Epstein, to be his right hand, to make his crimes 
possible.  Those choices were hers, and they have to have 
serious consequences. 
What's more, her actions portrayed a disturbing view 
of the world we live in.  To Maxwell there were two kinds of 
people in this world:  The people who really mattered and the 
people who were disposable.  Maxwell wanted to make sure that 
she stayed among the people who she thought mattered.  She 
wanted to live a luxurious lifestyle jet-setting around the 
world.  She took millions of dollars from Epstein over the 
years and that's because they were predators together, they 
were partners in crime together, and they molested kids 
together. 
The defendant's actions had serious consequences for 
her victims.  These girls, now women, are strong.  They have 
shown the world what true bravery really is.  But when the 
defendant preyed on them, they were just kids, and they'll 
carry with them for their entire lives the trauma of what 
they've experienced.  What is truly remarkable about this case, 
your Honor, is that we don't have to speculate about the 
lasting irreparable harm that the defendant's actions have had.  
You have seen for yourself the devastating effects of the 
defendant's crimes and how much her actions have affected her 
victims even years later. 
The defendant has shown absolutely no remorse for her

crimes.  She has not owned up to the truth.  She has lied 
repeatedly.  She has been dishonest with the Court, and she has 
made misrepresentations when it suits her.  Your Honor, we 
recognize that the Court has calculated the guidelines to be 
188 to 235 months.  That is far below the sentence that the 
government believes is appropriate in this case.  We recognize 
that there are a small number of cases where the Court imposes 
an above-guideline sentence.  This is that case, your Honor.   
In the almost 20 years since the 2003 manual was 
enacted, our Sentencing Commission, our Congress, and our 
country have all recognized just how serious sex crimes against 
children are.  Our country now recognizes how woefully 
inadequate the 2003 guidelines were, and the Supreme Court has 
expressly held that sentencing courts can vary upwards for 
exactly that reason.  Again, this is that case.  This is 
exactly that case.  This is the time to impose an 
above-guideline sentence.  A guideline sentence in this case 
would create unwarranted sentencing disparities with 
individuals being sentenced today for sex-trafficking offenses.  
This case calls out for an above-guideline sentence because of 
the breathtaking scope of the defendant's conduct, the length 
of her crimes, the number of victims, the vulnerability of her 
victims, the sophistication of the defendant's predatory 
conduct and the degree to which she psychologically manipulated 
her victims.  Her conduct was shockingly predatory, and it

M6SQmaxS1                
calls out for an above-guideline sentence. 
We ask the Court to impose an above-guideline 
sentence, a sentence that sends a message that those who would 
conspire with sexual predators would be held responsible for 
their significant role in these crimes.  We ask the Court to 
send a message that nobody is above the law, and nobody is too 
rich or powerful to be held accountable.  We ask the Court to 
send a message that it is never too late for justice. 
Your Honor, you should not hesitate to hold the 
defendant accountable for the full measure of her crimes.  She 
deserves to spend decades in prison for her crimes.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Moe.
And I will ask that the individuals who are making 
statements come to the podium.   
Ms. Farmer is first.  You're welcome to remove the 
mask when you get there, Ms. Farmer, if you'd like.   
MS. FARMER:  Judge Nathan:  For a long time I wanted
to erase from my mind the crimes that Ghislaine Maxwell and
Jeffrey Epstein committed against me and pretend they hadn't
happened.  It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to
keep locked away.  But I've had to acknowledge the long-lasting
effects.  One of the most painful and ongoing impacts of
Maxwell's and Epstein's abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my
perceptions and my instincts.  When predators groom and then
abuse or exploit you, they are in a sense training you to
SA-429

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmaxS1                
distrust yourself.  When a boundary is crossed or an
expectation violated, you tell yourself, "Someone who cares
about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn't also be
trying to harm me."  This pattern of thinking is insidious, so
these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my sister
had also been harmed by them and came to find out years later
that many others had been exploited.
THE COURT:  Just a request to slow down.
MS. FARMER:  For years these memories triggered
significant self-recrimination, minimization and guilt.  I
blame myself for believing these predators actually wanted to
help me.  I felt tremendous survivor guilt when I heard about
what other girls and young women had experienced at hands of
Maxwell and Epstein.  I saw about how my sister's concern about
me weighed on her and felt guilty about this as well.
This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and 
exploited, feeling confused and naïve and blaming myself all 
resulted in significant shame; that sickening feeling that 
makes you want to disappear.  It was not constant but would 
come in waves, similar to the waves that anxiety would also 
show up.  When I think back, I see a slide-show of moments when 
these feelings would surface and overwhelm me.  There are too 
many of these moments to name and though I have come a long way 
in my path of healing, I know that these feelings will continue 
to be triggered at times.

            (212) 805-0300
M6SQmaxS1                
The ripple effects of trauma are undeniable.  When one 
person is abused, many others are also harmed.  In addition to 
the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I 
experienced as a sister due to how Maria was abused by Maxwell 
and Epstein and the harm caused to the rest of my family due to 
these events.  My sister Maria's abuse, the sexual assault, 
Maxwell's threats that stole her sense of safety and her 
career, the way they used her to get to me had devastating 
effects on her.  As my family watched her grow more isolated 
and more physically ill from the stress of all of it, we all 
felt powerless.  It was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we 
later learned how often this pattern was repeated.  A young 
person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in by 
Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try and 
piece together a life in the aftermath of this trauma that left 
them feeling distrustful and fearful.  Most of these 
individuals had families who also were negatively impacted as 
they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved 
one's losses and struggles.  The number of people harmed is 
impossible to measure.  Maxwell had many opportunities to come 
clean but instead continued to make choices that caused more 
harm.   
When my sister and I first spoke out to the media 
about what happened to us, Maxwell lied about us and threatened 
Maria, thus helping shut down investigations into their

behavior so they could together continue to harm children and 
young women.  After this attempt to alert people to Epstein and 
Maxwell's abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for 
two decades.  My shame told me I should hide this fact because 
it was embarrassing.  Later as I pursued my profession as a 
psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career.  I 
worried clients would not want to work with me if I was 
associated with this story, wrongly labeled as one of child 
prostitution.  I feared being on Epstein's and Maxwell's radar 
as a problem because of their previous lies and threats.   
Once arrested, Maxwell faced another choice.  She 
could admit her participation in this scheme, acknowledge the 
harm caused or even provide information that could have helped 
hold others accountable.  Instead, she chose again to lie about 
her behavior, causing additional harm to all of those she 
victimized.   
Judge Nathan, I hope when you consider the appropriate 
prison sentence for the role Maxwell played in this 
sex-trafficking operation, you take into account the ongoing 
suffering of the many women whom she abused and exploited as we 
will continue to live with the memories of the way she harmed 
us.  I hope you weigh the systemic effects of the crimes she 
perpetrated, the ways that our family members, romantic 
partners and friends have been hurt through our suffering.  I 
ask you to bear in mind how Maxwell's unwillingness to

acknowledge her crimes, her lack of remorse and her repeated 
lies about her victims created the need for many of us to 
engage in a long fight for justice that has felt like a black 
hole sucking in our precious time, energy and well-being for 
much too long now, things that cannot be replaced.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Farmer.
Kate may make a statement now. 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, before Kate speaks, I just
wanted to confirm that the Court's anonymity order, in
particular with respect to sketch artists, is in effect.
THE COURT:  Yes.  Consistent with the Court's prior
anonymity and pseudonym order, we will refer to this witness as
Kate only, and the sketch artists shall not draw an exact image
of Kate so that she can remain anonymous.  
Thank you, Ms. Moe.   
Kate, you may proceed.   
KATE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Thank you for
hearing me.  I believe you've already seen my victim impact
statement, so I have something else to say.
At a time when women's rights have so callously been 
discarded, as the mother a young daughter, I fear for the 
safety and freedom of my child.  Today offers hope that change 
is possible.  Our voices may not have been heard before, but we 
united to bring justice to a common enemy.  If we cannot stop 
women who have been raped from being forced to bear the

children of their rapists, then we must take a stand on zero 
tolerance to those who abuse their power to groom and traffic 
and rape the vulnerable.   
How you do anything is how you do everything.  Every 
single person should have equal value.  Every single person 
should have an equal right to be protected.  Every single child 
must have their innocence defended.  No person should be 
shielded from the consequences of their actions no matter their 
status or class.  Ghislaine's lack of remorse and her blatant 
refusal to take responsibility for her crimes towards us is the 
final insult.   
Having a difficult childhood is irrelevant to the 
choices she made to traffic and supply women/children to 
Jeffrey Epstein and other powerful men.  Despite the atrocities 
perpetrated on me, I have never recruited a child or any person 
to be sexually abused.  Someone being a hard worker does not 
excuse sex trafficking of minors.  Someone starting a 
non-profit does not excuse sex trafficking of minors.  Someone 
who had it difficult or even an abusive father does not excuse 
sex trafficking of minors.  Losing money and prestige does not 
excuse sex trafficking of minors.  The lack of remorse or 
responsibility taken by Ghislaine for how she ruined the lives 
of countless women and children is exactly how we can tell that 
she doesn't think what she did is wrong.  She is not sorry, and 
she would do it again.

I have known Ghislaine for many years now, and I have 
seen her be kind and generous to me and many others until she 
doesn't get what she wants from that person, and then I have 
seen her stop at nothing to enforce her will -- a manipulative 
cruel and merciless person who only uses kindness to manipulate 
and generosity to seek recognition.   
Today for the first time I stand with my sisters, 
bonded by a trauma that I wish on no one, to draw a line and to 
set a precedent to say enough is enough; to say no with a 
chorus of voices that you cannot ignore.  May that chorus ring 
through the ears of people still being victimized and give them 
strength.  May it echo in the ears of perpetrators to remind 
them that there are those of us who will never stop until we 
stop them.   
Today is not a happy day.  I take no pleasure in being 
part of a world where this is necessary, but I am proud to 
stand shoulder to shoulder with these brave women and do what 
is necessary to stop Ghislaine, to hold her accountable, and 
for the first time in my life not to feel afraid.  I could not 
have done this alone, and I thank those who walked alongside me 
and those who carried me.  Today I can look at Ghislaine and 
tell her that I became what I am today in spite of her and her 
efforts to make me feel powerless and insignificant, and I will 
pass that empowerment on to my daughter that she may never 
consider being silent when faced with injustice because she

VIRGINIA ROBERTS COUNSEL:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  
May it please the Court, this statement I am reading 
on behalf of my client, Virginia Giuffre, is written to 
Ghislaine Maxwell.   
Ghislaine:  22 years ago in the summer of 2000, you 
spotted me at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and you made a choice:  
You chose to follow me and procure me for Epstein.  Just hours 
later, you and he abused me together for the first time.  
Together you damaged me physically, mentally, sexually and 
emotionally.  Together you did unthinkable things that still 
have a corrosive impact on me to this day.   
I want to be clear about one thing:  Without question, 
Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible pedophile, but I never would 
have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you.  For me, and for so 
many others, you opened the door to hell, and then, Ghislaine, 
like a wolf in sheep's clothing, you used your femininity to 
betray us and you led us all through it.  When you did that, 
you changed the course of our lives forever.  You joked that 
you were like a new mother to us.  As a woman, I think you 
understood the damage that you were causing, the price you were 
making us victims pay.  You could have put an end to the rapes,

the molestation, the sickening manipulation that you arranged, 
witnessed and even took part in.  You could have called the 
authorities, and reported that you were part of something 
awful.   
I was young and naïve when we met, but you knew that.  
In fact, you were counting on it.  My life as a young person 
was just beginning.  You robbed me of that by exploiting my 
hopes and ambitions.  Ghislaine, the pain you have caused me is 
almost indescribable.  Because of your choices and the world 
you brought me into, I don't sleep.  Nightmares wake me at all 
hours.  In those dreams, I relive the awful things that you and 
others did to me and the things that you forced me to do.  
Those memories will never go away.   
I have trouble meeting new people without questioning 
if somehow they're going to hurt me too.  There is not a day 
that doesn't go by that I don't ask why.  Why did you enjoy 
hurting us so much?  I worry every single day and night that 
you will get away with it and evade being punished.  I will 
worry about that until you're brought to justice.  And what 
should that justice look like?  Ghislaine, you deserve to spend 
the rest of your life in prison in a jail cell.  You deserve to 
be trapped in a cage forever just like you trapped your 
victims.  But I want you to know that while you tried to break 
me, you did not succeed.  Despite you, I've grown into a woman 
who tries to do good in the world; a woman who on her best days

perpetrators like you continue to prey on the vulnerable, I 
will not stop standing up and speaking out.  Together with so 
many others you abused, we will do all we can to keep predators

I will never go away.  If you ever get out of prison, I will be

Malyshev.  She described him as a kind philanthropist who could 
help me get into FIT and provide much needed support.   
Over the next seven to eight months, I became against 
my will nothing more than a sex toy for the entertainment of 
Epstein, Maxwell and others.  I was subjected to sexual 
predation multiple times per day, both in his New York mansion 
and on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  On one 
of the visits to the island, the sexual demands, degradation 
and humiliation became so horrific that I tried to escape by 
attempting to jump off a cliff into shark-infested waters.   
Epstein and Maxwell were masters at finding young, 
vulnerable girls and young women to exploit.  Upon targeting a 
vulnerable girl/young woman, they would ingratiate themselves 
to her, giving her compliments and small gifts, telling her how 
special she was.  Soon after lulling me and others into a false 
sense of security and comfort, they pounced, ensnaring us in 
the upside-down, twisted world of rape, rape, rape.  Like Hotel 
California, you can check into the Epstein-Maxwell dungeon of 
sexual hell, but you could never leave.   
The manipulation, intimidation and emotional abuse 
used to control the victims took many forms.  In my case, 
Epstein and Maxwell used my dysfunctional family history, 
naivete, visa status, lack of education and desire to go to FIT 
to manipulate, scare and ensnare me.  They told me that I was 
exceptionally intelligent and that I had real potential to be

someone and something in life one day. 
Epstein's and Maxwell's strong ties to FIT could make 
this happen.  With their help, my admission was almost assured, 
but there was always a but.  First I had to write my 
application, which I did.  But Maxwell had to review it and 
conveniently always found fault.  Then another but, I needed to 
lose 30 pounds because I was a piglet.  Maxwell's numerous 
degrading descriptions of me.  Epstein and Maxwell put me on a 
strict Atkins diet while simultaneously sending me to a 
psychiatrist who prescribed antidepressants that caused weight 
gain.  It was a classic no-win situation, and they knew it:  
Precisely what human traffickers seek.  I never lost the 
weight, my application was never good enough, and it never got 
submitted. 
I thank the almighty God that in 2007, I managed to 
escape the horror by fleeing to the U.K.  Since then, I have 
been coping as best as I can and frequently experience 
flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares from 
reliving the awful experience.  I'm hypervigilant.  I do not 
trust people easily.  I experience dramatic mood changes.  I 
will sometimes start crying uncontrollably for reasons I cannot 
always comprehend.  I worked hard with several mental health 
professionals.  They have diagnosed me with extreme symptoms of 
anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, PTSD and tendency to 
self-harm.

Despite my earnest effort I have not realized life's 
true potential professionally, nor entered any healthy personal 
relationships.  I have never married, and I do not have 
children, something I always wished for when I was a little 
girl.  I shy away from meeting new people and have difficulty 
making new friends because I fear they too could be associated 
with Epstein and Maxwell and their enablers and 
co-conspirators.   
To this day I attend meetings to treat alcoholism, but 
I have had numerous relapses, and I cannot always control that.  
I know that only by the grace of God do I continue to live.  I 
have attempted suicide twice since the abuse -- both near 
fatal.   
Last year, I traveled to New York to attend Maxwell's 
trial.  It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four 
brave victim-witnesses, whose experience paralleled my own, to 
know that I was not alone, and that our story was finally being 
told for the world to hear.   
I am grateful the jury believed the victims and 
returned a guilty verdict, but a question still tears at my 
soul.  After all of this, how can this five-star general of 
this enormous sex-trafficking conspiracy involving hundreds, if 
not thousands, of vulnerable girls and young women over three 
decades continue to maintain her innocence?  Reflecting on it, 
I know the answer to my questions.

Maxwell is today the same woman I met almost 20 years 
ago, incapable of compassion and human common decency.  Because 
of her wealth, her social status and connections, she believes 
herself beyond reproach and above the law.  Sentencing her to 
the rest of her life in prison will not change her, but it will 
give the other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and 
help us as we continue to work to recover from the 
sex-trafficking hell she perpetrated.   
She will never ever hurt another young woman or child 
again in this lifetime, and for that I am sure.   
To Ghislaine, I say, you broke me in unfathomable 
ways, but you did not break my spirit, nor did you dampen my 
eternal flame that now burns brighter than ever before.   
Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Ransome.  I will hear the
statement from Ms. Stein.  
MS. STEIN:  Good afternoon, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon.
MS. STEIN:  I came to New York in 1991 at the age of
to attend FIT and immediately began to excel academically.
In my sophomore year, I accepted a Christmastime internship at
Henri Bendel New York.  I performed well and was asked to stay
on as a part-time employee.
In the fall semester of my senior year at FIT, 
Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store where she was a frequent

customer.  Her usual salesperson wasn't there, so I helped her.  
Ghislaine was electrifying.  We hit it off immediately.  In 
this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion, of 
difficult fathers and formal upbringing, of boyfriends and of 
how we both saw New York as a chance to start over.  She told 
me that her boss, who I later came to understand was Jeffrey 
Epstein, was close friends with Lex Wexner, the CEO and founder 
of The Limited, which owned Henri Bendel at the time.   
When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver 
them to her so she didn't have to carry them around all day.  
This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end 
clients.  Later that day, I called her office for delivery 
instructions and was told to bring them to a hotel close by to 
the store.  When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me 
Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted me to meet someone.  It 
was Jeffrey Epstein.  That night in the hotel was the first of 
many times they sexually assaulted me.   
Afterwards I tried to pretend everything was normal.  
I returned to my classes at FIT and continued to work at Henri 
Bendel, but I started to crack.  I failed a course that was 
necessary for my degree and had to retake it to get my diploma.  
Shortly after my first meeting with Epstein and Maxwell, I was 
offered a full-time position at Henri Bendel.  It was a newly 
created position at the store, and it would have required me to 
leave FIT a semester short of completing my degree.  I had

aspirations of going to law school, and I knew I could not do 
so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.   
When Ghislaine found out, she flew into a rage.  I 
didn't understand why until she told me that she and Epstein 
were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in 
turning it down I was being ungrateful.  I now know that this 
was their standard operating procedure.  Give a gift or a favor 
and then demand sex in return.  Nevertheless, I completed my 
course work, got my degree from FIT, at which point I left 
Henri Bendel and took a position at Bloomingdales.  I wanted to 
leave Epstein and Maxwell and the abuse they perpetrated 
against me behind as I started my professional life.  I never 
wanted to or expected to see them again.   
One day in the fall of 1995, Maxwell showed up at 
Bloomingdales looking for me.  When I asked her how she knew 
where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel.  
She immediately began befriending me once again, asking me to 
go out socially.  I tried to resist but eventually she wore me 
down, and I began spending time with them again.  They made me 
feel like they were friends, contemporaries.   
In one instance, they took me to Florida and insisted 
that I stay longer than planned which caused me to miss work 
and led to me being fired.  Seizing on this new vulnerability 
they began trafficking me to their friends.  By that time I was 
trapped.  I was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times

in New York and Florida during a three-year period.  Things 
happened that were so traumatizing that to this day I am unable 
to speak about them.  I don't even have the vocabulary to 
describe them.  In the most literal sense of the word, Epstein 
and Maxwell terrified me.  They told me that if I told anyone, 
no one would believe me; and if they did, they would kill me 
and the people closest to me.  I believed them.   
I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind.  I loved 
life and people genuinely enjoyed being around me.  After 
meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it felt like 
someone shut off the lights to my soul.  My secrets became too 
much for me to handle, and I began doing whatever I could to 
try to get away from Maxwell and Epstein.  I changed jobs, 
apartments, cities and even states to try to get away.  
Everywhere I went, they found me.   
In 1997 I moved to Philadelphia with the hopes of 
finally starting law school.  They found me again, and it was 
more than I could take.  I was hospitalized with a nervous 
breakdown.  It would be the first of over two dozen 
hospitalizations in a decade following my involvement with 
Epstein and Maxwell.   
In addition to my escalating mental health problems, I 
began to experience physical symptoms that doctors could never 
quite put their fingers on.  I could no longer even pretend to 
be able to hold down a job or take care of myself in any

meaningful way, and I had to move back home once again.  
Emotionally, I had cracked and nobody thought I would ever get 
better, but I didn't give up.  I was determined to do whatever 
I had to to prove everyone wrong.  I wasn't crazy.  I was hurt.   
For over a decade and a half, I went to all kinds of 
medical specialists and was in and out of medical and 
psychiatric hospitals, having tests and procedures, even 
submitting to clinical trials and an experimental implantable 
medical device.  Nothing helped.   
Just as I began to repair the emotional damage, I was 
diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome.  CRPS is a rare 
neuro-inflammatory disorder characterized raised by intense 
relentless physical pain.  Both CRPS and PTSD are 
psychophysical states in which the sympathetic nervous system 
is engaged and remains inappropriately hyperaroused.  There is 
no cure.  The mind and body are interconnected.  Despite of 
this, I immersed myself this trauma therapy and repaired my 
emotional health.  I began physical therapy and regained my 
physical mobility.  I started to rebuild my life.   
The arrest of Epstein in 2019 and Maxwell in 2020 
helped me immensely.  For the first time, I was finally able to 
disclose their abuse to friends and medical providers.  25 
years after meeting them my experience was validated.  I could 
finally see the possibility of closure.  This past November and 
December I commuted almost every day from my home in

Philadelphia to attend Ghislaine Maxwell's trial in Manhattan.  
For weeks I sat in this courtroom anonymously, only revealing 
my identity the day before the verdict.  I had to see justice 
myself.   
At the age of 48, I feel as if I'm just starting my 
life.  All those things I assumed I would have in life, the 
things that my siblings and my friends have achieved:  A 
career, success, partner, family, a home, a legacy to be proud 
of leaving behind were jeopardized for more than two and a half 
decades.  The only pronounced difference between my life 
experience and theirs is that one day when I was doing my job, 
I met Ghislaine Maxwell who fed me to Jeffrey Epstein.

to me became my decades-long, full-time career.  In that, I
have been successful.  
For the past 25 years, Ghislaine Maxwell has been free 
to live a life of wealth and privilege that is almost 
incomprehensible.  Meanwhile, I have had virtually none of the 
life experiences I might have had we never met.  For over two 
and a half decades, I felt like I was in prison.  She has had

MS. STERNHEIM:  I am going to speak as best as I can.
I want to acknowledge the courage that all of you have
exhibited in coming forward at the trial and again today.  Your
statements are immensely powerful.  We feel the pain.  We can
only hope that the end of this case and the sentence to be
imposed will give you some solace and the sanctity that you
have the ability to move forward and beyond all of this.
Judge Nathan, can you hear me?  I didn't pull it out,
I hope.
THE COURT:  I can.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Okay.
You have heard all of the trial testimony and you are
fully familiar with the record.  We will refrain from pointing
out many statements that we disagree with by the government
that we believe stretches the elasticity of the record well
beyond what we believe is fair inference.  But the purpose of
today is not to take issue with the record; that will be
addressed to the Court of Appeals.
The government asks the Court to sentence Ms. Maxwell
above the more reasonable guideline range that the Court
determined is applicable in this case and seeks a sentence of
multiple decades in prison for a woman who is almost 61 years
old and for almost the last 20 years has not engaged in any
conduct similar to that which was the subject of the trial and

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
the conviction.
The government has asked for an immense sentence.  We
recognize that any sentence in this case is going to be
significant and is going to be immensely punishing.  The
probation department, based on the original guidelines in the
presentence report, recommended a downward variance to 20
years.  That recommendation is now higher than the guideline
range that is applicable in this case.  But we ask the Court to
consider the justification that probation articulated in the
presentence report in fashioning a sentence that takes into
consideration that a sentence lower than the guideline range is
appropriate in this case.
The government's sentence asks for the outer limits,
and although we still believe that even the recommendation is
too high, a sentence within the guideline range now may be more
reasonable, but it still does not take into consideration some
of the various factors that we have brought to the Court's
attention in our submission.  Simply stated, based upon the
conduct of conviction, the government's request is out of
proportion.  Jeffrey Epstein would have faced the same
sentence, and he is clearly far more culpable than Ghislaine
Maxwell.
THE COURT:  You mean he would have faced the same
guidelines.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Yes, that is correct, Judge.

M6s2Max2                  
The sentencing submissions, which I know the Court has
read——and I know the Court reads everything very critically and
carefully——outlines and details our position, and I am not
going to take the time to repeat those things unless the Court
requests me to answer certain questions.  
But in fashioning the appropriate sentence for this 
case and this defendant, the Court needs to take into 
consideration the various 3553(a) factors that the Court must 
take into consideration in every case regardless of what the 
crime of conviction is. 
I know that what we heard today does not beg sympathy
for Ms. Maxwell, but there are circumstances in her life that
bear attention by the Court in imposing a reasonable sentence
in this case.  She has lived the entirety of her life under
giant clouds that have cast very dark shadows.  The tragic
accident of her eldest brother within 72 hours of her birth on
Christmas Day left him in a coma for seven years, until he
died, an event that impacted her family to this day and
overshadowed infant Ghislaine's entry into the world and her
early childhood.  Her narcissistic, brutish, and punitive
father overwhelmed her adolescence and early adulthood.  And
the controlling, demanding, manipulative Jeffrey Epstein cast a
deceptive shadow over Ghislaine's adulthood, the repercussions
of which will plague her until her last breath.  And like the
past two years of intense presentence incarceration, which was

M6s2Max2                  
unusually harsh and punishing, she will remain in the shadow of
prison bars until she can return to the sunlight of liberty.
As I said before, she is over 60 years old.  She has
no history of violence.  She had no criminal history before or
after the crimes of conviction, which ended some 20 years ago,
and the Court needs to consider that there is an extensive
period that has elapsed from the end of the charged conduct.
She poses no danger to society or of recidivism.  Her personal
circumstances include many accomplishments and good deeds.  
As I said, she has been subjected to extensive 
punishing conditions of presentence incarceration in solitary 
confinement.  When she was moved within the last two months to 
general population, she began interacting with the inmates and 
assisting them in many, many ways.  She began conducting 
English classes and GED tutoring, programs that were no longer 
being offered in the MDC and certainly had been suspended as a 
result of the ongoing pandemic.  Her asset to the unit in 
general population is recited in the unsolicited letter 
submitted to the Court from one of her fellow unit inmates.  
But I have also been contacted personally by counsel for other 
inmates in Ms. Maxwell's unit, reporting to me that she is 
providing needed educational assistance that has not been 
ongoing for at least two years. 
Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced for terrible conduct.
There is no denying that.  But she has the ability and the

desire to be law-abiding, which she has exhibited, and to do
good.  Before the charged offense and for the better part of
the past 20 years, she has demonstrated that she is not a
danger to anyone.  A sentence below the applicable guidelines
is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, punishment for
Ghislaine Maxwell.  The Court should not send her away for the
rest of her life.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Sternheim.
Ms. Maxwell, you have the right to make a statement.  
You are not obligated to do so, but if you would like to, you 
may do so now.

Your Honor, it is hard for me to address the Court
after listening to the pain and anguish expressed in the
statements made here today.  The terrible impact on the lives
of so many women is difficult to hear and even more difficult
to absorb, both in its scale and in its extent.  I want to
acknowledge their suffering and empathize.  I empathize deeply
with all of the victims in this case.
I also acknowledge that I have been convicted of
helping Jeffrey Epstein commit these crimes.  And despite the
many helpful and positive things I have done in my life, and
will continue to do, to assist others during my sentence, I
know that my association with Epstein and this case will
forever and permanently stain me.
It is the greatest regret of my life that I ever met
Jeffrey Epstein.  I have had plenty of time to think, having
spent two years in solitary confinement.  I believe that
Jeffrey Epstein was a manipulative, cunning, and controlling
man who lived a profoundly compartmentalized life and fooled
all of those in his orbit.
Variously, his victims considered him as a godfather,
a mentor, benefactor, friend, lover.  It is absolutely
unfathomable today to think that that is how he was viewed
contemporaneously.
His impact on all those who were close to him has been
devastating, and today those who knew him even briefly, or

never met him but were associated with someone who did, have
lost relationships, have lost jobs, and have had their lives
completely derailed.
Jeffrey Epstein should have been here before all of
you.  He should have stood before you all those years ago.  He
should have stood before you in 2005, again in 2009, and again
in 2019, all of the many times he was accused, charged, and
prosecuted.
But today it is not about Epstein ultimately.  It is
for me to be sentenced and for the victims to address me, and
me alone, in this court.  
To you, all the victims, those who came in court and 
to those outside, I am sorry for the pain that you experienced.  
I hope that my conviction, along with my harsh and unusual 
incarceration, brings you closure.  I hope this brings the 
women who have suffered some measure -- I hope that this brings 
the women who have suffered some measure of peace and finality 
to help you put the experiences of those many years ago in a 
place that allows you to look forward and not back. 
I also acknowledge the pain this case has brought to
those that I love, the many I held and still hold close, which
tortures me every single day, and the relationships that I have
lost and will never be able to regain.
It is my sincerest wish to all those in this courtroom
and to all those outside this courtroom that this day brings a

terrible chapter to the end, to an end.  And to those of you
who spoke here today and to those of you who did not, may this
day help you travel from darkness into the light.
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Maxwell.
Counsel, is there anything else -- I'm sorry, let
me -- I do want to ask defense counsel, before I get there, if
there are any objections to any of the conditions recommended
by the Probation Department with respect to supervised release.
MS. STERNHEIM:  No, Judge.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And I understand the government is
not -- I just want to talk about restitution before I get to
the statement of judgment.
Count Six is mandatory restitution, but the
government's position is that no restitution should be ordered
because all victims have been compensated.
MS. MOE:  That is correct, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Counsel, is there anything else I should
consider or any reason why sentence should not be imposed at
this time?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
MS. STERNHEIM:  No.
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me gather my thoughts for
one moment.

THE COURT:  Thank you for your patience.
As I have stated, the guideline range applicable to
this case is 188 to 235 months' imprisonment.
Under the Supreme Court's decision in a case called
Booker and related cases, the guideline range is only one
factor that the Court must consider in deciding the appropriate
sentence.  I am also required to consider the other factors set
forth in a provision called 18 U.S.C. 3553(a).  These include
the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history
and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence
imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote
respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the
offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to
protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, to
provide needed educational, vocational training, medical care,
or other treatment.  I am to take into account the kinds of
sentences available, as I have said, the guideline range, any
pertinent policy statement, the need to avoid unwarranted
sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who
have been found guilty of similar conduct, the need to provide
restitution as appropriate under the law to any victims of the
offense.
I am required to impose a sentence sufficient, but no
greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes I have just
described.  I have given substantial thought and attention to
SA-457
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page203 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
the appropriate sentence in this case in light of the 3553(a)
factors and the appropriate purposes of sentencing as reflected
in that statute.  
The crimes for which I sentence Ms. Maxwell today are 
the crimes for which a jury convicted her of committing 
following trial.  I do want to emphasize that today the 
sentence is based entirely on those crimes and the harm done to 
the victims of those charged and proved crimes.  The evidence 
at trial established that Ms. Maxwell directly and repeatedly 
and over the course of many years participated in a horrific 
scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some 
as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.   
I will pause on those words for a moment, "by and with 
Epstein."  It is important at the outset to emphasize that 
although Epstein was, of course, central to this criminal 
scheme, Ms. Maxwell is not being punished in place of Epstein 
or as a proxy for Epstein.  Like every other participant in a 
multi-defendant case, Ms. Maxwell is being punished for the 
role that she played in the criminal conduct.  As to that role, 
the trial evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was 
instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls and that 
she herself participated in some of the abuse, and it is her 
conduct for which she has been convicted in the court under the 
laws of this country and it is her conduct for which she must 
be held accountable.

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
Turning to that conduct, the punishment here must
reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the
law, provide just punishment for the offense, and deter.
First, as to the seriousness, the defendant's conduct
was, as aptly described by the probation department, heinous
and predatory.  Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein to select young
victims who were vulnerable.  Once selected, Ms. Maxwell played
a pivotal role in facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls
through a series of deceptive tactics.  A sophisticated adult
woman, she provided an initial venire of responsibility and
even safety.  She befriended and developed relationships of
trust.  She then manipulated the victims and normalized sexual
abuse through her involvement, encouragement, and instruction.  
To give one example from trial, Jane testified that 
Ms. Maxwell cultivated a friendship with her, took her to 
movies and shopping.  In an initial sexual interaction, while 
Jane was 14 years old, the defendant engaged in sexual conduct 
with Epstein while Jane was present.  After that, the defendant 
instructed Jane, again, while she was only 14 years old, on how 
to massage Epstein, including instructions on how to touch his 
penis during massages.  The abuse later escalated to Epstein 
using vibrators on Jane, penetrating her with his fingers.  
During some of the sexual abuse, the defendant would herself 
touch Jane's breasts.   
Carolyn, the victim of the sex trafficking charge, 
SA-459
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page205 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
provides another example.  She testified that she confided in 
the defendant that her mother was an alcohol and that she had 
been raped and molested by her grandfather starting at a very 
young age.  The defendant, aware of this knowledge, used it to 
subject Carolyn to a continuing cycle of sexual abuse.  The 
defendant wasn't an impassive observer, but herself touched 
Carolyn's breasts, again, at the time Carolyn was 14.  For 
years, Carolyn was paid for the sexualized massages, including 
personally paid by the defendant. 
Similar patterns of conduct were described by other
witnesses.  Indeed, the criminal conduct established at trial
was extensive and it was far-reaching.  Ms. Maxwell and Epstein
victimized multiple underaged girls using this pattern, this
playbook, over the span of many years and in a variety of
locations.  And the damage done to these young girls was
incalculable.  They did bravely testify at trial about what
happened to them despite the extraordinary difficulty that
entailed.  They withstood cross-examination from zealous
defense counsel and testified credibly at trial about the
trauma that they had endured and the painful, horrific, and
lasting impact of that trauma.  They did so, they told me in
their statements, in order to help ensure justice for
themselves and others and to do what they could to try to
prevent other girls from suffering in the future as they had
suffered.

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
The sentence I impose must reflect the gravity of
Ms. Maxwell's conduct, of Ms. Maxwell's offense, the pivotal
role she played in facilitating the offense, and the
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.  So, too, must the
sentence promote respect for the law, provide just punishment,
and afford adequate deterrence.  
As I have described, this scheme was long-lasting, it 
was far-reaching, it was horribly damaging to the victims.  
Just punishment and promotion of respect for the law, it 
demands a substantial sentence that meets the scope of the 
conduct and the scope of the harm. 
Moreover, general deterrence is critically important
to the sentence I will impose.  A substantial sentence will
send an unmistakable message that those who engage in and
facilitate the sexual abuse and trafficking of underaged
victims will be held accountable by the law.
As the probation department stated, a significant
sentence should promote general deterrence against the
exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this
offense, and I fully agree.  But let me be clear that
Ms. Maxwell is wealthy or that this case is high profile is not
a basis for increasing punishment in any regard, but the rule
of law demands, and this Court must ensure that, whether you
are rich or poor, powerful or entirely unknown, nobody is above
the law.  That message serves the important interest in
SA-461
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page207 of 217

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.•••
            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
deterrence and just punishment as well.  All of these factors
suggest that a very serious, a very significant sentence is
necessary to achieve the purposes of punishment that I have
just described.  
Of course I must, and I do, take into account the 
history and characteristics of the defendant.  Ms. Maxwell is 
over 60 years old.  This is her first conviction.  Neither in 
arguing for pretrial detention nor with respect to sentencing 
has the government contended that Ms. Maxwell represents a 
continuing danger to the public.  As I explained, I do not need 
to find she is a continuing danger to apply 4B1.5(b), as her 
decade-long pattern of predatory activity amply justifies that 
enhancement and a substantial sentence, but her present lack of 
dangerousness is a factor in my consideration of a proper 
sentence.   
Her sentencing submission letters and psychological 
report discuss the impacts of an overbearing and demanding 
father and the tragic death of her brother at the beginning of 
her life.  The record indicates that she has engaged in some 
charitable works, including environmental conservation and 
health-related charitable organizing and giving.  The set of 
letters I received from her family members and friends describe 
her as attentive and loving to her family and a loyal and 
generous friend.  A letter from an inmate describes her 
tutoring of other inmates while incarcerated and Ms. Sternheim 
SA-462
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page208 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
represents that she has heard similarly from other defense 
counsel.  I take all of these factors into account consistent 
with the 3553(a) statutory provision when deciding what 
sentence to impose.   
Beyond these factors, much of the defense written 
submission, not the oral statement today, but much of the 
written submission focused on a series of complaints about 
Ms. Maxwell's pretrial detention.  As I have said in many 
sentencing proceedings since the pandemic began, the conditions 
in the MDC have been extremely difficult for all inmates as a 
result.  There have been extended periods of lockdown, health 
risks, and the lack of access to legal and social visits and 
programming and the like.  Conditions at the MDC are, to put it 
mildly, not what they should be, and serving time during the 
pandemic has been more difficult than serving time before it.  
As I have in other sentencings, I take into account this in 
imposing an appropriate sentence.  I also take into account 
that, as a high-profile defendant charged and convict of sex 
offenses against minors, Ms. Maxwell faces security risks and 
has endured additional isolation and surveillance beyond the 
typical pretrial detainee.   
That said, I largely reject the defense's primary 
written contention that Ms. Maxwell has been singled out for 
uniquely harsh and punishing treatment.  To the contrary, I 
agree with the government that many of the complaints have been 
SA-463
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page209 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
unfounded and exaggerated and that Ms. Maxwell's treatment at 
MDC was overall as good as or better than that of the typical 
pretrial detainee at the MDC during the pandemic. 
I also reject the repeated allegations that
Ms. Maxwell, who was provided extensive access to computers and
legal materials, as well as to highly involved counsel, was in
any way not able to prepare for trial or sentencing.  I will
say that I think a lack of full candor regarding treatment is
consistent with a lack of candor to Pretrial Services and to
the Court regarding finances, as well as the dishonesty that I
have concluded occurred during the civil deposition that makes
up the perjury counts.  Overall, the behavior appears
consistent with a pattern of deflection of blame.
I will note that I was -- I would emphasize that the
sentencing submission talks about these complaints and blames
others but did not express remorse or acceptance of
responsibility.  Ms. Sternheim and Ms. Maxwell today
acknowledge the courage of the victims who testified and who
spoke, talked about the pain and anguish that they have
expressed, to some extent acknowledged the impact on them and
their suffering, and I think that is important for the victims
to hear.  What there wasn't expressed was acceptance of
responsibility.  Now let me be clear.  Ms. Maxwell is fully
entitled to exercise her constitutional -- was fully entitled
and is fully entitled to exercise her constitutional right to
SA-464
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page210 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
go to trial.  She has every right to appeal that verdict.  But
it is appropriate for this Court, in the face of genuine
expressions of remorse and acceptance of responsibility, to
decrease punishment because that's part of the message that's
being sent by the law.  It's appropriate to note and to take
into account a lack of acceptance of responsibility, a lack of
expression of remorse as to her own conduct.  Today's sentence
will attempt to acknowledge the harm that Ms. Maxwell caused
and it will strongly and unequivocally condemn her criminal
conduct.
I do conclude, consistent with the Probation
Department recommendation, that a sentence of 240 months, which
is slightly above the guideline range that I found, is both
sufficient and necessary -- and no greater than necessary to
meet the purposes of punishment that I have described.
I will now formally state the sentence I intend to
impose.  I will ask Ms. Maxwell and her counsel to please rise.
Ms. Maxwell, it is the judgment of this Court that you
be sentenced to a period of 240 months, 20 years, to be
followed by a period of five years' supervised release.
You may be seated.
To be precise, I am sentencing Ms. Maxwell to 60
months on Count Three, 120 months on Count Four, and 240 months
on Count Six, all to run concurrently, for a total of 240
months' imprisonment.  I am sentencing her to three years of
SA-465
Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page211 of 217

            (212) 805-0300
M6s2Max2                  
supervised release on Counts Three and Four and five years on
Count Six, all to run concurrently, for a total of five years
of supervised release.
Defense counsel indicated no objection to the
conditions of supervised release indicated in the presentence
report, and so I impose them precisely as stated in the
presentence report, including the standard conditions, special
conditions, and mandatory conditions of supervised release.
Again, I am imposing them precisely as stated in the PSR.
I order Ms. Maxwell to pay a fine in the amount of
$750,000.  The maximum amount per count is $250,000, so that is
$750,000 total.  As I have indicated, I reject the contention
that the defendant is unable to pay a fine.  Ms. Maxwell has
received a $10 million bequest from Epstein.  This is in
addition to her other assets.  And the defendant, I conclude,
is able to afford a substantial fine, and I conclude that the
maximum amount per count is reasonable under all relevant
circumstances in light of the counts of conviction.
The government has indicated that it is not seeking
restitution nor forfeiture.  
I am imposing a mandatory special assessment, as I 
must, of $100 per count, which is due immediately. 
Does either counsel know of any legal reason, other
than those already argued, why the sentence shall not be
imposed as stated?

MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Your Honor, I would just like to make
one statement, if I may.  With regard to the fine, the Court
indicated the bequest in the will.  I just want the record to
reflect that that is an unactualized bequest, as Ms. Maxwell
has received nothing, and it is the expectation that she will
receive nothing.
THE COURT:  I understand.  And to be clear, I am not
finding and accept that she hasn't received anything, but there
have only been nonspecific claims that she won't receive
anything and there are additional assets that lead me to the
conclusion that she is able to pay the fine.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Thank you, Judge.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  
And just to confirm, Ms. Sternheim, any legal reason 
why the sentence should not be imposed as stated other than 
what already was argued? 
MS. STERNHEIM:  No, your Honor, but I do have requests
for recommendation.
THE COURT:  I will get there.  Thank you.
The sentence as stated is imposed.  I do find the
sentence is sufficient but not greater than necessary to
satisfy the sentencing purposes that I described earlier.  
Ms. Maxwell, when you are released and on supervised 
release, you will have the guidance and support of the

probation department.  I must caution you to comply strictly 
with all of your conditions of supervised release.  If you are 
brought back before me for a violation of those conditions, I 
may sentence you to another term of imprisonment. 
With that, Ms. Sternheim, requests regarding
designation?
MS. STERNHEIM:  Thank you, Judge.  
We request that Ms. Maxwell be designated, based on a 
recommendation by the Court, to the BOP facility, the women's 
facility in Danbury, and also a recommendation that she be 
enrolled in the FIT program, which is the Female Integrated 
Treatment program, to address past familial and other trauma. 
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. STERNHEIM:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  I recommend to the Bureau of Prisons
consideration of placement in Danbury and consideration of
eligibility for enrollment in the FIT program.
Ms. Moe, remaining counts and underlying indictments
that need to be dismissed at this time?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  The government moves to
dismiss Counts Seven and Eight and any underlying indictments.

Eight are dismissed and any underlying indictments are
dismissed.

days of the judgment of conviction.  
Other matters to take up counsel? 
MS. MOE:  Not from the government, your Honor.  Thank
you.
MS. STERNHEIM:  No.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Let me note, I will issue a housekeeping
order posttrial to ensure complete docketing of all -- any
outstanding materials and complete records, so please look for
that.  I will issue the judgment -- I should just say, Ms. Moe,
the Court intends to indicate the end of the conspiracy date as
the last date in the record, which I believe is in July of
2004, of acts in furtherance of the criminal conduct, and
obviously the government took a different position with respect
to that.  But in light of the Court's finding, any objection to
that?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  We will review the
exhibits.  If that date is different from the sentencing
transcript, we will submit a letter to the Court, but otherwise
no objection, your Honor.
MS. STERNHEIM:  No objection.

would respectfully request that the Court address both the
sentence and the fine in the Court's statement of reasons.

me just check.  I meant to talk about that.  I'm not sure it is
an above-guidelines, but it may be since, as we know, I read
over five to mean five.  So maybe I got that wrong.  Let me
just check.
Oh, you are right.  It is 20 to 200,000 for each 
count.  Do I have that right?

I want to thank counsel.  As I indicated, I do thank

Jeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple, for the last 11 years.  
They are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart – I almost always 
see them together
Ghislaine is highly intelligent, and great company with a ready smile and an 
infectious laugh who always puts one at ones ease, and always makes one 
feel welcome. 
Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun 
together.   They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds. She grew 
up amongst scientists and in an academic and business environment.
They share a love of travel and art. She speaks 5 languages. She enjoys 
spending time visiting auction houses (she says that is the best way to learn 
about art and antiques – your expected to look touch and ask questions)
Ghislaine also has her own interests and has her own business pursuits – she 
is independent and strong willed - something which Jeffrey loves about her - 
She is adventurous – she flies helicopters, she is athletic – she rides horses, 
plays tennis, skis and scuba dives. She is a serious photographer (she always 
has a camera in hand) who is collaborating with some of the leading people 
involved at the cutting edge of digital photography. 
Jeffrey and Ghislaine compliment each other really well and I cannot 
imagine one without the other. On top of being great partners they are also 
the best of friends.

United States Court of Appeals 
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
Docket No. 22-1426 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Appellee, 
—v.— 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, also known as Sealed 
Defendant 1, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
Preliminary Statement 
Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from a judgment of con-
viction entered on June 29, 2022 in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York, 
by the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States Cir-
cuit Judge, sitting by designation, following a four-
and-a-half-week jury trial. 
Superseding Indictment S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the 
“Indictment”) was filed on March 29, 2021, in eight 
counts. Count One charged Maxwell with conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page14 of 93

Maxwell with enticement of a minor, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count Three charged Maxwell 
with conspiracy to transport minors to engage in ille-
gal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
Count Four charged Maxwell with transportation of a 
minor with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five 
charged Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in vi-
olation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell 
with sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 1591(a) & (b)(2) and 2. Counts Seven and Eight 
charged Maxwell with perjury, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1623. 
Trial on Counts One through Six commenced on 
November 29, 2021, and ended on December 29, 2021, 
when the jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One 
and Three through Six, and acquitted Maxwell on 
Count Two. 
On June 29, 2022, Judge Nathan sentenced Max-
well to a term of 240 months’ imprisonment, to be fol-
lowed by five years’ supervised release, and imposed a 
$750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory special assess-
ment. 
Maxwell is serving her sentence. 
Statement of Facts 
A. The Government’s Case 
The Government’s evidence at trial established 
that over the course of a decade, Maxwell facilitated 
and participated in the sexual abuse of multiple young 
girls. From 1994 to 2004, Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page15 of 93

worked together to identify girls, groom them, and 
then entice them to travel and transport them to Ep-
stein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, 
and elsewhere. The girls—some of whom were as 
young as 14 years old—were then sexually abused, of-
ten under the guise of a “massage.” 
The evidence at trial included, among other things, 
the testimony of four women who described the sexual 
abuse they suffered at the hands of Maxwell and Ep-
stein; the testimony of former employees of Epstein 
and Maxwell; the testimony of law enforcement offic-
ers; corroborating physical evidence, including photo-
graphs of and evidence recovered from searches of Ep-
stein’s residences and Maxwell and Epstein’s black ad-
dress book; and other corroborating records, such as 
flight logs of Epstein’s private planes and FedEx rec-
ords. 
Beginning in approximately 1991, Maxwell had a 
close 
and 
intimate 
relationship 
with 
Epstein. 
(Tr.1494-96; GX-422).1 Maxwell was Epstein’s girl-
friend for many years, until the early 2000s, after

Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page16 of 93

which Maxwell and Epstein remained close friends. 
(Tr.1494-96; GX-422). For over a decade, Maxwell 
traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his pri-
vate planes and mingled with rich and famous people, 
while enjoying a life of extraordinary luxury. (Tr.96-
99, 233-34, 303-04, 1194). Maxwell and Epstein spent 
time together in Epstein’s various properties, includ-
ing his mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, 
his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his 
apartment in Paris, and his private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. (Tr.99). Maxwell also received a town-
house that Epstein bought for her in New York City, 
and Epstein transferred more than $23 million to Max-
well during the timeframe of the conspiracy. (Tr.1194, 
1310-17). 
In addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, Max-
well also supervised Epstein’s households as “the lady 
of the house.” (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of 
Epstein’s homes, she imposed strict rules for staff, 
some of which were included in a household manual 
dictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence. 
(Tr.807-08, 823-31). 
To protect her criminal activities from exposure, 
Maxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s 
homes. (Tr.784, 826). The household manual made 
clear that staff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say 
nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that 
staff member. (Tr.826). Maxwell directed Juan Alessi, 
the former manager of Epstein’s Palm Beach villa, to 
speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look 
Epstein in the eyes. (Tr.784). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page17 of 93

This culture of silence provided cover for Maxwell 
and Epstein to sexually abuse young girls. In the early 
phase of the conspiracy, between 1994 and 2001, Max-
well and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically 
from single-mother households and difficult financial 
circumstances. (Tr.295, 1178, 2051-52). Maxwell and 
Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with 
them away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99, 
1175-82, 2069-70, 2077-79). During that time, they 
groomed the girls through techniques such as giving 
them gifts, pretending to be friends, and building 
trust. (Tr.298-303, 348, 2079-81). Maxwell and Ep-
stein then normalized sexual situations and sexual 
touching. (Tr.300-01, 2081-84). Finally, they transi-
tioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of 
giving Epstein a massage. (Tr.306-15, 319-23, 1183-88, 
2084-88).2 
In the later phase of the scheme, from 2001 through 
2004, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls 
who recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm 
Beach residence. (Tr.1518-25, 1543-46). Maxwell and 
Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in 
————— 
These techniques were the textbook methods of 
child predators. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in 
psychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic 
stress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-
dren are most frequently sexually abused through 
grooming and coercion in the context of a relationship. 
(Tr.713). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a se-
ries of deceptive tactics to engage a child in sexual 
abuse. (Tr.715-20). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page18 of 93

exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused, 
under the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. 
(Tr.1518-25, 1540-41, 1544-46). Once a girl was intro-
duced to these sexualized massages, she was offered 
more money if she brought other girls to engage in sex-
ualized massages. (Tr.1544-45). 
The trial evidence focused on six girls who suffered 
abusive sexual contact as a result of Maxwell’s crimi-
nal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn, Virginia, and 
Melissa. 
1. Sexual Abuse of Jane 
Maxwell and Epstein met Jane in 1994 when she 
was just 14 years old at a summer camp for talented 
kids. (Tr.290-94). Jane was particularly vulnerable, as 
her father had just died (a fact that she told both Ep-
stein and Maxwell), and her family was struggling fi-
nancially. (Tr.293-94). Maxwell and Epstein cultivated 
a relationship with Jane, spending time with her at 
Epstein’s Palm Beach home and taking her to the mov-
ies and shopping. (Tr.295-302, 348). Maxwell and Ep-
stein gave Jane gifts, and Jane came to look up to Max-
well like an older sister figure. (Tr.298-301). 
Maxwell and Epstein sexually abused Jane start-
ing when she was 14 years old, and the sexual abuse 
continued for years. (Tr.306-15). When Jane was still 
only 14 years old, Maxwell and Epstein instructed 
Jane to follow them to Epstein’s bedroom where Max-
well and Epstein fondled each other, casually giggling, 
while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (Tr.307). 
After this sexual interaction, Maxwell and Epstein 
taught Jane how Epstein liked to be massaged and 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page19 of 93

gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis. 
(Tr.308-11). Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by 
Epstein between the ages of 14 and 16 years old, and 
Maxwell was frequently in the room when the abuse 
happened. (Tr.307-15). Over time, the abuse escalated, 
as Epstein used vibrators on Jane, put his fingers in 
Jane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face. 
(Tr.319-20). Maxwell sometimes touched Jane, includ-
ing on her breasts, during these incidents. (Tr.311). 
Jane also traveled with Maxwell (who assisted Jane in 
making travel arrangements) and Epstein to Epstein’s 
townhouse in New York City and his ranch in New 
Mexico, where she was sexually abused. (Tr.316-24). 
2. Sexual Abuse of Kate 
Maxwell and Epstein’s sexual abuse of Kate started 
in 1994, around the same time that Maxwell and Ep-
stein started sexually abusing Jane. (Tr.1172, 1179-
86). After Kate, then 17 years old, told Maxwell that 
she lived alone with her mother and had a difficult 
home life, Maxwell introduced Kate to Epstein in Lon-
don. (Tr.1178-82). Maxwell delivered Kate to a naked 
Epstein in Maxwell’s own home for massages and told 
Kate to “have a good time.” (Tr.1182-89). During these 
massages, Epstein initiated sexual contact. (Id.). 
Kate traveled to meet both Maxwell and Epstein in 
Palm Beach, the Virgin Islands, and New York City 
between the ages of 18 and 24. (Tr.1190-98). Epstein 
initiated sexual activity with Kate every time she vis-
ited him. (Id.). Maxwell brought up sexual topics with 
Kate, ranging from talking about how sexually de-
manding Epstein was to asking if Kate knew “anybody 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page20 of 93

who could come and give Jeffrey a blow job” to remark-
ing that Epstein liked cute, young, pretty girls like 
Kate. (Tr.1191-93). 
When Kate was approximately 18 years old, she 
visited Epstein and Maxwell in Palm Beach. (Tr.1199). 
Maxwell left a schoolgirl outfit for Kate and said it 
would be fun for Kate to wear for Epstein. (Tr.1200-
01). Kate—alone in a place she had never previously 
visited—complied. (Id.). Epstein initiated sexual con-
tact with Kate and engaged in a sex act with her. 
(Tr.1202). Later that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she 
had fun and told Kate that she was a “good girl” and 
“one of [Epstein’s] favorites.” (Tr.1202). Epstein en-
gaged in unwanted sexual activity with Kate multiple 
times during that same trip. (Id.). 
3. Sexual Abuse of Annie Farmer 
Maxwell also took steps to normalize sexual contact 
with Annie Farmer, who was then 16 years old. Annie 
first met Epstein on a trip to New York, where she and 
her older sister visited Epstein’s Manhattan town-
house, and during which Epstein began to groom An-
nie by stroking her hand and leg while watching a 
movie with her. (Tr.2056-61). In the spring of 1996, 
Annie’s mother, at Epstein’s request, agreed to send 
Annie to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico for a retreat 
for a group of students who were academically gifted. 
(Tr.2069-70, 2253-55). Annie felt more comfortable go-
ing once she understood that Maxwell, a grown woman 
in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would be 
there. (Tr.2077). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page21 of 93

During the New Mexico trip, Maxwell took steps to 
normalize sexual contact under the ruse of massage. 
Maxwell instructed Annie to hold Epstein’s foot and 
showed her how to give Epstein a foot massage. 
(Tr.2083-84). Maxwell then offered to give Annie a 
massage. (Tr.2084-85). After telling Annie to get un-
dressed, Maxwell gave Annie a massage on a massage 
table while Annie was naked. (Tr.2085). During the 
massage, Maxwell directed Annie to roll over so that 
Annie was laying on her back. (Id.). After Annie com-
plied and rolled to her back, Maxwell pulled the sheet 
down and exposed Annie’s breasts. (Id.). Then, while 
Annie was naked, Maxwell rubbed Annie’s breasts. 
(Tr.2085-86). 
During this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later 
got into Annie’s bed, cuddled with her, pressed his 
body into her, and rubbed against her. (Tr.2086-87, 
2224). But when Annie managed to extricate herself 
from the situation by running to the bathroom, 
thereby denying Epstein further sexual contact, Max-
well seemed “very disinterested” in Annie for the re-
mainder of the trip. (Tr.2086-88). 
4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts 
Beginning in or about the summer of 2000, Max-
well and Epstein entered a new phase of their scheme 
to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Max-
well recruited a 17-year-old girl named Virginia Rob-
erts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Ep-
stein with massages. (Tr.840-46). Over the next sev-
eral months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with 
sexualized massages at his Palm Beach residence, in 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page22 of 93

exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each mas-
sage. (Tr.840-46. 1518-24, 1742-46). Virginia also trav-
eled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations, in-
cluding New York and the Virgin Islands, on Epstein’s 
private plane. (Tr.1854-70). Virginia brought other 
teenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (Tr.845). 
One of those girls was a 14-year-old girl named Car-
olyn who Virginia introduced to Maxwell and Epstein 
at the Palm Beach villa in 2001. (Tr.1518-24). 
5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn 
Carolyn met Maxwell the very first time she went 
to Epstein’s house, and she interacted with Maxwell 
multiple times thereafter. (Tr.1520-21). On Carolyn’s 
first visit to the house, Maxwell greeted Virginia, who 
introduced Carolyn to Maxwell. (Id.). Maxwell then 
told Virginia, “You can bring her upstairs and show 
her what to do,” after which Virginia showed Carolyn 
how to perform a sexual massage on Epstein. (Tr.1521-
23). 
Thereafter, Carolyn performed over 100 paid sexu-
alized massages for Epstein when she was between 14 
and 18 years old. (Tr.1525). The vast majority involved 
the same course of abuse through which Epstein mas-
turbated, touched Carolyn’s breasts and buttocks, and 
directed Carolyn to touch his nipples. (Tr.1545-46). 
Epstein also attempted to touch Carolyn’s vagina with 
a vibrator, brought other females into the room to en-
gage in oral sex with Carolyn, and raped Carolyn by 
penetrating her vagina with his penis. (Tr.1545-47). 
At first, Maxwell personally scheduled Carolyn’s 
appointments with Epstein, including on phone calls 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page23 of 93

from New York, and sometimes sent a car to pick Car-
olyn up because she was too young to drive. (Tr.1524, 
1527-32). Maxwell also engaged Carolyn in conversa-
tions during which Carolyn revealed that she had pre-
viously been sexually abused by a relative, that her 
parents were separated, and that her mother strug-
gled with addiction. (Tr.1533-36). Maxwell invited 
Carolyn to travel with Maxwell and Epstein, but Car-
olyn responded that because she was only 14 years old, 
she would not be able to get permission to travel. 
(Tr.1534-35). Carolyn was paid several hundred dol-
lars in one-hundred-dollar bills after each massage, 
and Carolyn also received gifts of lingerie from Epstein 
and Maxwell shipped from Manhattan to her home in 
Florida. (Tr.1540-42). Usually, the money was laid out 
on the table or by the sink in the bathroom, but Max-
well personally paid Carolyn after a few massages. 
(Tr.1540-41). 
Maxwell saw Carolyn fully nude in the massage 
room on approximately three occasions when Carolyn 
had already undressed in preparation for the massage 
but before Epstein entered the room. (Tr.1536-38). On 
one such occasion, when Carolyn was 14 years old, 
Maxwell told Carolyn that she had a nice body and 
touched Carolyn’s breasts. (Id.). 
At some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had 
any young friends she could bring for massages. 
(Tr.1544). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to 
Epstein for sexualized massages, including multiple 
minors. (Tr.1544-46, 1753-54). When Carolyn brought 
girls to massage Epstein, both the girl and Carolyn 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page24 of 93

would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (Tr.1544-
45). 
6. Sexual Abuse of Melissa 
One of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide 
paid sexualized massages to Epstein was a 16-year-old 
named Melissa. (Tr.1753, 1758-61). Melissa went to 
Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein with massages 
on multiple occasions when she was under the age of 
18. (Id.). When Melissa and Carolyn went to the Palm 
Beach house, they remained in the home for about an 
hour and then returned with hundreds of dollars in 
cash. (Id.). 
B. The Defense Case, Verdict, and Sentencing 
Maxwell called nine witnesses in her defense case, 
including former employees and associates, as well as 
an expert on memory. (Tr.2327-2531, 2595-2684). 
On December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell 
guilty of Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. 
(A.86). 
On April 1, 2022, Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s 
motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 33 based on a juror’s provision of 
inaccurate information during jury selection, as dis-
cussed in greater deal in Point III, infra. (A.318-57). 
On April 29, 2022, Judge Nathan denied all but one of 
Maxwell’s remaining post-trial motions. (A.358-402). 
Judge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts 
(Counts One, Three, and Five) were multiplicitous and 
that she would, therefore, enter judgment on Count 
Three alone among the conspiracy counts. (Id. at 3). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page25 of 93

On June 29, 2022, Judge Nathan sentenced Max-
well to 60 months’ imprisonment on Count Three, 120 
months’ imprisonment on Count Four, and 240 
months’ imprisonment on Count Six, all to run concur-
rently, to be followed by five years’ supervised release, 
and imposed a $750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory 
special assessment. 
A R G U M E N T  
POINT I 
The District Court Correctly Concluded That 
Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement 
Does Not Bar Maxwell’s Prosecution in the 
Southern District of New York 
In 2007, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of Florida entered into a non-prosecution 
agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell argues that 
this agreement, which neither she nor the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office for the Southern District of New York 
signed, nevertheless bars her prosecution in the 
Southern District of New York in this case, and she 
twice sought dismissal of the charges in the Indict-
ment on that ground. The District Court denied the 
motions to dismiss, correctly recognizing that Max-
well’s argument is precluded by the text of the agree-
ment and this Court’s longstanding precedent. Accord-
ingly, this Court should affirm the denial of the mo-
tions to dismiss. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page26 of 93

A. Relevant Facts 
In 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department in 
Florida opened an investigation into Epstein on the 
complaint of the parents of a fourteen-year-old girl. 
The Palm Beach Police ultimately brought the investi-
gation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in West 
Palm Beach, which in turned opened an investigation 
with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern Dis-
trict of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”). (SA3). That investiga-
tion culminated in a draft sixty-page indictment pro-
posing to charge Epstein for the sexual abuse of multi-
ple victims. (SA3). 
In 2007, the USAO-SDFL and Epstein entered into 
a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). (A.173). The 
agreement was signed “on the authority of R. Alexan-
der Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida.” (A.175). Under the terms of the 
NPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty in a pending Flor-
ida state case and to receive a sentence of at least 
eighteen months’ imprisonment and twelve months’ 
community control. (A.176). He also consented to juris-
diction in the Southern District of Florida for civil suits 
involving victims specified by the USAO-SDFL, among 
other terms. (A.177). In exchange, USAO-SDFL 
agreed to defer “prosecution in this District.” (A.175). 
Once Epstein completed his half of the bargain, the 
NPA provided that “no prosecution” for the offenses 
then under investigation by “the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office . . . will be 
instituted in this District.” (A.175). 
The NPA also provided that, if Epstein complied 
with the agreement, “the United States also agrees 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page27 of 93

that it will not institute any criminal charges against 
any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but 
not limited to” four named individuals, none of whom 
was Maxwell. (A.178). Indeed, Maxwell was neither a 
party to the agreement nor involved in negotiating its 
terms. This provision “appears to have been added 
‘with little discussion or consideration by the prosecu-
tors.’ ” (A.140 (citing SA195, 211)). The NPA continues 
that, “upon execution of this agreement, and a plea 
agreement with the State Attorney’s Office, the federal 
Grand Jury investigation will be suspended.” (A.178). 
The agreement was executed on September 24, 2007 
(A.182), and Epstein pleaded guilty in state court on 
June 30, 2008 (SA137). In 2019, the Department of 
Justice Office of Professional Responsibility conducted 
an investigation into the negotiations around the NPA 
and issued a 290-page report containing detailed fac-
tual findings. (SA1-348). 
After the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”) charged Max-
well in this case in the Southern District of New York, 
she twice moved to dismiss the charges on the ground 
that they were barred by the NPA. The District Court 
denied the motions, concluding that “the NPA does not 
bind the [USAO-SDNY].” (A.140-45, 189-92). 
B. Applicable Law 
This Court has long held that “[a] plea agreement 
binds only the office of the United States Attorney for 
the district in which the plea is entered unless it af-
firmatively appears that the agreement contemplates 
a broader restriction.” United States v. Annabi, 771 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page28 of 93

F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985); accord, e.g., United States 
v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010); United 
States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998). The 
requisite affirmative appearance may be established 
by “an express statement” in the plea agreement, or it 
may be “inferred from the negotiations between de-
fendant and prosecutor, as well as from statements at 
the plea colloquy.” United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 
624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). 
This Court reviews de novo both the denial of a mo-
tion to dismiss an indictment and the interpretation of 
a plea agreement. United States v. Montague, 67 F.4th 
520, 527 (2d Cir. 2023); United States v. Padilla, 186 
F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 1999). This Court reviews for 
abuse of discretion a district court’s denial of an evi-
dentiary hearing before ruling on a motion to dismiss. 
United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22, 28 (2d Cir. 
2018); United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295, 305 
(2d Cir. 2016). 
C. Discussion 
The District Court correctly rejected Maxwell’s ar-
gument that the NPA bars this prosecution. Maxwell 
has no right to invoke the protections of the NPA be-
cause she is neither a party to nor a third-party bene-
ficiary of the agreement. But even if Maxwell had 
standing under the NPA, it would not bar this prose-
cution because it was plainly intended to bind only the 
USAO-SDFL. Thus, Judge Nathan rightly concluded 
that under longstanding Second Circuit precedent, the 
NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY. Accordingly, this 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page29 of 93

Court should affirm the denial of Maxwell’s motions to 
dismiss. 
1. Maxwell Is Not Entitled to Enforce the NPA 
As an initial matter, Maxwell has no right to invoke 
the protections of the NPA. Maxwell was not a signa-
tory to the agreement. While the third-party benefi-
ciary doctrine is a tenet of contract law (Br.16), its ap-
plication to plea agreements under federal law is a sep-
arate question because plea agreements differ from 
commercial contracts in meaningful respects. United 
States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d 182, 189 (2d Cir. 2019) 
(“We have long recognized that plea agreements are 
significantly different from commercial contracts.”). It 
is doubtful that a third-party beneficiary can enforce a 
plea agreement. See United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 
33, 37 (1st Cir. 1991) (observing that “we are unaware 
of authority” supporting application of “third party 
beneficiary principles . . . to a plea agreement in a 
criminal case”); United States v. Mariamma Viju, No. 
Cr. 240, 2016 WL 107841, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 11, 
2016) (explaining that “[t]he right to enforce a plea 
deal does not exist for its own sake; rather, it is a 
means to achieve fairness in plea bargaining,” and “en-
forcement by third parties adds nothing to protecting 
the defendant’s right”). 
In any event, even under the third-party benefi-
ciary law on which Maxwell relies (Br.16), she would 
have to show that “the original parties intended the 
[agreement] to directly benefit [her] as [a] third 
part[y].” United States v. Wilson, 216 F.3d 645, 663 
(7th Cir. 2000) (assuming without deciding that third 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page30 of 93

party could enforce immunity agreement); see also 
United States v. Fla. W. Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. 
Supp. 2d 1209, 1228 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (third party must 
show that “a direct and primary object of the contract-
ing parties was to confer a benefit on the third party” 
(quoting Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 
982 (11th Cir. 2005))). Here, Maxwell has failed to 
make the requisite showing: she is not named in the 
provision 
naming 
four 
potential 
co-conspirator 
(A.178), and she has offered no evidence that the par-
ties to the NPA intended to confer a benefit on her spe-
cifically. Accordingly, Maxwell may not enforce the 
NPA. 
2. The NPA’s Terms Bind Only the USAO-
SDFL 
Even if Maxwell had a right to invoke the NPA’s 
protections, it would not bar the charges in this case. 
By its terms, the NPA only applies to prosecutions 
brought by the USAO-SDFL. The agreement was 
signed “on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, 
United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida.” (A.175). And in exchange for Epstein’s plea in 
state court, the USAO-SDFL agreed to defer “prosecu-
tion in this District”—that is, the Southern District of 
Florida. (A.175). The USAO-SDFL further promised 
that no prosecution by “the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office . . . will be insti-
tuted in this District.” (A.175). An agreement by the 
USAO-SDFL not to prosecute Epstein in the Southern 
District of Florida is an agreement intended to apply 
only to the USAO-SDFL and only in the Southern Dis-
trict of Florida. Moreover, the agreement was signed 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page31 of 93

by officials of the USAO-SDFL and by no other compo-
nents of the Department of Justice. Accordingly, the 
plain terms of the NPA make clear that the agreement 
only binds the USAO-SDFL. 
Maxwell’s argument that the NPA binds the 
USAO-SDNY relies on a separate provision of the 
agreement, which says that “the United States also 
agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges 
against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, in-
cluding but not limited to” a list of four individuals 
that does not include the defendant (A.178). (Br.15, 
33). But her argument that the term “United States” 
means the entire federal government requires the 
term to be read in isolation. As Judge Nathan ex-
plained, terms like “the United States” or “the govern-
ment” are “common shorthand” for a single U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office, and “a plea agreement need not painstak-
ingly spell out ‘the Office of the United States Attorney 
for Such-and-Such District’ in every instance to make 
clear that it applies only in the district where signed” 
(A.141). See Salameh, 152 F.3d at 120 (“The mere use 
of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does 
not create an affirmative appearance that the agree-
ment contemplated barring districts other than the 
particular district entering into the agreement.”); 
United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 
2004) (“Although paragraph 12(b) uses the term 
‘United States’ rather than the term ‘government,’ this 
is a distinction from our prior caselaw without a differ-
ence.”). 
Reading the NPA as a whole confirms that conclu-
sion. The very next sentence of the agreement states 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page32 of 93

that “the federal Grand Jury investigation will be sus-
pended.” (A.178 (emphasis added)). The grand jury in-
vestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-
fer in the same agreement (A.175), and not any poten-
tial federal grand jury investigations in other districts. 
Furthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United 
States” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-
SDFL. For instance, the NPA commits the “United 
States”—that is, the USAO-SDFL—to providing Ep-
stein with a list of victims. (A.177 (“The United States 
shall provide Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individ-
uals whom it has identified as victims . . . .”)). Another 
provision states that the NPA will not be made part of 
the public record and commits “the United States”—
again, the USAO-SDFL—to providing notice to Ep-
stein if it receives a Freedom of Information Act re-
quest requiring disclosure of the agreement. (A.178). 
The mere fact that the co-conspirator provision of the 
NPA used the phrase “United States” rather than 
“U.S. Attorney’s Office” is not evidence that the parties 
intended an unusually broad immunity provision. See, 
e.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S. 
519, 540 (2013) (“We are not aware, however, of any 
canon of interpretation that forbids interpreting differ-
ent words used in different parts of the same statute 
to mean roughly the same thing.”). As Judge Nathan 
concluded, given the repeated limitations of the com-
mitments in the NPA to the USAO-SDFL, including 
the commitment not to prosecute Epstein, “[i]t is not 
plausible . . . that the parties intended to drastically 
expand the agreement’s scope in the single sentence on 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page33 of 93

the prosecution of co-conspirators without clearly say-
ing so.” (A.142).3 
Maxwell also points to the NPA provision stating 
that “Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and 
federal criminal liability.” (A.175). Based on that 
statement, Maxwell argues that Epstein’s purpose in 
negotiating the NPA was to “obtain a global resolution 
that would, among other things, provide maximum 
protection for any alleged co-conspirators.” (Br.34). 
But the cited provision only says that Epstein sought 
to resolve “his” liability, not anyone else’s. Further-
more, under Maxwell’s reading, Epstein bargained for 
a truly “global” resolution only for his co-conspirators, 
and limited his own “global” resolution expressly to the 
USAO-SDFL. There is no reason to believe that Ep-
stein expressly sought and obtained broader immunity 
for his co-conspirators than he did for himself. (See 
also SA107 n.125 (observing that a supervisor at the 
USAO-SDFL “pointed out that the NPA was not a 
————— 
Maxwell also relies on draft plea agreements 
which “expressly defined the term ‘United States’ as 
limited to” USAO-SDFL. Those plea agreements—
which differed significantly from the NPA—also use 
both the terms “United States” and “United States At-
torney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida,” in-
cluding using the USAO-SDFL term expressly in the 
context of the co-conspirator provision. (See, e.g., 
Dkt.142, Ex. F at 2). This point only highlights the par-
ties’ understanding at all times that their negotiations 
merely bound the USAO-SDFL, and not the entire fed-
eral government. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page34 of 93

‘global resolution’ and other co-conspirators could have 
been prosecuted ‘by any other [U.S. Attorney’s] office 
in the country.’ ”)). 
Lacking support in the text of the NPA itself, Max-
well attempts to show that the NPA applies here based 
on “the negotiations between defendant and prosecu-
tor.” Russo, 801 F.2d at 626. In particular, Maxwell 
claims that the negotiating history of the NPA shows 
that “[s]enior levels of Main Justice were directly in-
volved in the negotiation and approval of the NPA, 
even to the extent that separate presentations were 
made to, and approval of the NPA was obtained from, 
the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.” (Br.36). 
This assertion, however, mischaracterizes the record 
and further underscores the absence of any senior ap-
provals in negotiating the NPA. The pages to which 
Maxwell cites describe activities after the NPA was 
signed, in which Justice Department officials in Wash-
ington refused to relieve Epstein of his obligations un-
der the NPA. (Br.36 (citing SA120-23, 129-44); A.143 
(“The OPR report reflects that the Office of the Deputy 
Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it 
was signed when Epstein tried to get out of it.”)). Even 
then, however, those officials did not “approve” the 
NPA. (SA121 (statement by the Assistant Attorney 
General that she “did not review or approve the agree-
ment either before or after it was signed”), 129 (“The 
Department, however, only reviewed the issue of fed-
eral jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA or any 
specific provisions.”)). Maxwell also cobbles together 
instances in which the USAO-SDFL and the FBI in 
Florida enlisted the assistance of other components of 
the federal government or considered acting outside 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page35 of 93

Florida, such as the USAO-SDFL’s “contact with wit-
nesses in New York.” (Br.38). These disparate and un-
connected events do not show that the USAO-SDFL 
acted on behalf of the entire federal government when 
entering into the NPA, or that Epstein understood the 
USAO-SDFL to be doing so. 
Maxwell also advances several arguments attempt-
ing to minimize or side-step this Court’s precedent. For 
example, Maxwell argues that Annabi applies only if 
the charges in the indictment are “sufficiently distinct” 
from the counts resolved by the earlier agreement. 
(Br.30-33 (quoting 771 F.2d at 672)). Not so. The rele-
vant portion of Annabi concerned an argument by the 
defendants that in seeking to have a plea agreement 
in the Eastern District of New York bar the pending 
charges in the Southern District of New York, they 
were “seeking only the same protection accorded by 
th[e Double Jeopardy] Clause.” 771 F.2d at 672. This 
Court rejected that argument, reasoning that even if 
the Double Jeopardy Clause applied (notwithstanding 
that the defendants were “never in jeopardy” on those 
charges in the Eastern District), the defendants would 
not be entitled to relief because the pending charges 
“extended for an additional two years” and thus were 
“not the same as the charges that were dismissed.” Id. 
Thus, Annabi did not hold that its rule—that “[a] plea 
agreement binds only the office of the United States 
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered 
unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement 
contemplates a broader restriction,” id.—applies only 
if the charges are sufficiently distinct. And as Judge 
Nathan recognized, “no subsequent Second Circuit 
case applying Annabi has so held.” (A.191). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page36 of 93

Next, Maxwell argues that this Court should disre-
gard its own precedents and instead apply Eleventh 
Circuit law because “the NPA was negotiated in Flor-
ida, with Southern District of Florida prosecutors, in 
exchange for Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty in 
Florida state court.” (Br.25). But this Court has con-
sistently applied Annabi even when considering plea 
agreements from out-of-Circuit districts. Prisco, 391 F. 
App’x at 921 (District of New Jersey); United States v. 
Ashraf, 320 F. App’x 26, 28 (2d Cir. 2009) (Eastern Dis-
trict of Virginia); Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 270 (District 
of New Mexico). United States v. Brown, No. 99-
1230(L), 2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. 2004) 
(Southern District of Florida).4 These decisions are 
consistent with choice-of-law principles in criminal 
cases, where “[t]he governing law is always that of the 
forum state, if the forum court has jurisdiction.” Amer-
ican Conflicts Law 375 (5th ed. 2021); see 2 Attorney-
Client Privilege in the United States § 12:10 (“Choice 
of law scholars have long recognized that criminal law 
is peculiarly local in nature, and it is settled that, in 
criminal prosecutions, the court will routinely apply 
the substantive law of the forum.”); American Conflicts 
Law 390 (“[A]s a sort of corollary to the local nature of 
————— 
While these are nonprecedential decisions, this 
Court does not lightly depart from prior panels’ sum-
mary orders. United States v. Payne, 591 F.3d 46, 48 
(2d Cir. 2010) (“[D]enying summary orders preceden-
tial effect does not mean that the court considers itself 
free to rule differently in similar cases.”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page37 of 93

substantive criminal law,” “[p]rocedures in criminal 
cases are always those of the forum.”).5 
In any event, Eleventh Circuit law would not sup-
port Maxwell’s claim. Maxwell does not cite any Elev-
enth Circuit decisions addressing when one U.S. At-
torney’s Office is bound by a plea agreement with an-
other U.S. Attorney’s Office. But in an analogous con-
text, the Eleventh Circuit held that a U.S. Attorney’s 
promise made in a plea agreement—that a criminal 
defendant would not be deported—was unenforceable 
because the U.S. Attorney lacked authority to make 
that promise. San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 
1065, 1072 (11th Cir. 1996). If the Eleventh Circuit 
were to apply the reasoning of San Pedro to the issue 
in this case, it would likely reach the same result be-
cause a U.S. Attorney only has authority to act “within 
his district,” 28 U.S.C. § 547, and must seek the 
————— 
Maxwell cites a handful of district court cases 
that apply the exclusionary rule of a foreign circuit to 
prevent, in her words, “the Government from para-
chuting into a new circuit and prosecuting a case it 
would not otherwise have been able to bring.” (Br.29). 
This “inter-circuit exclusionary rule,” as Maxwell calls 
it, is hardly a settled doctrine. See American Conflicts 
Law 391-94 (discussing cases in both directions). In 
any event, the purpose of this putative rule is tied to 
its context: “to ensure that the proper level of deter-
rence is maintained in the locale where the violation 
occurred.” (Br.29 (quoting United States v. Restrepo, 
890 F. Supp. 180, 191 (E.D.N.Y. 1995)). That rationale 
is inapplicable here. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page38 of 93

approval of each affected U.S. Attorney’s Office before 
entering into any non-prosecution agreement that pur-
ports to bind another district. See Justice Manual § 9-
27.641 (“No district or division shall make any agree-
ment, including any agreement not to prosecute, which 
purports to bind any other district(s) or division with-
out the approval of the United States Attorney(s) in 
each affected district and/or the appropriate Assistant 
Attorney General.”). 
Finally, Maxwell devotes much of her brief to criti-
cizing Annabi. (E.g., Br.18-23). But this Court’s rule is 
sound, as it ensures that a criminal defendant (or 
even, as here, a co-conspirator) will not receive the 
windfall of immunity that was never intended by the 
parties to the original agreement, while leaving par-
ties free to enter into legitimate multi-district resolu-
tions if they wish. Nor has Maxwell’s parade of horri-
bles come to pass in the decades since Annabi was de-
cided. Furthermore, the same rule has long been ap-
plied in the Seventh Circuit. See Thompson v. United 
States, 431 F. App’x 491, 493 (7th Cir. 2011); United 
States v. Rourke, 74 F.3d 802, 807 n.5 (7th Cir. 1996). 
In any event, this Court need not engage in a point-by-
point analysis of the merits of Annabi, because it re-
mains binding precedent. See United States v. Wilker-
son, 361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir. 2004) (Court is “bound 
by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they 
are overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court 
or by the Supreme Court”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page39 of 93

Thus, Epstein’s NPA with the USAO-SDFL does 
not bar this prosecution of Maxwell, and Judge Na-
than correctly denied the motions to dismiss.6 
3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its 
Discretion in Declining to Conduct a 
Hearing 
Finally, Maxwell argues that the District Court 
erred by denying her motions to dismiss without an 
evidentiary hearing. (Br.38-40). But as Judge Nathan 
explained, the cases cited by Maxwell in support of her 
request for a hearing “mostly involved oral agreements 
where there was no written record of the full set of 
terms reached by the parties,” and all of which “in-
volved defendants with first-hand knowledge of the ne-
gotiations. . . . This is no such case. The NPA’s terms 
are clear.” (A.145). Furthermore, Maxwell had “an un-
usually large amount of information about the NPA’s 
negotiation history in the form of the OPR report yet 
————— 
Even if the NPA were deemed to apply here, it 
would only cover Count Six, which concerns a victim 
known to USAO-SDFL and a statute mentioned in the 
NPA, and not Counts Three and Four, which concern 
different or additional victims and offenses over an ex-
panded time period. Maxwell’s suggestion that the co-
conspirator provision “is not limited to any particular 
offense or any time period” (Br.40) is based on the 
premise that the USAO-SDFL immunized Maxwell for 
any and all crimes, past or future, and highlights the 
unreasonableness of reading the NPA to apply to other 
U.S. Attorney’s Offices. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page40 of 93

identifies no evidence that the Department of Justice 
made any promises not contained in the NPA.” (A.142-
43). Here, as below, Maxwell’s further request for a 
hearing “rests on mere conjecture.” (A.145). Judge Na-
than did not abuse her discretion. 
POINT II 
The District Court Correctly Concluded that the 
Charges Were Timely 
In 2003, Congress extended the statute of limita-
tions for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical 
abuse” of a minor to allow prosecution so long as the 
victim remains alive. 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Attempting to 
undermine the clear legislative intent, Maxwell argues 
that the amendment did not apply to her case because 
her crimes both pre-dated the amendment and did not 
involve sexual abuse. These arguments fly in the face 
of the statutory text, legislative history, this Court’s 
own decisions, and the persuasive authority of other 
Circuits. The charges fell squarely within the amended 
statute of limitations, and this Court should affirm 
Judge Nathan’s well-reasoned decisions denying Max-
well’s motions to dismiss the charges as untimely. 
A. Applicable Law 
1. Standard of Review 
This Court reviews de novo both the denial of a mo-
tion to dismiss an indictment and the application of a 
statute of limitations. United States v. Sampson, 898 
F.3d 270, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2018). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page41 of 93

2. Statutes of Limitations for Offenses 
Against Children (18 U.S.C. § 3283) and 
Child Abduction and Sex Offenses (18 
U.S.C. § 3299) 
Most federal noncapital offenses carry a five-year 
statute of limitations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a). In 1990, 
Congress enacted a provision titled, “Extension of 
Child Statute of Limitations,” which provided that 
“[n]o statute of limitation that would otherwise pre-
clude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual 
or physical abuse of a child under the age of 18 years 
shall preclude such a prosecution before the child 
reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of 
1990, Pub. L. No. 101-647, tit. II, § 225(a), 104 Stat. 
4789, 4798 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (1990)). 
This provision “extended the federal criminal limita-
tions period for child sex abuse offenses, making it eas-
ier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that 
may be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten v. 
United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2017). In 1994, 
Congress re-codified this provision, moving it to 18 
U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language. Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 
103-322, tit. XXXIII, § 330018(a), 108 Stat. 1796, 2149 
(codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (1994)). 
Within a decade, “Congress began to view even the 
extended statute of limitations period in the 1994 ver-
sion of § 3283 as ‘inadequate in many cases’ because it 
released from criminal liability sex abusers whose 
crimes were not brought to the attention of federal au-
thorities until after their victims turned twenty-five.” 
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page42 of 93

108–66, at 54 (2003)). Accordingly, in 2003, Congress 
enacted a provision titled, “No Statute of Limitations 
for Child Abduction and Sex Crimes,” which amended 
Section 3283 to read: “No statute of limitations that 
would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense 
involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, 
of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such 
prosecution during the life of the child.” Prosecutorial

3. Retroactivity under Landgraf 
In Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 
(1994), the Supreme Court set forth a two-part frame-
work for determining whether a statute may be ap-
plied retroactively. At the first step, “if Congress ex-
pressly prescribed that a statute applies retroactively 
to antecedent conduct, the inquiry ends and the court 
enforces the statute as it is written, save for constitu-
tional concerns.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55. If, 
however, the “statute is ambiguous or contains no ex-
press command regarding retroactivity,” then the 
court must turn to the second step, where “a reviewing 
court must determine whether applying the statute to 
antecedent conduct would create presumptively im-
permissible retroactive effects.” Id. at 55. “If it would, 
then the court shall not apply the statute retroactively 
absent clear congressional intent to the contrary.” Id. 
“If it would not, then the court shall apply the statute 
to antecedent conduct.” Id. 
B. Discussion 
1. There Was No Impermissible Retroactivity 
in Applying Section 3283 to Maxwell 
Maxwell claims that the District Court erred by ap-
plying Section 3283’s 2003 amendment to her three 
counts of conviction, i.e., Counts Three, Four, and Six, 
because they involved conduct that pre-dated the 
amendment. As an initial matter, this argument ig-
nores the fact that Counts Three and Six both charge 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page44 of 93

continuing offenses that continued into 2004, thus 
post-dating Section 3283’s amendment. Moreover, un-
der the Landgraf framework, the 2003 amendment 
properly applies to pre-enactment criminal conduct 
that still could have been timely prosecuted at the time 
of the enactment, as was the case here. 
a. 
There Was No Retroactivity as to 
Counts Three and Six 
As an initial matter, Counts Three and Six both 
charged conduct that continued through 2004, i.e., af-
ter the 2003 amendment to Section 3283, and thus pre-
sent no retroactivity concerns. 
For conspiracy charges requiring proof of an overt 
act, including 18 U.S.C. § 371, the conspiracy statute 
at issue here, “[t]he statute of limitations runs from 
the date of the last overt act in furtherance of the con-
spiracy.” United States v. Monaco, 194 F.3d 381, 387 
n.2 (2d Cir. 1999); accord United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 
F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2001). Similarly, for a continuing 
substantive offense, the statute of limitations only 
“begin[s] to run when the crime is complete,” meaning 
when “the conduct has run its course.” United States 
v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 46 (2d Cir. 2008). 
Here, the Indictment alleged that the conspiracy 
charged in Count Three and the sex trafficking offense 
charged in Count Six continued through 2004. (A.127, 
132; see also A.123-24, 131-32 (describing conduct 
through 2004 involving Victim-4)).7 Thus, the statute 
————— 
To the extent Maxwell’s argument challenges 
the sufficiency of the evidence rather than the denial 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page45 of 93

of limitations for these two counts did not begin to run 
until 2004, well after Congress enacted the 2003 
amendment to Section 3283. Maxwell’s arguments 
about retroactivity are therefore inapplicable to 
Counts Three and Six. 
b. 
Applying Section 3283 to Maxwell 
Complies with Landgraf 
Furthermore, under the Landgraf framework, the 
2003 amendment to Section 3283 properly applies to 
pre-enactment conduct for which the statute of limita-
tions had not expired at the time the amendment was 
passed. Because the statute of limitations had not ex-
pired when Congress amended Section 3283 in 2003, 
that amendment extended the limitations period for 
prosecuting Maxwell, rendering the charges timely. 
i. 
Landgraf Step One 
At step one of the Landgraf analysis, the question 
is whether Congress has “expressly prescribed the 
statute’s proper reach.” Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280. 
When evaluating Congress’s intent at step one, this 
—————

Rutigliano, 790 F.3d 389, 400 (2d Cir. 2015), the evi-
dence at trial established that Carolyn continued to 
visit Epstein’s residence through 2004. (Tr.1525, 1548-
49; GX-1B; GX-3D through K; see also SA406-07 (Dis-
trict Court summarizing such evidence at sentenc-
ing)). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page46 of 93

Court has considered both statutory text and legisla-
tive history. In re Enter. Mort. Acceptance Co. Sec. 
Litig. (“Enterprise”), 391 F.3d 401, 406-08 (2d Cir. 
2004). Here, the text and history of Section 3283 estab-
lish that Congress intended to extend the time to bring 
charges of child sexual abuse in cases where the limi-
tations period had not yet expired. 
Prior to 2003, any child sex abuse offense could be 
prosecuted until the victim reached the age of 25 years, 
at which point the statute of limitations then in effect 
would bar prosecution. In the 2003 amendment, which 
was titled, “No Statute of Limitations for Child Abduc-
tion and Sex Crimes,” Pub. L. No. 108-21, § 202, 117 
Stat. 660, Congress explicitly provided that “[n]o stat-
ute of limitations that would otherwise preclude pros-
ecution for [such an offense] shall preclude such pros-
ecution during the life of the child.” 18 U.S.C. § 3283 
(2003). The amendment draws no distinction between 
pre-enactment and post-enactment conduct. Instead, 
as Judge Nathan explained, by stating that “no statute 
of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecu-
tion of these offenses will apply,” the amendment’s 
“plain language unambiguously requires that it apply 
to prosecutions for offenses committed before the date 
of enactment.” (A.151). Thus, the breadth of the text 
shows that Congress intended “to extend the . . . stat-
ute of limitations,” even for pre-enactment conduct. 
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir. 
2005) (reaching same conclusion as to § 3283’s prede-
cessor based on similar “title and . . . wording” of stat-
ute); cf. Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 407 (describing provi-
sion that “no limitation shall terminate the period 
within which suit may be filed” as example of statute 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page47 of 93

reflecting clear congressional intent to apply to pre-en-
actment conduct).8 
Legislative history confirms this conclusion. In ini-
tially enacting a special statute of limitations for child 
sex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-
ier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that 
may be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865 
F.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-
adequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, 
at 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-
ample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted” 
because he was “identified . . . as the perpetrator one 
day after the victim turned 25.” Id. Given that Con-
gress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-
tion because the limitations period had expired, there 
is every reason to believe that it intended to preserve 
the ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose 
limitations period had not yet expired. See United 
States v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 2006) 
(concluding that in enacting the 2003 amendment, 
————— 
Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s 
text is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-
looking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-
scribing the application of the 2003 amendment to pre-
enactment conduct. Consider an offense committed 
against a 16-year-old in the year 2000. The statute of 
limitations then in effect indeed “would . . . preclude 
prosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim 
turned twenty-five. The 2003 amendment ensured 
that “[n]o” such “statute of limitations . . . shall pre-
clude such prosecution during the life of the child.” 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page48 of 93

“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the limita-
tions period). 
Maxwell notes that Congress “considered—and re-
jected—a retroactivity clause” before enacting the 
2003 amendment. (Br.55). But as Judge Nathan recog-
nized, “the legislative history makes clear that Con-
gress abandoned the retroactivity provision . . . be-
cause it would have produced unconstitutional re-
sults.” (A.152 (discussing co-sponsor remarks express-
ing concern that “the proposed retroactivity provision 
was ‘of doubtful constitutionality’ because it ‘would 
have revived the government’s authority to prosecute 
crimes that were previously time-barred’ ”)).9 Thus, 
the rejection of the retroactivity clause “shows only 
that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to 
its constitutional applications, including past conduct
—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations 
had not yet expired.” (Id.). 
————— 
Maxwell contests this explanation of the retro-
activity clause’s rejection because Stogner v. Califor-
nia, 539 U.S. 607 (2003), had not yet been decided. 
(Br.56-57). But the co-sponsor could hardly have been 
clearer in expressing his constitutional doubts. And 
the co-sponsor did not need Stogner as a basis for his 
concern, as courts and Congress have long recognized 
the distinction between permissible extensions of un-
expired statutes of limitations and impermissible ex-
tensions of expired statutes of limitations. Stogner, 
539 U.S. at 616-18. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page49 of 93

The reach of the 2003 amendment to Section 3283 
is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the 
statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge 
Nathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf 
step one. In the alternative, however, the statute is—
at worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it 
should proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines 
the retroactive effects of the statute. 
ii. 
Landgraf Step Two 
As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, 
“[e]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-
plying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-
tionably proper in many situations.” 511 U.S. at 273. 
“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-
cause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-
dating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations 
based in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is 
whether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-
sessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for 
past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to 
transactions already completed.” Id. at 280. Im-
portantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-
stituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does 
not make application of the rule at trial retroactive,” 
because parties have “diminished reliance interests in 
matters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-
dure regulate secondary rather than primary con-
duct.” Id. at 275. 
In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., 
F.3d 886 (2d Cir. 1995), this Court considered a new 
statute of limitations that shortened the time to file 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page50 of 93

certain discrimination claims, and held that applying 
the new statute in a case “filed after its enactment, but 
arising out of events that predate its enactment,” is not 
impermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-
90. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the 
statute of limitations applies is not the primary con-
duct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but 
is instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the 
filing of their suit.” Id. at 890. The 2003 amendment to 
Section 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary 
conduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to 
the primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse 
by, for example, modifying the elements of an offense 
to criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-
tuted a crime. See id. at 891 (“Landgraf and other 
cases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-
ferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-
tive rights.”). Thus, like the new statute in Vernon, the 
2003 amendment “impaired no rights possessed by ei-
ther party, increased neither party’s liability, nor im-
posed any new duties with respect to past transac-
tions.” Id. at 890. 
Enterprise does not alter this conclusion. There, 
this Court considered whether an amended statute of 
limitations operated to “revive already expired securi-
ties fraud claims.” Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 405. While 
acknowledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-
cation of a revised statute of limitations generally does 
not have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the 
Court concluded that “the resurrection of previously 
time-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive 
effect.” Id. at 409-10 (emphasis removed). Enterprise 
has no application here, as the limitations period for 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page51 of 93

the charges against Maxwell did not expire before the 
statute of limitations was extended. Thus, unlike En-
terprise, where resurrection of expired claims would 
have “stripp[ed] [defendants] of a complete affirmative 
defense they previously possessed,” id. at 410, here 
Maxwell never possessed that complete defense. Judge 
Nathan correctly concluded that the 2003 amendment 
accordingly “did not deprive [Maxwell] of any vested 
rights.” (A.153). 
To be sure, this Court has observed that there may 
be “colorable arguments” that “the logic of Enterprise 
extends to criminal cases where the defendant’s stat-
ute of limitations defense had not vested when the lim-
itations period was extended” because the extension 
“ ‘increases the period of time during which a defend-
ant can be sued,’ thereby ‘increasing a defendant’s lia-
bility for past conduct.’ ” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57 
(quoting Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 410); see also United 
States v. Miller, 911 F.3d 638, 644-46 (1st Cir. 2018) 
(discussing potential defense arguments). But such a 
claim runs headlong into “the vast weight of retroac-
tivity decisions,” which recognize that “revoking a 
vested statute of limitations defense is different from 
retroactively extending the filing period for a still-via-
ble claim.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57 (collecting 
cases). 
For example, “in the criminal context, there is a 
consensus that extending a limitations period before 
prosecution is time-barred does not run afoul of the Ex 
Post Facto Clause of the Constitution.” Cruz v. Maypa, 
773 F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014); see also Stogner, 539 
U.S. at 632 (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page52 of 93

“does not prevent the State from extending time limits 
for . . . prosecutions not yet time barred”). As this Court 
explained long ago, while it is “unfair and dishonest” 
for the government to “assure a man that he has be-
come safe from its pursuit” but then “withdraw its as-
surance,” it is permissible to extend a statute of limi-
tations “while the chase is on.” Falter v. United States, 
F.2d 420, 426 (2d Cir. 1928) (L. Hand, J.). These ex 
post facto cases are particularly instructive here be-
cause “Landgraf and the Ex Post Facto Clause are in-
formed by the same retroactivity concerns.” Cruz, 773 
F.3d at 145; see also Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 266 (citing 
the Ex Post Facto Clause as an “expression” of “the an-
tiretroactivity principle” it was applying). 
Thus, applying the Section 3283’s 2003 amendment 
to Maxwell’s unexpired charges is permissible under 
Landgraf. As the Tenth Circuit recently explained 
with respect to the very same statute of limitations at 
issue here: 
By extending the unexpired statute of 
limitations, Congress did not increase 
[defendant’s] exposure to prosecution ret-
roactively. It did not raise the penalty for 
the charged offense. It did not redefine 
the offense to make it easier to establish. 
It did not expose [defendant] to criminal 
prosecution anew. It merely altered the 
ongoing charging period for the conduct 
that had already exposed him to criminal 
prosecution. [Defendant] was subject to 
indictment in 2002, before the statutes of 
limitations 
were 
extended, 
and 
he 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page53 of 93

remained subject to indictment in 2007, 
once the changes were made. A dead 
charge was not resurrected, and the un-
derlying nature of [defendant’s] potential 
criminal liability remained the same. 
United States v. Piette, 45 F.4th 1142, 1161-62 (10th 
Cir. 2022). The decisions of other Courts of Appeals are 
in accord. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at 922-25; Jeffries, 405 
F.3d at 685. 
Maxwell cites United States v. Richardson, 512 
F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1975), and two district court deci-
sions that are bound to follow it. (Br.58-59). But Rich-
ardson, which was decided before Landgraf, is “incon-
sistent with Landgraf.” United States v. Nader, 425 F. 
Supp. 3d 619, 630 (E.D. Va. 2019). Specifically, Rich-
ardson focused on whether Congress expressed a 
“clear intention” to overcome the presumption against 
retroactivity, 512 F.2d at 106, without engaging in 
Landgraf ’s second step, i.e., considering whether the 
statute “would have retroactive effect,” Landgraf, 511 
U.S. at 280. Moreover, unlike the 2003 amendment, 
the statute at issue in Richardson did not expressly 
provide that “[n]o statute of limitations that would 
otherwise preclude prosecution” of the relevant offense 
“shall preclude” prosecution under the terms of the 
amended statute. 
In sum, the statute of limitations for the charges in 
the Indictment had not yet expired when the 2003 
amendment to Section 3283 extended the limitations 
period, and Judge Nathan correctly determined that 
applying the 2003 amendment in this case does not 
create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page54 of 93

step two of Landgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 ap-
plies retroactively. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 55 (“If 
[a statute] would not [create impermissible retroactive 
effects], then the court shall apply the statute to ante-
cedent conduct.”). Accordingly, the charges were 
timely.10 
2. Section 3283 Reaches Counts Three and 
Four 
Maxwell separately argues that Section 3283 does 
not apply to Counts Three and Four because neither is 
an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse . . . 
of a child.” Maxwell contends that these counts, which 
charged her with transporting a minor with intent 
that the minor engage in illegal sexual activity and 
conspiracy to do the same, are not offenses involving 
the sexual abuse of a child because a completed sex act 
is not an essential element of either charge. But Max-
well does not dispute that the evidence at trial estab-
lished that her commission of Counts Three and Four 
involved completed sex acts abusing one or more minor 
victims. Nor could she, as Jane testified that she was 
————— 
As the Government argued below, and as Judge 
Nathan found, Count Six is also timely under 18 
U.S.C. § 3299, which eliminated the statute of limita-
tions for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 in 2006, and 
which also applies retroactively under Landgraf for 
the same reasons discussed above with respect to Sec-
tion 3283. (A.196 (concluding that, “like § 3283, § 3299 
applies retroactively to offenses for which the previous 
limitations period has not yet run”)). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page55 of 93

in fact sexually abused when transported across state 
lines, including to New York, as a minor. Instead, Max-
well insists that Counts Three and Four do not involve 
sexual abuse of a child because a completed sex act is 
not an element of those crimes. This argument mis-
reads the relevant statutes and legislative history, and 
runs contrary to the decisions of this Court and other 
Courts of Appeals.11 
a. 
Counts Three and Four Are Offenses 
Involving the Sexual Abuse of a 
Child 
Maxwell’s entire argument is based on a mistaken 
premise: that the phrase “offense involving the sexual 
. . . abuse . . . of a child,” 18 U.S.C. § 3283, only encom-
passes crimes in which “unlawful sexual activity actu-
ally took place.” (Br.44). This flawed proposition ig-
nores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear 
that Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include of-
fenses in which there was no completed illegal sex act. 
As described above, Section 3283 was originally 
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k). The definition of the 
term “sexual abuse” is located within that same sec-
tion: 
For purposes of this section . . . the term 
‘sexual abuse’ includes the employment, 
use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, 
————— 
Maxwell raises no analogous argument with re-
spect to Count Six, which charges sex trafficking of a 
minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page56 of 93

or coercion of a child to engage in, or as-
sist another person to engage in, sexually 
explicit conduct or the rape, molestation, 
prostitution, or other form of sexual ex-
ploitation of children, or incest with chil-
dren. 
U.S.C. § 3509(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit con-
duct” is in turn defined to mean, among other things, 
“sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the 
term “sexual contact” means “the intentional touching, 
either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, 
anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any per-
son with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, de-
grade, or arouse or gratify sexual desire of any person.” 
Id. § 3509(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the defini-
tion of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 3509(a) to 
determine whether the statute of limitations of Section 
3283 applies to an offense. United States v. Carpenter, 
680 F.3d 1101, 1103-04 (9th Cir. 2012) (“We join our 
sister circuits in looking to subsection 3509(a) for a def-
inition of ‘sexual abuse’ under federal law, and find it 
the appropriate definition to use in applying section 
3283’s extended statute of limitations.”). 
The definition of “sexual abuse” includes not only 
actual “sexual contact,” but also the “the employment, 
use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion 
of a child to engage in, or assist another person to en-
gage in,” sexual contact. 18 U.S.C. § 3509(a). The 
breadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s 
use of the word “includes” in Section 3509(a)’s text, 
which is “significant because it makes clear that the 
examples enumerated in the text are intended to be 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page57 of 93

illustrative, 
not 
exhaustive.” 
Christopher 
v. 
SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 162 (2012) 
(citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. 124, 131 n.3 
(2008)). And the text of Section 3283 goes even further 
beyond the definition provided in Section 3509 by cov-
ering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child. 
Congress therefore did not require that a particular 
statute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an 
element of its offense, but rather swept broadly to 
cover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse 
as broadly defined. Given this expansive language, 
sexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set 
of behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual 
touching.” United States v. Schneider, 801 F.3d 186, 
197 (3d Cir. 2015). Thus, courts throughout the coun-
try have concluded that Section 3283 applies to a vari-
ety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-
tween a defendant and a specific child,” United States 
v. Vickers, No. 13 Cr. 128 (RJA), 2014 WL 1838255, at 
*11 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014), or “physical contact with 
the victim,” Carpenter, 680 F.3d at 1103; accord 
United States v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 714, 720 (5th Cir. 
2015). 
Section 3283’s definition thus captures crimes of in-
tent where a perpetrator seeks to have a minor engage 
in sexual contact even if such sexual contact does not 
occur. Transportation of a minor with intent to engage 
in an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and 
conspiracy to commit the same (as charged in Count 
Three) fall comfortably within that definition. Even 
though a completed sex act is not required to commit 
those two crimes, Count Four has “sexual abuse” as an 
element because it requires the defendant to 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page58 of 93

“induce[ ]” a child to engage in illegal sexual activity 
by transporting the minor across state lines with in-
tent that the child engage in an illegal sex act, 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(a)(8), and Count Three, as a conspiracy 
to commit Count Four, is an “offense involving [such] 
sexual . . . abuse,” id. § 3283. See United States v. 
Sensi, No. 08 Cr. 253 (WWE), 2010 WL 2351484, at *2-
(D. Conn. June 7, 2010) (collecting cases interpreting 
the term “sexual abuse” to encompass “all crimes that 
would logically relate to the common understanding of 
sexual abuse even when found in chapters 110 (‘Sexual 
Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and 117 
(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related 
Crimes’) of title 18”); Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196-97 
(holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant con-
victed of traveling with the purpose of engaging in sex 
with a minor victim, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2423(b)). 
Accordingly, even considering only the elements of 
the offenses, Counts Three and Four fall squarely 
within Section 3283’s definition of an offense involving 
sexual abuse of a child. 
b. 
Maxwell’s Argument for Use of a 
Categorical Approach Lacks Merit 
Because Counts Three and Four qualify as “of-
fense[s] involving the sexual . . . abuse . . . of a child,” 
U.S.C. § 3283, even without resort to the facts of the 
case, the Court need not address Maxwell’s claim that 
the categorical approach applies in this context. But 
the arguments Maxwell advances in support of her 
claim are meritless in any event. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page59 of 93

Maxwell first relies on Section 3283’s use of the 
phrase “offense involving” the sexual abuse of a child, 
which, she contends, “dictates” looking only to the ele-
ments of the offense. (Br.43). But as this Court has al-
ready recognized, Section 3283’s text “reaches beyond 
the offense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘in-
volv[ed]’ in the offense”—a “linguistic expansion” that 
shows Congress’s intent for “courts to look beyond the 
bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 ap-
plied.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59-60; see also Nijha-
wan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (holding that 
a statute that includes an “offense . . . involves” phrase 
is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach”). 
Indeed, the Third Circuit has expressly rejected an 
“ ‘essential ingredient’ test” comparable to the categor-
ical approach and instead applied case-specific analy-
sis to determine that Section 3283 applied to travel 
with intent to commit an illegal sex act with a minor, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b). Schneider, 801 F.3d 
at 196-97. 
Maxwell also argues that “the clear weight of au-
thority” holds that statutes employing similar lan-
guage “should be read through a categorical rather 
than case-specific lens.” (Br.44-45). But the decisions 
she cites involved statutes with other features favoring 
the categorical approach, which are notably absent 
here. Some cases involved statutes that defined a 
“crime of violence” as an offense that either “has as an 
element” the use of physical force or “by its nature” in-
volves a substantial risk of force—language that in-
vokes an elements-based approach. United States v. 
Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2328-29 (2019); Leocal v. Ash-
croft, 543 U.S. 1, 7 (2004). Some cases concerned the 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page60 of 93

definition of an “aggravated felony” under federal im-
migration law, Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478 
(2012); Leocal, 543 U.S. at 7, a context in which the 
categorical approach traditionally applies because the 
inquiry is whether the alien’s prior conviction meets 
the definition. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59. And United 
States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192 (D.C. Cir. 2004), is like-
wise distinguishable, as it “involved a venue statute 
presenting significantly different concerns” than those 
present here. (A.148). 
Maxwell also relies on a trio of cases, chief among 
them Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953). 
(Br.45-47). In Bridges, the Supreme Court “applied an 
‘essential ingredient’ test to determine whether an of-
fense qualified for a provision . . . that extended the 
criminal limitations period for certain fraud offenses.” 
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 n.10. But as this Court has 
explained, “Bridges is distinguishable” because the Su-
preme Court “there believed applying the restrictive 
‘essential ingredient’ test to determine if an offense ‘in-
volv[ed] the defrauding of the United States’ effectu-
ated Congress’s specific intent to limit the . . . extended 
limitations period to only a few offenses,” while “Con-
gress had the opposite intention for § 3283.” Id. The 
other two cases, United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 
518 (1932), and United States v. Noveck, 271 U.S. 201 
(1926), are distinguishable on similar grounds. In any 
event, the “essential ingredient” test does not help 
Maxwell. As discussed above, an “offense involving the 
sexual . . . abuse . . . of a child,” 18 U.S.C. § 3283, must 
be read in light of the definition of “sexual abuse” set 
forth in Section 3509(a), which encompasses a wide 
range of conduct that is not limited to actual sexual 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page61 of 93

contact with a child. Counts Three and Four each have 
an “essential ingredient” that fits within that broad 
definition. See supra Point II.B.2.a. 
Finally, neither Diehl nor United States v. Coun-
tentos, 651 F.3d 809 (8th Cir. 2011), supports the use 
of a categorical approach. (Br.51-52). In each decision, 
the court concluded that Section 3283 applied to the 
subject offenses without considering the specific facts 
of the crime, but in neither case did the court consider 
whether a categorical approach was required—let 
alone hold that it was. 
As noted above, it is undisputed that the evidence 
at trial established that Maxwell’s commission of 
Counts Three and Four involved completed sex acts 
abusing one or more minor victims: Jane testified that 
she was in fact sexually abused when transported 
across state lines, including to New York, as a minor. 
Accordingly, Counts Three and Four qualify as of-
fenses involving the sexual abuse of a child both by 
their statutory terms and based on the specific facts of 
this case. 
POINT III 
The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in 
Concluding that Juror 50 Could Be Fair and 
Impartial Notwithstanding His Inadvertent 
Mistakes on His Juror Questionnaire 
Maxwell contends that she was denied her right to 
a fair and impartial jury because a juror failed to dis-
close during voir dire that he was sexually abused as a 
child, and therefore incorrectly answered three 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page62 of 93

questions on his written questionnaire. After an exten-
sive hearing, Judge Nathan concluded that the juror’s 
error was inadvertent, and in any event, she would not 
have struck the juror for cause had he answered those 
question accurately because he was not biased in any 
way against Maxwell and was qualified to serve as a 
juror. Judge Nathan therefore found that Maxwell 
failed to meet the high bar for a new trial and denied 
her motion. This Court should affirm that careful de-
termination. 
A. Relevant Facts 
1. The Jury Selection Process 
In November 2021, in advance of trial, 694 jurors 
completed a juror questionnaire approved by the Dis-
trict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror questionnaire 
was 29 pages and consisted of 51 questions, many of 
which contained subparts. (A.290-317). After the par-
ties reviewed the questionnaires, 231 of the 694 pro-
ceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court 
then examined prospective jurors, asking them about 
questions in the jury questionnaire that prospective 
jurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court 
asked the prospective jurors whether the information 
or experiences resulting in the affirmative answer 
would interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-
tial. 
At the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court 
qualified 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.717). Of the 58 indi-
viduals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight in-
dividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-
tionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page63 of 93

sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, 
and that this experience would not affect their ability 
to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.12 
(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.18, 52, 200, 207, 259, 293, 532, 
538-39, 635). Each confirmed that he or she could be 
fair and impartial, and defense counsel did not move 
to strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer 
to Question 48. (A.345). 
For instance, one juror said that she was “sexually 
molested by an uncle when she was 12 or 13,” but that 
would not affect her ability to be fair and impartial in 
the case. (A.345). Another juror indicated that she had 
recently “reported that a friend was being coerced and 
sexually abused by a professor,” but confirmed that ex-
perience would not “in any way interfere with her abil-
ity to be fair and impartial” in this case. (Id.). Neither 
the Government nor defense counsel challenged those 
jurors for cause. 
The parties then exercised their peremptory 
strikes, and a jury was seated. 
2. Juror 50 
Juror 50 completed the questionnaire and was 
questioned by Judge Nathan during voir dire. In his 
questionnaire, Juror 50 repeatedly made clear that he 
could be fair and impartial. In response to Question 13, 
————— 
Twelve of the 58 qualified prospective jurors in-
dicated that a friend or family member had been a vic-
tim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual as-
sault. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page64 of 93

he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely 
on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, 
and not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-
pathy, or prejudice.” (A.295). He also accepted the 
principle that the law provides that a defendant in a 
criminal case is presumed innocent and the Govern-
ment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt. (A.294). Juror 50 indicated that there was noth-
ing about the nature of the case and the accusations as 
summarized in the questionnaire that might make it 
difficult for him to be fair and impartial. (A.308; see 
also A.310). He repeated these assurances at oral voir 
dire. (See Voir Dire Tr.128-34). 
Juror 50 checked the “no” box in response to Ques-
tion 48, which asked whether he or a friend or family 
member had ever been the victim of sexual harass-
ment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. (A.310). He also 
checked the “no” box in response to the question of 
whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had 
ever been a victim of a crime. (A.299). 
Juror 50 was seated. Following the verdict, he dis-
cussed his experience as a juror during interviews with 
multiple journalists. During these interviews, Juror 50 
stated that he was a survivor of childhood sexual 
abuse, which he did not disclose until high school, and 
that his experience of sexual abuse did not affect his 
ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven 
guilty. (A.249). He also stated that he did not recall the 
details of the juror questionnaire, which he “flew 
through,” but he believed he answered the questions 
honestly. (A.245, 262). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page65 of 93

3. The Hearing 
Following these reports, the Government filed a let-
ter highlighting Juror 50’s public statements and re-
questing that the District Court conduct a hearing. 
(Dkt.568). After briefing, Judge Nathan ordered a lim-
ited hearing focused on Juror 50’s “potential failure to 
respond truthfully to questions during the jury selec-
tion process that asked for that material information.” 
(A.240; SA350). Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s re-
quest to directly question Juror 50, which was “com-
mitted to [her] sound discretion,” but permitted the 
parties to propose questions in advance of the hearing. 
(SA364 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 
667 (2d Cir. 1978)). The parties did so—and Maxwell 
submitted a letter renewing her request to question 
Juror 50 directly and proposing twenty-one pages of 
questions on topics including the nature and length of 
Juror 50’s sexual abuse, the nature of the sexual abuse 
experienced by any of Juror 50’s family or friends, his 
own employment responsibilities, the impact of his 
sexual abuse on his life and personal relationships, 
whether Juror 50 ever sought mental health counsel-
ing or spoke with a therapist, how he came to give me-
dia interviews, and whether he was attempting to be 
viewed as a “champion of victims of sexual abuse.” 
(Dkt.636). 
The District Court held a hearing on March 8, 2022, 
at which Juror 50 testified under a grant of immunity. 
Juror 50 testified that his answers to three questions 
were not accurate: Questions 25 (whether he or a close 
associate had been a victim of a crime), 48 (whether he 
or a friend or family member had been a victim of 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page66 of 93

sexual harassment or abuse), and 49 (whether he or a 
friend or family member had been accused of sexual 
harassment or abuse). He explained that, when he was 
nine or ten years old, he was sexually abused by a step-
brother, who he no longer considered part of the fam-
ily, and the stepbrother’s friend. He explained that he 
answered Question 49 “no” because he no longer con-
sidered the stepbrother part of his family, although he 
should have answered “yes.” He also acknowledged 
that he should have answered “yes” to Question 25 be-
cause he was a crime victim, although he read the 
question at the time to inquire about robbery, mug-
ging, or similar crimes. (A.267-68). 
Juror 50 also testified that his failure to disclose 
this experience was an inadvertent mistake. He ex-
plained that he “completely skimmed way too fast” 
when completing the questionnaire. (A.270-71). He did 
so, he explained, in light of the context: he started the 
questionnaire after several hours’ waiting in security 
lines and after technical issues with the instructions. 
He was preoccupied with his own recent romantic 
breakup and with disruptions in the jury room. And he 
rushed to complete his questionnaire because he 
thought it virtually impossible that he would be se-
lected as a juror given the number of people complet-
ing the questionnaire. He did not generally think 
about his personal history of sexual abuse, and it did 
not occur to him while carelessly speeding through the 
questionnaire. (A.269-72). 
At oral voir dire, Juror 50 had not been asked the 
questions Judge Nathan posed to prospective jurors 
who answered affirmatively to questions 25, 48, or 49, 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page67 of 93

and therefore was not asked any questions about sex-
ual abuse. At the hearing, Judge Nathan examined Ju-
ror 50 in detail, and Juror 50 emphasized that his ex-
periences did not affect his ability to be fair and impar-
tial, his ability to fairly assess the credibility of victim-
witnesses, or his ability to impartially judge Maxwell’s 
guilt. (A.268, 270, 276-77). 
4. The District Court’s Decision 
Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s motion for a new 
trial in a detailed written opinion. (A.318). First, 
Judge Nathan concluded that Juror 50’s answers were 
not deliberately inaccurate, crediting Juror 50’s testi-
mony in light of his demeanor and consistent, logical 
answers to her questions. (A.333-35). Second, Judge 
Nathan concluded that she would not have granted a 
for-cause challenge to Juror 50 had he provided accu-
rate information. At the hearing, Judge Nathan asked 
Juror 50 the questions she asked other jurors who in-
dicated a personal experience with sexual assault or 
abuse. She concluded that “Juror 50’s credible re-
sponses [to those questions] under oath at the hearing 
established that he would not have been struck for 
cause if he had provided accurate responses to the 
questionnaire.” (A.340). As Judge Nathan explained, 
other jurors who answered the questions similarly 
were not even challenged for cause, and she would not 
have granted a challenge had one been made. (A.344-
45). She also rejected the notion that mere similarities 
between Juror 50’s life experiences and the issues at 
trial required her to excuse Juror 50 for cause. (A.346). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page68 of 93

B. Applicable Law 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) permits 
a district court to “vacate any judgment and grant a 
new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” As this 
Court has explained, “[t]he defendant bears the bur-
den of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under 
Rule 33, and before ordering a new trial pursuant to 
Rule 33, a district court must find that there is a real 
concern that an innocent person may have been con-
victed.” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 
(2d Cir. 2009). 
Post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct are 
strongly disfavored. Such inquiries “seriously disrupt 
the finality of the process.” Tanner v. United States, 
483 U.S. 107, 120-21 (1987). Permitting “post-verdict 
scrutiny of juror conduct” would undermine pillars 
that undergird the jury trial right, including “full and 
frank discussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness 
to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s 
trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeo-
ple.” Id. Such inquiries may instead “lead to evil con-
sequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting 
juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with merit-
less applications, increasing temptation for jury tam-
pering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.” 
United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 
1989). 
Accordingly, a defendant seeking Rule 33 relief 
based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir 
dire must satisfy a stringent two-part test. First, a 
party must “demonstrate that a juror failed to answer 
honestly a material question on voir dire.” McDonough 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page69 of 93

Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 
(1984). Second, the party must show “that a correct re-
sponse would have provided a valid basis for a chal-
lenge for cause.” Id. To satisfy this prong, a court must 
determine whether, if the juror had answered truth-
fully, it would have granted a hypothetical strike for 
cause. United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 304 (2d 
Cir. 2006). 
A party may challenge a juror for cause based only 
on “narrowly specified, provable and legally cognizable 
bases.” United States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 
1997). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause 
generally fall into one of three “limited” categories: ac-
tual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Id. “Actual 
bias is bias in fact—the existence of a state of mind 
that leads to an inference that the person will not act 
with entire impartiality.” Id. Implied bias, also called 
“presumed bias,” is “bias conclusively presumed as a 
matter of law.” Id. at 45. This Court has emphasized 
that this category is “narrow,” and “reserved for ‘ex-
ceptional situations,’ ” generally meaning circum-
stances in which jurors “are related to the parties” or 
“were victims of the alleged crime itself.” Id. at 45-46. 
Finally, “[b]ias may be inferred when a juror discloses 
a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently sig-
nificant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion 
to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to 
make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Id. at 46-47. 
Where there are concrete allegations of juror mis-
conduct, a court may conduct a post-verdict hearing. 
See United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 
2018). The inquiry “should be limited to only what is 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page70 of 93

absolutely necessary to determine the facts with preci-
sion.” Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “[T]he proper func-
tioning of the jury system requires that the courts pro-
tect jurors from being harassed and beset by the de-
feated party in an effort to secure from them evidence 
of facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to 
set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664. Accord-
ingly, the district court “has the power and the duty to 
supervise and closely control such inquiries.” United 
States v. Calbas, 821 F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. 1987). For 
example, the district court may choose to personally 
conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid in-
truding on the jury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 
821 F.2d at 896. At such a hearing, and with limited 
exceptions, the juror “may not testify about any state-
ment made or incident that occurred during the jury’s 
deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or 
another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes 
concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may 
not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s 
statement on these matters.” Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1). 
This Court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion 
for abuse of discretion. United States v. Archer, 977 
F.3d 181, 187 (2d Cir. 2020). A district court only 
abuses its discretion if its decision “rests on an error of 
law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) 
or a clearly erroneous factual finding” or “its decision 
. . . cannot be located within the range of permissible 
decisions.” Id. This Court “has only on rare occasions 
overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary 
hearing” based on the failure of a juror to disclose in-
formation during jury selection. United States v. Te-
man, 465 F. Supp. 3d 277, 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).

C. Discussion 
Judge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and 
determined that Juror 50’s inadvertent errors on the 
jury questionnaire did not undermine Maxwell’s right 
to a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage 
with Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-
ing that Juror 50’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-
tently absurd.” (Br.63). These conclusory arguments 
fall far short of establishing that Judge Nathan abused 
her discretion in finding that this case does not present 
the extraordinary circumstances that justify overturn-
ing a jury’s verdict based on an error during voir dire. 
Maxwell’s claim fails at the first step of 
McDonough because Juror 50’s errors were inadvert-
ent. Juror 50 testified as much at the hearing, provid-
ing a detailed narrative of why his errors were a fail-
ure of diligence as he rushed through the question-
naire while distracted. (A.333-34). Judge Nathan cred-
ited this explanation in light of his demeanor, which 
she “closely observe[d]” as he testified, including dur-
ing his answers to questions “he appeared not to ex-
pect.” (A.333). She explained that his answers were 
“logical explanations and generally internally con-
sistent,” given in a “calm and straightforward man-
ner.” (Id.). Juror 50’s explanations were consistent 
with “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir 
dire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history 
was not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.” 
(Id.). Judge Nathan also noted that Juror 50’s answers 
aligned with his incentives: by testifying under a grant 
of immunity, he could not be prosecuted for his false 
answers on the questionnaire, but he could be 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page72 of 93

prosecuted for false testimony at the hearing (id.), and 
had he hidden his sexual abuse in order to get on the 
jury, he would not have immediately disclosed it to the 
media after trial (A.335). To the contrary, in one video 
interview with the media, Juror 50 “appears genuinely 
and completely surprised to learn that the question-
naire” asked about his history of sexual abuse. (Id.). 
Maxwell does not directly challenge Judge Na-
than’s factual findings on this point, much less demon-
strate that they are clearly erroneous. Instead, relying 
on United States v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 
1993), Maxwell argues that McDonough’s first step is 
satisfied by any falsehood, deliberate or otherwise. 
(Br.66). 
This argument misses the mark. This prong re-
quires a showing of deliberate dishonesty by the juror, 
rather than mere honest mistake. This Court has ex-
plained that, in McDonough, the Supreme Court 
“found that the juror’s good faith failure to respond, 
though mistaken, did not satisfy even the first prong 
of the test.” United States v. Shaoul, 41 F.3d 811, 815 
(2d Cir. 1994). The defendant in Shaoul also relied on 
Langford to contend that a new trial was appropriate 
“even if he cannot establish the juror’s dishonesty.” Id. 
This Court rejected that argument, concluding that 
“[s]uch a contorted reading of Langford is incorrect, be-
cause it would eliminate the threshold requirement of 
the McDonough test: juror dishonesty.” Id. And this 
Court concluded that the defendant failed to satisfy 
the first prong of the test because “defense counsel ex-
plicitly conceded the good faith of the juror.” Id. at 816; 
see United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32, 51 (2d Cir. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page73 of 93

2021) (holding that district court “properly recognized 
that the initial question to be explored is whether the 
juror’s nondisclosure was deliberate or inadvertent”), 
vacated on other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 2863 (2022), rein-
stated, 58 F.4th 72, 75 (2d Cir. 2023). 
Maxwell’s claim also fails at the second step of 
McDonough. The hearing established that Juror 50 
harbored no bias, approached his jury service with an 
open mind, and was committed to deciding the case 
based on the evidence and the District Court’s legal in-
structions. As Judge Nathan found, “Juror 50’s credi-
ble responses [to questions asked of all jurors who in-
dicated prior personal experience with sexual abuse] 
under oath at the hearing established that he would 
not have been struck for cause if he had provided ac-
curate responses to the questionnaire.” (A.340). If Ju-
ror 50 had accurately answered the questions relating 
to sexual abuse in the questionnaire, Judge Nathan 
would have asked Juror 50 follow-up questions during 
voir dire to determine if it would have granted a chal-
lenge for cause. Judge Nathan asked those questions 
at the hearing, and Juror 50’s sworn responses made 
clear that he was a fair and impartial juror who did 
not harbor any bias and who would not have been ex-
cused for cause. 
Nor was Juror 50 the subject of any bias, actual, 
implied, or inferred. After assessing Juror 50’s de-
meanor, Judge Nathan found that he “repeatedly and 
credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual 
abuse would not affect his ability to serve as a fair and 
impartial juror ‘in any way’ ” (A.341-42), belying any 
suggestion that he was actually biased against 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page74 of 93

Maxwell. Judge Nathan also correctly rejected Max-
well’s “central argument” that she should imply or in-
fer bias “based on the purported similarities between 
[Juror 50’s] personal history and the issues at trial.” 
(A.342-43). Judge Nathan explained that she “need not 
imagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that 
conclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every 
follow-up question requested by the Defendant with 
regard to a juror’s personal experience with sexual as-
sault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority 
of these eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose 
any follow-up questions.” (A.344-45). One prospective 
juror described her own childhood sexual abuse at an 
age closer to the victims in this case; another described 
a friend’s recent coercive sexual abuse by a professor. 
(A.345). Maxwell did not even bring a for-cause chal-
lenge as to either. (Id.). Similarly, a for-cause chal-
lenge against Juror 50 would not have prevailed. 
On appeal, Maxwell contends that, had Juror 50 
answered the questionnaire accurately, it “clearly” 
would have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.” 
(Br.67). In particular, Maxwell challenges Judge Na-
than’s finding that Juror 50 was credible and unbi-
ased, relying on a few isolated statements drawn from 
various parts of the hearing transcript and some of his 
post-verdict statements. (Br.71-72). As described 
above, Judge Nathan explained how Juror 50’s expla-
nation for his erroneous answers was plausible and 
consistent, and she found him credible after assessing 
his demeanor through challenging questioning. She 
also properly disregarded his post-verdict statements 
about the case, explaining that “[a] juror’s view of a 
case and defendant would necessarily change after 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page75 of 93

reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded 
twelve jurors of the Defendant’s guilt.” (A.352). Actual 
and inferred bias are both committed to the province 
of the trial judge, and Judge Nathan’s findings that 
neither existed were not clearly erroneous. See Torres, 
128 F.3d at 44 (“[A] finding of actual bias is based upon 
determinations of demeanor and credibility that are 
peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”); United 
States v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, 172 (2d Cir. 2002) (“[A] 
finding of inferred bias is, by definition, within the dis-
cretion of the trial court.”). 
Maxwell also argues that Judge Nathan should 
have implied bias, highlighting some similarities be-
tween Juror 50’s sexual abuse and the sexual abuse 
discussed at trial. (Br.67). That falls far short of re-
quiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as 
Judge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must 
be implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-
ilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court 
has “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-
bly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused 
for cause due to certain occupational or other special 
relationships which might bear directly or indirectly 
on the circumstances of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting 
Torres, 128 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of 
the rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory 
presumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, 128 F.3d 
at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at 172. Second, although there 
are some similarities between Juror 50’s childhood 
sexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 50 was 
younger than the trial victims at the time of their 
abuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-
closed his abuse much earlier. (A.350). And critically, 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page76 of 93

Juror 50 credibly testified at the hearing that he was 
able to put aside his experience of sexual abuse and 
judge the evidence fairly. This is not the sort of “ex-
treme situation that call[s] for mandatory removal.” 
(A.349 (quoting Torres, 128 F.3d at 46)). 
More generally, it is entirely appropriate for jurors 
to “rely on their common sense and life experiences to 
adjudge guilt.” (A.352). These “very human elements 
. . . constitute one of the strengths of our jury system, 
and we cannot and should not excommunicate them 
from jury deliberations.” (A.353 (quoting United States 
ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 813, 818 (2d Cir. 
1970)). On these facts, “[t]o imply or infer that Juror 
was biased—simply because he was himself a vic-
tim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse 
and sex trafficking, and despite his own credible testi-
mony under the penalty of perjury, establishing that 
he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—
would be tantamount to concluding that an individual 
with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair 
and impartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, 
nor should it be.” (A.346-47). 
Finally, Maxwell suggests that Judge Nathan 
abused her discretion by precluding defense counsel 
from questioning Juror 50, and precluding inquiry into 
Juror 50’s “statements to journalists.” (Br.70). As to 
the former, the manner in which the hearing proceeds 
is committed to a district court’s “sound discretion,” 
Moten, 582 F.2d at 666, including specifically the “ex-
tent to which the parties may participate in question-
ing the witnesses,” Iannielo, 866 F.2d at 544. Judge 
Nathan reasonably decided to lead the questioning 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page77 of 93

herself, with repeated opportunities both before and 
during the hearing for counsel to suggest questions. 
And Judge Nathan’s decision is reinforced by counsel’s 
requests for “vexatious, intrusive, unjustified” subpoe-
nas (SA365), and for questions that swept well beyond 
Juror 50’s ability to be an impartial juror and instead 
probed deeply into “other aspects of his life” (Br.69). 
As to Juror 50’s “statements to journalists,” it is not 
entirely clear which statements Maxwell thinks 
should have been part of the hearing. The hearing of 
course covered both the substance of his sexual abuse 
and the fact of his statements to journalists. (See, e.g., 
A.275 (asking whether Juror 50 understood “from your 
interviews that the fact that you were abused would be 
a known fact in the world.”)). It appears that, in Max-
well’s view, Judge Nathan should have inquired into 
whether and how his sexual abuse affected the delib-
erations in the jury room. (Br.71 (suggesting that Ju-
ror 50 “operate[d] as an unsworn expert on the subject 
of traumatic memory”)). Acknowledging Rule 606(b)’s 
prohibition on inquiry into jurors’ deliberations and 
mental processes, Maxwell argues that the exception 
for “extraneous prejudicial information [that] was im-
properly brought to the jury’s attention,” Fed. R. Evid. 
606(b)(2)(A), applies here. (Br.71). But Maxwell ex-
pressly waived this argument in the District Court, ex-
plaining that she “[d]oes not seek to impeach the ver-
dict based on the content of deliberations” and “need 
not inquire into the content of deliberations to estab-
lish her jury bias claim.” (Dkt.613 at 49-50). And in 
any event, the exception does not apply because the 
“experiences that jurors are understood to bring with 
them to the jury room” are “internal matters” that do 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page78 of 93

not constitute “extraneous” information. Warger v. 
Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 51-52 (2014) (rejecting party’s 
attempt to use the “extraneous” information exception 
to establish that a juror should have been excluded un-
der McDonough based on his personal experiences). 
POINT IV 
The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did 
Not Constructively Amend the Indictment 
At all times the Government consistently argued 
that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to New 
York with the intent that Jane engage in illegal sexual 
activity, and that Maxwell conspired to do so regarding 
Jane and the other victims. That is the issue Judge 
Nathan instructed the jury to resolve, and that is the 
criminal conduct charged in Counts Three and Four of 
the Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive amend-
ment or variance occurred. 
A. Relevant Facts 
Counts Three and Four charged Maxwell with ar-
ranging for Jane’s transportation to New York with 
the intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Ep-
stein, in violation of New York state law, and with a 
conspiracy to transport minors to New York for the 
same purpose. (A.127-30). At trial, the Government 
marshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to 
New York, and aided and abetted Epstein in doing so, 
with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity 
there. That evidence included detailed testimony from 
Jane about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr.316-19) 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page79 of 93

and specific sexual acts that took place in New York 
while Jane was a minor (Tr.319-20). 
The Government’s summation similarly discussed 
these charges as encompassing conduct directed at 
New York. As to Count Four, the Government argued 
the evidence showed “Jane was transported to New 
York,” and Maxwell was involved in making travel ar-
rangements. (Tr.2891 (emphasis added)). The Govern-
ment also clarified that “[t]he crime happened the mo-
ment [Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane] crossed state 
lines,” and “to be very clear, when Epstein flew Jane to 
New York and Maxwell aided and abetted him, that’s 
enough too.” (Id. (emphasis added)). For the conspiracy 
counts, the Government referenced its earlier discus-
sion of the elements of the substantive offenses. And 
the Government argued that, “even though Carolyn 
and Annie were not sexually abused in New York . . . 
that is what [Maxwell and Epstein] both intended.” 
(Tr.2895 (emphasis added); see Tr.2895-96 (arguing 
that Maxwell “groomed Annie for abuse after she had 
already visited Epstein in New York.” (emphasis 
added))). 
The District Court’s jury instructions also permit-
ted the jury to determine only whether Maxwell had 
intended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the 
conspiracy victims engage in sexual activity in New 
York. During trial, Judge Nathan granted defense re-
quests for limiting instructions at the time evidence 
came in to make clear that the charges focused on the 
intent that sexual activity take place in New York. 
(Tr.1167-68 (Kate), 2048-49 (Annie)). At the conclusion 
of trial, Judge Nathan instructed the jury that Count 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page80 of 93

Four alleged that Maxwell knowingly transported 
Jane “with the intent that Jane engage in sexual ac-
tivity for which any person can be charged with a crim-
inal offense in violation of New York law.” (Tr.3037; 
see Tr.3035 (second element of Count Four requires 
proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged 
in the indictment”)). Judge Nathan also instructed the 
jury on one and only one predicate state offense: a vio-
lation of N.Y. Penal Law § 130.55. (Tr.3034, 3037). The 
instructions on Count Three incorporated this discus-
sion of the elements of Count Four, and the only stat-
ute identified was N.Y. Penal Law § 130.55. (Tr.3049-
50, 3056-57). 
During deliberations, the jury sent the following 
note: 
Under Count Four, if the defendant aided 
in the transportation of Jane’s return 
flight, but not the flight to New Mexico 
where/if the intent was for Jane to en-
gage in sexual activity, can she be found 
guilty under the second element? 
(Tr.3126). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the 
conclusion of which Judge Nathan determined she 
should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the 
second element of Count Four because the jury note 
was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-
gally.” (Tr.3126-40). 
That night, Maxwell filed a letter seeking reconsid-
eration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the 
possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial 
variance because, in her view, the note showed that 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page81 of 93

the jury might convict based on Jane’s testimony that 
she was abused in New Mexico. (A.224-25). Maxwell 
asked Judge Nathan to instruct the jury as to the in-
tent elements of Counts Two and Four, and add that 
“[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any 
state other than New York cannot form the basis of 
these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (A.229). 
Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s request both be-
cause the jury did not inquire about Count Two and 
because the final sentence as “just wrong” in suggest-
ing that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity 
outside of New York “may have no relevance.” 
(Tr.3149). As Judge Nathan explained, “This is the 
same discussion we’ve had a couple of times . . . . Sex-
ual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under 
the age of 17 can be relevant to an intent to transport 
to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age 
of 17 . . . .” (Tr.3149-50). Judge Nathan repeated that 
she did “not know how to parse the jury’s question ex-
actly,” but that her instruction directing the jury to the 
original charge included a reminder that “it’s a viola-
tion of New York penal law that’s charged and is the 
illegal sexual activity that they’re considering.” 
(Tr.3150). Judge Nathan also pointed out that Max-
well did not “seek to exclude” Jane’s testimony about 
New Mexico, or “seek a limiting instruction with re-
spect to that testimony.” (Tr.3153). Judge Nathan 
added “I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking 
or many other plausible readings,” noted that the de-
fense had proposed an “incorrect” instruction, and con-
cluded no more was required than sending the jury 
“back to the charge.” (Tr.3154).

B. Applicable Law 
“A constructive amendment occurs when the 
charge upon which the defendant is tried differs sig-
nificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury 
voted.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 
(2d Cir. 2021). “Not every alteration of an indictment, 
however, rises to the level of a constructive amend-
ment.” United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146 (2d 
Cir. 2018). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive 
amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that 
the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the 
presentation of evidence and jury instructions which 
so modify essential elements of the offense that there is 
a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have 
been convicted of an offense other than that charged in 
the indictment.” United States v. D’Amelio, 693 F.3d 
412, 416 (2d Cir. 2012). 
This Court has “consistently permitted significant 
flexibility in proof, provided that the defendant was 
given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at 
trial.” United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 53 (2d 
Cir. 2019). The “core of criminality” is “the essence of 
a crime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of 
how a defendant effected the crime.” D’Amelio, 693 
F.3d at 418. There is no constructive amendment 
where the allegations in the indictment and the proof 
at trial both relate to a “single set of discrete facts,” or 
form “part of a single course of conduct” with the same 
“ultimate purpose.” Id. at 419-21. 
“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the 
indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered 
at trial proves facts materially different from those 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page83 of 93

alleged in the indictment.” United States v. Banki, 685 
F.3d 99, 119 (2d Cir. 2012). Reversal due to a variance 
is appropriate only when the defendant can establish 
“that substantial prejudice occurred at trial as a result 
of the variance,” a showing that cannot be made 
“where the pleading and the proof substantially corre-
spond, where the variance is not of a character that 
could have misled the defendant at trial, and where 
the variance is not such as to deprive the accused of 
his right to be protected against another prosecution 
for the same offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294. So 
long as a defendant receives notice of the Govern-
ment’s theory, the defendant cannot show prejudice. 
See, e.g., Banki, 685 F.3d at 119. 
This Court reviews claims of constructive amend-
ment and prejudicial variance de novo. Dove, 884 F.3d 
at 146, 149. 
C. Discussion 
There is no likelihood—much less a substantial 
likelihood—that the jury convicted Maxwell solely be-
cause Jane was transported to New Mexico. At no 
point during the trial, including its summation, did the 
Government argue that the jury could convict on a the-
ory that Maxwell intended Jane to be abused in New 
Mexico. Similarly, the District Court’s charge required 
the jury to decide whether Maxwell intended to violate 
New York law. The trial contained no instructions de-
scribing for the jury any particular criminal statute in 
New Mexico, or any other basis by which a jury could 
convict based on conduct in New Mexico. 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page84 of 93

Maxwell’s argument to the contrary rests entirely 
on her reading of the jury note. According to Maxwell, 
the note shows that the jury “decided that there was 
no corroborating evidence that Maxwell was present 
for, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s trips to New 
York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Max-
well was present for Jane’s trip to New Mexico.” 
(Br.79). This reading, she claims, is buttressed by the 
fact that the jury acquitted on Count Two, which, in 
her telling, shows that the jury “determined that the 
only corroborating evidence linking Maxwell to the 
New Mexico trip was a flight log showing that she was 
present on the trip but said nothing about whether she 
‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take 
the trip.” (Br.79). 
Judge Nathan correctly rejected this argument. 
Judge Nathan found that the original jury instructions 
and the Government’s summation captured the core of 
criminality charged in the Indictment, focusing specif-
ically on conduct directed at and sexual activity in New 
York. (A.382-85). Even if the note revealed that the 
jury were confused and wondered whether it could con-
vict based on conduct in New Mexico, Judge Nathan’s 
response ameliorated that confusion. As Judge Nathan 
explained, she sent the jury back to the instruction, 
which “accurately instructed that Count Four had to 
be predicated on finding a violation of New York Law.” 
(A.387). That was sufficient. See United States v. 
Rommy, 506 F.3d 108, 126 (2d Cir. 2007) (court “enjoys 
considerable discretion” in “framing a response” to a 
jury note and “is only required to answer the particu-
lar inquiries posed”). As Judge Nathan explained, 
Maxwell failed to propose a better response, 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page85 of 93

requesting instead a series of instructions that were 
“unresponsive,” “redundant,” and “legally inaccurate.” 
(A.388-89). See Rommy, 506 F.3d at 126 (court re-
sponding to jury note “is not required to reference spe-
cific arguments advanced or defenses raised by counsel 
in urging particular outcomes”). Judge Nathan’s re-
sponse to the jury note was sound and did not con-
structively amend the Indictment. 
Maxwell’s contrary view rests on extensive specu-
lation about “which flights and evidence the jury was 
referencing in the note.” (A.386). The trial included, 
among other evidence, testimony by Jane about “tak-
ing numerous flights both on Epstein’s private plane 
and on commercial carriers.” (A.386). Maxwell ignores 
that evidence, focusing on a specific trip referenced in 
the flight logs. (Br.78-79). Even if Maxwell correctly 
identified the flight at issue, it still betrayed no jury 
confusion. The origin of that trip was New York, and 
the jury’s focus was on the “return flight”—which it 
could have inferred was a flight to New York, where 
Maxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity. 
Her view also rests on adopting one specific reading 
of a note that, as Judge Nathan explained, was “decid-
edly ambiguous as to the precise legal question being 
asked” (A.386). See Rommy, 506 F.3d at 126 (district 
court “enjoys considerable discretion in construing the 
scope of a jury inquiry”). Maxwell herself initially un-
derstood the note to be about “aiding and abetting” li-
ability, and whether sexual activity was a sufficiently 
“ ‘significant or motivating purpose’ for the travel.” 
(A.387); see United States v. Kim, 471 F. App’x 82, 84 
(2d Cir. 2012) (affirming jury instructions that 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page86 of 93

prostitution must be a “significant or motivating pur-
pose” of the interstate transportation). Maxwell only 
came to the theory she now advances after a lengthy 
discussion spanning ten pages of the transcript. 
(A.387). And that reading is far from clear: the jury’s 
question does not ask whether certain facts are suffi-
cient for guilt; it asks whether Maxwell “can be found 
guilty” if a certain fact is true. Maxwell “can” be found 
guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in 
New Mexico, which is probative of Maxwell’s intent 
and role in transporting Jane. That is a perfectly sen-
sible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was re-
peatedly raised by defense counsel to Judge Nathan at 
trial. (See, e.g., Tr.3149). 
Setting aside the jury note, Maxwell’s position re-
quires the jury to have reached a series of odd conclu-
sions. Jane testified at length about her travel to New 
York and the ensuing sexual abuse there. It would 
make little sense for the jury to reject that testimony, 
and then conclude that Maxwell arranged the uniden-
tified commercial return flight Maxwell now empha-
sizes, for which there is no documentary evidence in 
the record, including no specific corroboration of Max-
well’s role in arranging that flight. (Compare Br.79-80 
(“[T]he jury likely believed that if they found Maxwell 
had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from 
New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken 
place, they could convict her on the substantive trans-
portation count . . . .”) with Tr.3133 (defense argument 
that there is “no evidence” Maxwell arranged a return 
flight from New Mexico)). Maxwell suggests that the 
jury thought the flight records to be critical evidence, 
but the flight logs also demonstrate that Jane was 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page87 of 93

flown to New York on Epstein’s private jet, corroborat-
ing her testimony on that point. (See Br.79 (citing GX-
662-R at 44)). The same is true regarding Maxwell’s 
comparison of Counts Two and Four: in Maxwell’s 
view, the jury rejected nearly all of the evidence of 
Maxwell’s enticement of Jane to New York for lack of 
corroboration, and then convicted her based on an un-
supported speculative leap about arranging an uni-
dentified return flight from New Mexico. That is not 
plausible, and it certainly is not a “substantially 
likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscruta-
ble jury note. 
For similar reasons, no variance occurred. As dis-
cussed above, the proof at trial corresponded to the al-
legations in the Indictment, namely, evidence and ar-
gument that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to 
New York in order to facilitate sexual abuse there. 
Maxwell was also well aware that the Government’s 
proof would include conduct in New Mexico. (See 
A.117, 121-22, 126). Maxwell therefore had “fair and 
adequate notice” that the conspiracies included con-
duct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which is all that 
is required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 
622 (2d Cir. 2003). In any event, the Government pro-
duced on November 6, 2021—more than three weeks 
before trial—notes from an interview with Jane de-
scribing sexual abuse in New Mexico. That is suffi-
cient. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (rejecting a prejudice 
argument in part because “[t]he government disclosed 
the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page88 of 93

POINT V 
The Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable 
A. Applicable Law 
A district court commits procedural error if, among 
other things, it “makes a mistake in its Guidelines cal-
culation” or “fails adequately to explain its chosen sen-
tence.” United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d 
Cir. 2008) (en banc). This Court reviews a district 
court’s” application of the Guidelines de novo, while 
factual determinations underlying a district court’s 
Guidelines calculation are reviewed for clear error.” 
United States v. Cramer, 777 F.3d 597, 601 (2d Cir. 
2015). In explaining the sentence, a district court must 
show that “it has considered the parties’ arguments 
and that it has a reasoned basis for exercising its own 
legal decisionmaking authority.” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 
193. 
B. Discussion 
Maxwell argues that the District Court erred by ap-
plying a four-level leadership enhancement under 
§ 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. That enhance-
ment applies when a defendant was an “organizer or 
leader of a criminal activity that was . . . otherwise ex-
tensive,” which must include the defendant’s leader-
ship of at least one other criminal participant. 
U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 & cmt. n.2. Maxwell contests only 
whether the evidence showed that she led another 
criminal participant. (Br.84-85). 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page89 of 93

On that point, Judge Nathan found that Maxwell 
led Sarah Kellen. Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-
stein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s assistant. 
(A.417; see Tr.139-40, 1890). Judge Nathan found that 
testimony credible, in part because it was corroborated 
by other testimony that Maxwell was Epstein’s “num-
ber two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach 
where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen 
worked. (A.417). The trial evidence showed that Kellen 
scheduled sexualized massages and took nude photo-
graphs of Carolyn. (PSR ¶ 66; Tr.1554-55). Even after 
Kellen took over some of Maxwell’s duties, Maxwell 
continued to manage her by virtue of her position in 
the house, a fact corroborated by a household manual 
directing staff to tend to the specific needs of Epstein, 
Maxwell, and their guests, as well as flight records 
showing that Maxwell and Kellen flew together on Ep-
stein’s planes dozens of times. (A.417). The clear infer-
ence from this record is that Maxwell instructed Kel-
len regarding how to schedule massages and run the 
part of the scheme that Maxwell had previously han-
dled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls to 
schedule appointments following Maxwell’s directions. 
Maxwell argues that Judge Nathan erred because a 
defense witness testified that she, rather than Kellen, 
was Maxwell’s assistant. (Br.85). That uncorroborated 
testimony is not enough to render Judge Nathan’s 
finding clearly erroneous. Moreover, what matters is 
whether Maxwell exercised supervisory authority over 
Kellen, not whether Kellen or another individual was 
formally Maxwell’s assistant. 
Maxwell also argues that when imposing the 240-
month sentence, which was above the Guidelines 
Case 22-1426, Document 79, 06/29/2023, 3536060, Page90 of 93

range of 188 to 235 months’ imprisonment, Judge Na-
than “failed to provide reasons for its upward vari-
ance.” (Br.84). Maxwell’s one-sentence argument is so 
cursory and undeveloped that it should be deemed 
waived. See United States v. Botti, 711 F.3d 299, 313 
(2d Cir. 2013) (“It is a settled appellate rule that issues 
adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied 
by some effort at developed argumentation, are 
deemed waived.”). In any event, Judge Nathan en-
gaged in a lengthy discussion of the sentencing factors 
when imposing sentence, including Maxwell’s “pivotal 
role” in “heinous and predatory” sexual abuse of minor 
girls. (SA459). In describing the seriousness of the of-
fense, Judge Nathan found Maxwell’s crimes to be 
both “extensive” and far-reaching” and concluded that 
“the damage done to these young girls was incalcula-
ble,” as a result of “the painful, horrific, and lasting 
impact of [the] trauma” they endured. (SA460). After 
an extensive discussion of Maxwell’s horrifying crimes, 
Judge Nathan explained that this conduct “demands a 
substantial sentence that meets the scope of the con-
duct and the scope of the harm,” and that the sentence 
must “send an unmistakable message” of general de-
terrence to “those who engage in and facilitate the sex-
ual abuse and trafficking of underage victims” that 
“nobody is above the law.” (SA461). Accordingly, Judge 
Nathan concluded that “a very serious, a very signifi-
cant sentence is necessary to achieve the purposes of 
punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). (SA462). This 
discussion belies any claim that Judge Nathan inade-
quately explained the sentence.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT IN REPLY 
Ms. Maxwell relies on her arguments in her principal Appellant’s Brief, Points 
II and IV, and supplements her arguments in Points I, III, and V herein.  
Ms. Maxwell argues that she is a third-party beneficiary of the non-
prosecution agreement (hereinafter, “NPA”) and, as such, has standing to enforce 
the co-conspirator immunity provision which, by its terms, barred this prosecution. 
Alternatively, the District Court’s reliance on U.S. v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 
1985) to resolve perceived ambiguities was an error and the District Court should 
have ordered a hearing.  
Ms. Maxwell further argues that the District Court’s findings and conclusions 
concerning Juror 50 were an abuse of discretion in three respects: (1) Juror 50’s 
explanations for his false answers to a juror questionnaire were incredible on their 
face; (2) Juror 50’s concealed traumatic experience as a victim of childhood sexual 
abuse under circumstances analogous to the experiences of the Government 
witnesses, if known during voir dire, would have provided a valid basis for a 
challenge for cause; and (3) the Court abandoned its obligation to ascertain not 
merely the juror’s credibility, but also the validity of a challenge for cause, when it 
unduly narrowed the scope of its examination of Juror 50 at the post-trial hearing.  
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page7 of 35

Ms. Maxwell argues that the District Court’s sentence was in error because 
(1) its four-point enhancement under USSG Section 3B1.1 lacked any support in the 
record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal participant; and (2) its 
sentencing decision was predicated on a miscalculation of the applicable guideline 
range for incarceration and fines in the first instance and a subsequent failure to 
correct its error by either recalculating the sentence so as to comport with the proper 
guideline range or provide reasons for its upward departure. 18 U.S.C. Section 
3553(c)(2). 
The conviction must be reversed and the indictment dismissed or, in the 
alternative, the matter should be remanded for the appropriate hearings. 
POINT I 
(Point I in Appellant’s Principal Brief) 
MS. MAXWELL IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF A NON-
PROSECUTION AGREEMENT WHICH, BY ITS TERMS, BARRED THE 
USAO-SDNY FROM PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL FOR THESE 
OFFENSES. 
In this Circuit, while ordinarily any plea or non-prosecution agreement is 
confined to enforcement in the district of origin, under U.S. v. Annabi, supra., there 
is an exception wherein "it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a 
broader restriction," as is the case here. See Annabi at 672. This exception dictates 
that the NPA be enforced to protect Ms. Maxwell as a third-party beneficiary to the 
agreement from prosecution for these offenses. See U.S. v. Cambindo-Valencia, 609 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page8 of 35

F.2d 603 (2nd Cir. 1979) (standing for the proposition that there can be a third-party 
beneficiary of a plea bargain of another). The NPA, together with the Justice Office 
of Professional Responsibility (hereinafter, “OPR”), establish that the immunity 
given Ms. Maxwell precluded the United States from prosecuting her in the Southern 
District of New York or elsewhere. 
A. Ms. Maxwell has Standing to Enforce the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
as a Third-Party Beneficiary. 
The District Court correctly found that Ms. Maxwell is a third-party 
beneficiary of the NPA, and, for that reason, has standing to enforce it.1  As the 
Seventh Circuit has observed, plea agreements, like all “ordinary contracts,” may be 
enforced by third parties “when the original parties intended the contract to directly 
benefit them as third parties.”  U.S. v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 663 (7th Cir. 2000) 
(indicating that third-party beneficiary standing applies to “[i]mmunity agreements” 
and “plea bargains,” but concluding on the facts presented, that defendants were not 
third-party beneficiaries).  No circuit has held otherwise, and this Court should not 
create a split on this issue.  The Seventh Circuit has been joined by numerous district 
courts in holding that an agreement promising immunity to a third party may be 
enforced by that party if that party is later prosecuted in breach of the agreement.  
In its brief, the Government fails to concede that the Court found that Maxwell was 
in fact a third-party beneficiary of the NPA.

See U.S. v. Stolt-Nielsen, 524 F.Supp.2d 609, 613-14, 620-23, 628 (E.D. Pa. 2007) 
(dismissing indictment against Stolt-Nielsen’s “directors and/or officers,” as they 
were “intended third-party beneficiaries of the [Conditional Leniency] Agreement” 
between the DOJ Antitrust Division and Stolt-Nielsen); U.S. v. Florida West Int’l 
Airways, Inc., 853 F.Supp.2d 1209, 1228-32 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (dismissing indictment 
against employee of air cargo provider, as he had “third party beneficiary standing 
necessary to establish [his] immunity under the Plea Agreement” between the 
Government and his employer); U.S. v. El-Sadig, 133 F.Supp.2d 600 (N.D. Ohio 
2001) (“[E]ven if the non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated 
to Defendant El-Sadig, he can enforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party 
beneficiary”); U.S. v. CFW Const. Co., Imc., 583 F.Supp. 197 (D.S.C. 1984) (“[A]n 
intended third party beneficiary of a contract may enforce its provisions….Thus, if 
the Government, in negotiating the aforementioned plea agreements, ‘promised’ that 
there would be no prosecution against CFW…the promise must be enforced.”).   
This rule makes sense. “Plea agreements are interpreted in accordance with 
contract law principles,” U.S. v. Colon, 220 F.3d 48, 51 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing U.S. 
v. Altrom 180 F.3d 372, 275 (2d Cir. 1999)), and it is hornbook contract law that an 
intended third-party beneficiary may enforce a contract. See Subaru Distribs. Corp. 
v. Subaru of Am., Inc., 425 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2005); Bochese v. Town of Ponce 
Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 982 (11th Cir. 2005).  There is no reason to treat plea or non-
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page10 of 35

prosecution agreements differently from other contracts.  If anything, Second Circuit 
precedent strongly suggests that courts may depart from ordinary contract principles 
when construing plea agreements only when such departures cut against the 
Government.  See U.S. v. Riggi, 649 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2011) (“[B]ecause plea 
agreements are unique contracts, we temper the application of ordinary contract 
principles with special due process concerns for fairness and the adequacy of 
procedural safeguards”) (quoting U.S. v. Woltmann, 610 F.3d 37, 39-40 (2d Cir. 
2010)); In re Altro, 180 F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[P]lea agreements are unique 
contracts…[W]e hold the Government ‘to the most meticulous standards of both 
promise and performance.’”) (original ellipses omitted) (quoting U.S. v. Lawlor, 168 
F.3d 633, 636 (2d Cir. 1999)).  It would turn this doctrine on its head to deviate from 
ordinary contract principles in a manner that benefits the Government.    
To the extent the Government argues that Ms. Maxwell is not a third-party 
beneficiary because the NPA did not mention her by name (Br. 18)2, that argument 
should be rejected.  As this Court has held, “an intention to benefit a third party may 
be gleaned from the contract as a whole and the party need not be named specifically 
as a beneficiary.”  Owens, 601 F.2d at 1250 (citing Newin Corp. v. Hartford Accident 
“Br.” refers to the Government’s brief; “A” refers to the appendix filed with Ms. 
Maxwell’s brief; “SA” refers to the supplemental appendix filed with the 
Government’s brief; and “Dkt” refers to an entry on the District Court’s Docket for 
this case. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page11 of 35

& Indemn. Co., 37 N.Y.2d 211, 219 (N.Y. 1975).  And, as the court stated in Florida 
West, a plea agreement is enforceable by a third party as long as the “[a]greement 
evince[s] an intent to extend [immunity] to a definable class of third parties'' and the 
third party seeking enforcement “fall[s] within this category of beneficiaries.”  853 
F.Supp.2d at 1228-29; see id. at 1214 (defendant, as a third-party beneficiary, could 
enforce a plea agreement between the Government and an air cargo company, which 
immunized unnamed “employees” of the company’s subsidiaries); see also Stolt-
Nielsen, 524 F.Supp.2d at 613, 620 (defendants, as third-party beneficiaries, could 
enforce an agreement between the Government and Stolt-Nielsen, which promised 
leniency to unnamed directors, officers, and employees).   
Here, the NPA grants immunity to “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, 
including but not limited to [four named individuals].”  A178. As the District Court 
recognized, this is a definable class that includes Ms. Maxwell.  A1443 (“[T]he co-
conspirator provision…cover[s] any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed 
by Epstein from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and 
To the extent that the Government suggests that Ms. Maxwell is not a co-
conspirator within the meaning of the NPA, the trial evidence demonstrated, 
according to the Government’s main brief, that she was a member of the conspiracies 
charged in the indictment from 1994- 2004 in the SDNY and elsewhere. Moreover, 
there was significant overlap between the investigation in Florida and the trial. 
Specifically, investigators in Florida had interviewed Carolyn (SA86, SA72fn.72; 
SA193fn.241), Virginia Roberts (SA173fn.217, SA193fn.240, fn.241), and Annie 
Farmer (SA193fn.239). 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page12 of 35

U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related 
grand jury investigation.”); cf. Florida West, 853 F.Supp.2d at 1228-29. 
B. The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
Binds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.  
Embedded within Annabi’s canon of construction that prosecutors in one 
district cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must 
be a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention.  Thus, if "it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction," 
Annabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 
1986). 
The language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which 
(1) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any 
criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (A178), (2) 
contains a structural separation of this clause from the more restrictive language used 
elsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global” 
agreement.  Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators 
easily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language. No 
such language was utilized and was, in fact, removed from the co-conspirator clause.  
 A promise to bind other districts can be inferred from negotiations between a 
defendant and a prosecutor. See United States v. Alessi, 554 F2d 1139,1153-4 (2d 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page13 of 35

Cir 1976).  The OPR4 (SA1-348) contains just such evidence of the negotiations 
between the Government and Epstein’s counsel which, in corroborating an intent on 
the part of the parties to draft a co-conspirator clause that provided broader 
immunity, accords with the plain meaning of the NPA. This is so, notwithstanding 
that the OPR relies almost exclusively on the distant recollection of government 
employees whose judgment and professionalism were being questioned with little to 
no input from Epstein’s attorneys as to who or what they intended or understood the 
co-conspirator clause of the NPA to cover. See SA166. 
The Government questions why Epstein would have sought a broader grant 
of immunity for co-conspirators than for himself. Br.21. But the answer is provided 
in the OPR. The line prosecutor remembered that defense counsel told her that 
“Epstein wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what 
happened.” SA193. Indeed, the Government believed that Epstein’s conduct was his 
own “dirty little secret” and did not have any specific evidence against Ms. Maxwell 
even though they had interviewed Carolyn, the complainant in Count Six, and Annie 
Farmer, two of the four women who testified at trial (SA193), and had also 
The Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility investigated and 
issued a report on the NPA (SA1-348) on issues tangential to the instant appeal, but 
it provides a skeletal outline of the United States’ negotiation with a multitude of 
Epstein’s counsel. In particular, the investigation was focused on “whether any of 
the [Government actors were] influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper 
motive…to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein.” SA166. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page14 of 35

interviewed Virginia Roberts, who the Government elected not to call as a witness. 
And, of course, a broader immunity deal for co-conspirators accomplished what 
Epstein may not have been able to obtain more directly, namely co-conspirator 
immunity that would have insulated Epstein from criminal prosecutions elsewhere, 
where co-conspirators might otherwise have been forced to testify against him in 
return for leniency.  
There is no question that the NPA did not contain standard federal plea 
agreement language. SA103 fn.120. The co-conspirator clause was, in the words of 
the Government, “unusual,” even “very unusual” and “pretty weird.” SA194, SA212 
fn.258. Not surprisingly, the first iteration of this clause was proposed by the 
defense.  SA95. It “preclude[d] the initiation of any and all criminal charges which 
might otherwise in the future be brought against [four named female assistants] or 
any employee of [a specific Epstein corporate entity] for any criminal charge that 
arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”5 Id. This demonstrates that, from the 
beginning, the defense sought immunity for third parties beyond the SDFL. The 
Government responded with a draft proposal that resolved the federal criminal 
liability of any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any 
criminal conduct by those persons known to the USAO as of the date of the 
Notably, even in this iteration, Ms. Maxwell would have been protected as she was 
Epstein’s employee. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page15 of 35

agreement. SA100, SA105 fn.122. However, that language, limiting co-conspirator 
immunity to the Southern District of Florida, was removed from the final signed 
NPA.  SA166-167fn.237, fn.239, & fn.240. The intentional excision of this limiting 
language from the draft version of the co-conspirator clause establishes that that 
limitation was not intended to apply to the co-conspirator clause.  Indeed, it is 
difficult to imagine any clearer evidence than the purposeful removal of that limiting 
language, especially as it is replaced by the term “United States.” And to punctuate 
this point, the U.S. Attorney himself as part of a final review and edit of the NPA, 
instructed the line prosecutor to restore the reference to Epstein’s desire to reach a 
global agreement of his State and Federal criminal liabilities. SA110. 
The Government denies that Main Justice was involved in the plea 
negotiations. Br. 22. But the OPR demonstrates that Andrew C. Lourie, Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General for the Department’s Criminal Division and Chief of 
Staff to Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, was actively participating in a 
critical phase of plea negotiations in September “from his new post at the 
Department in Washington, DC.” SA101. After his transfer, he continued to be 
consulted on the negotiations and apprised of their status. He repeatedly rendered 
opinions, trying to close the deal involving a plea agreement and the NPA (SA106, 
110). On September 24, 2007, Lourie, now stationed in Washington D.C. at Main 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page16 of 35

Justice, sent additional comments on the NPA ‘s final draft. SA110. That afternoon, 
the final version was circulated and signed.   
C. The Court’s Failure to Hold a Hearing on the Scope of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement is an Error.  
What is significant with regard to this issue is the lack of a sufficient record. 
Given that the District Court ignored the plain language of the co-conspirator clause 
together with the corroborating evidence from the OPR that establishes that that 
language was changed to remove rather than add words of limitation, the District 
Court’s decision to apply Annabi’s rule of construction without a hearing was an 
error.  This is especially so because the OPR was lacking in relevant information 
from defense counsel as to their understanding of the agreement and, in the absence 
of such information, the District Court was obligated to resolve any ambiguities in 
favor of Ms. Maxwell.  
The Government argues that, based upon Annabi, there is no need for a 
hearing. But, in fact, courts in this Circuit have routinely recognized the need for 
evidentiary hearings where the scope of an agreement is in dispute. The failure to 
hold a hearing precluded Ms. Maxwell from offering evidence as to the intent and 
understanding of defense counsel; as a result, the Court did not construe the NPA 
against the Government, as the law requires, but against Ms. Maxwell. See United 
States v. Difeaux, 163 F.3d 725, 728 (2d Cir. 1998). A reviewing court must read the 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page17 of 35

NPA’s ambiguous provisions against the Government, which drafted the agreement 
and enjoys unequal bargaining power in the sentencing process. See United States v. 
Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558-
(2d Cir. 1996); See also Difeaux at 728. In this instance, the District Court 
accepted the facts proffered by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District 
of New York and relied on Annabi to preclude any further inquiry, thereby 
eviscerating the exception in U.S. v Russo, supra.  
Epstein performed under the NPA in response to the promise of the United 
States. The Government, having received the totality of the benefit of the bargained 
elements in the NPA, should be held to its terms. There is no remedy other than 
enforcement of the NPA according to its terms or, should the Court determine that 
such terms are ambiguous, the holding of a hearing. Should the hearing establish that 
Epstein understood the co-conspirator clause to be global, while the Government 
deemed its reach a mistake or the subject of regret, Epstein, now dead, cannot undo 
it. The Government, having removed limiting language in the NPA, cannot restrict 
the NPA in retrospect, as it had convinced the District Court.

POINT II 
(Point IV in Appellant’s Principal Brief) 
THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN CREDITING A JUROR’S 
PATENTLY DISHONEST TESTIMONY OFFERED TO EXPLAIN FALSE 
ANSWERS TO MATERIAL QUESTIONS IN VOIR DIRE AND FURTHER 
ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT HONEST ANSWERS TO THOSE SAME 
QUESTIONS WOULD HAVE NOT PROVIDED A VALID BASIS TO 
REMOVE THE JUROR FOR CAUSE. 
Juror honesty is the bedrock of the criminal jury system. McDonough Power 
Equipment v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984). Voir dire examination serves to 
protect the right to a trial by an impartial jury. It is designed to expose biases both 
known and unknown. The trial judge has broad flexibility in responding to 
allegations of juror misconduct, particularly when the incidents relate to statements 
made by the jurors themselves, rather than to outside influences, and do not violate 
the sanctity of jury deliberations. See FRE 606(b)(1). 
"A juror's dishonesty during voir dire undermines a defendant's right to a fair 
trial." United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 468 (S.D.N. Y. 2012) (citing 
Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 11(1933), vacated on other grounds sub nom. 
United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2015). 
A. Juror 50 Concealed Material Information in Voir Dire by Giving False 
Answers on a Juror Questionnaire and Then Lied About it to the Court 
in a Post-Verdict Hearing.  
Juror 50 was given a questionnaire to execute under oath. It contained a 
statement of the case, calling attention to the subject of sex trafficking of minors on 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page19 of 35

the fourth page of the document. It posed its questions in the form of “Have you or 
[anyone else]?” The juror gave the Court and counsel sworn false answers on his 
questionnaire relating to the most sensitive issues in the case. U.S. v Langford, 990 
F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1993).  
The court held a hearing narrowly confined to an inquiry about the juror’s 
false answers on the questionnaire. A326. The juror, through counsel, invoked his 
Fifth Amendment privilege and was granted immunity by the Government to the 
extent he testified truthfully. Ironically, he testified that his false statements on the 
jury questionnaire were inadvertent. Hence, there was no reasonable basis upon 
which to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege as he was not admitting to having 
made intentionally false statements, and his exposure to a perjury charge existed 
without an immunity deal.  This immunity deal was a Potemkin village, providing 
only the veneer of credibility. The court repeatedly noted that the immunity deal 
provided Juror 50 “a strong incentive to testify truthfully” (A333, A336, A340), 
when in fact it provided only a strong incentive to offer testimony that would satisfy 
the Government’s interest in preserving the verdict. 
There can be no dispute that Juror 50’s testimony established conclusively 
that he falsely answered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire – 
Questions 25, 48 and 49. A299, A310, A311. It is no coincidence that Juror 50 gave 
false answers to these questions and only these questions. These were the questions 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page20 of 35

that, had he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Juror 
testified that he inadvertently answered incorrectly all, and only, the questions 
that would have elicited information about his child sexual abuse.6 In response to the 
Court’s inquiry as to whether he could have been fair and impartial, he replied by 
rote in the affirmative. His answers and explanations were incredible, ever shifting, 
and even outright contradictory. He attributed his false answers to having simply 
misread questions because he was tired and distracted, but then claimed that one 
answer was predicated on his view that a stepbrother was not a family member, and 
another, on his view that he did not consider that his sexual assault made him a 
victim of a crime (A268) – an explanation that made sense only if he had actually 
read and understood the questions in the first instance.  
Juror 50’s testimony was incredible as a matter of law, but the Court found 
that the juror’s false statements were an “inadvertent mistake.” A340, 347. The 
Court refused to inquire as to the juror’s post-trial activity that included multiple 
media interviews about the part his own experience as a victim of sexual abuse 
played in his role as a juror on this case. Nor would the Court inquire about Juror 
50’s statements concerning a second juror’s undisclosed sexual abuse. Dkt. 613 at 
None of the 18 individuals selected for service as a deliberating or alternate juror 
answered “yes” when asked if they were a victim of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or 
sexual harassment. DKT. 613. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page21 of 35

p28. Juror 50’s pretrial selective false answers only to questions that would have 
elicited his child sexual abuse, his post-verdict activity, and his patently false and 
contradictory explanations in the post-verdict hearing should have disqualified him 
for service as a juror in this case. 
B. Had Juror 50 Disclosed in Voir Dire his Traumatic Experience as a 
Victim of Child Sex Abuse, the Information Would Have Established a 
Valid Basis for a Cause Challenge 
At the hearing, Juror 50 disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which 
significantly paralleled the abuse described by the Government’s four key victim 
witnesses at trial. Like the four accusers, Juror 50 (i) was sexually abused as a minor; 
(ii) was abused on multiple occasions over the course of several years; and (iii) 
delayed reporting the abuse. A267-268. Like the four accusers, Juror 50 was abused 
by two people who were friends and who each had participated in the abuse. A267. 
Furthermore, Juror 50 was not abused by a stranger or sexually assaulted by someone 
he did not know. Like the four accusers, he was sexually abused by someone familiar 
to him, namely his stepbrother. These similarities are significant and contrast sharply 
with other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for cause, 
but who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented 
at trial. In this situation, where Juror 50 experienced the same traumatic childhood 
sexual abuse that the trial victims had experienced, with many of the same 
surrounding circumstances, he was not capable of setting his experiences aside and 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page22 of 35

impartially deciding the case solely on the evidence at trial. See Daugerdas, 867 F. 
Supp. 2d at 472 (“Courts imply bias ‘when there are similarities between the 
personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” (quoting United 
States v. Sampson, 820 F. Supp. 2d 151, 163-64 (D. Mass. 2011)); Sampson v. U.S. 
724 F.3d 150, 167 (1st Cir 2013) (“It would be natural for a juror who had been the 
victim of [the same crime] to harbor bias against a defendant accused of such a 
crime.”). Had this information come to light during voir dire, Juror 50 would have 
been struck for cause. Sampson, 724 F.3d at 167 (affirming grant of new trial when 
juror in a gunpoint bank robbery case did not disclose that she had been threatened 
by her husband with a gun); State v. Ashfar, 196 A.3d 93, 94-97 (N.H. 2018) 
(affirming grant of new trial when juror in child sexual assault case did not disclose 
that he was sexually assaulted by a babysitter when he was five or six years old); 
U.S. v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 47-48 (2d Cir. 1997) (affirming for cause strike of juror 
in a structuring case who did not disclose she had engaged in similar structuring 
activity herself); Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d 1150 1159 (10th Cir. 1991) (affirming 
grant of new trial when juror in murder case involving domestic violence did not 
disclose she was living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial). 
Inexplicably, the Court held that, based on the answers of the juror at the 
hearing, he would not have been excused for cause, even if he had disclosed his 
childhood abuse during voir dire.  The Court’s determination that it would not have 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page23 of 35

granted a challenge for cause of the juror had he given truthful answers, is an abuse 
of discretion. Demonstrated bias in the responses to questions in voir dire may result 
in a juror being excused for cause. The necessity of truthful answers by prospective 
jurors is obvious, if this process is to serve its purpose. The failure to provide truthful 
answers is itself a proper challenge for cause.  
After the hearing, the court held that the juror was entitled to use his “life 
experiences” in deliberations, even though the life experiences mirrored testimony 
at trial and were particular to the charges against Maxwell. But "[w]hen a juror has 
life experiences that correspond with evidence presented during trial, that 
congruence raises obvious concerns about the juror's possible [implied or inferred] 
bias." U.S. v. Torres, 128 F.3d at 47-48; see Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d 1150, 1158-
(10th Cir. 1991). That bias went unexplored at the hearing resulting in the failure 
of the Court to take proper steps to screen the juror for bias after the verdict. 
A conviction will only be reversed if the District Court abused its discretion 
by incorporating an error of law, or resting its decision on a clearly erroneous factual 
finding.  Here, both the Court’s finding that Juror 50 was credible (a clearly 
erroneous factual finding), and its ruling that Juror 50’s truthful answers during voir 
dire would not have established a valid basis for cause (an error of law), meet that 
standard for abuse of discretion. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page24 of 35

C. The District Court Abused Its Discretion in Imposing Unreasonable 
Limitations on the Range of Questions it Agreed to Pose to Juror 50 at 
the Post-Verdict Hearing. 
The Court’s decision to narrow the scope of the hearing to questions relating 
only to the juror’s false responses to the juror questionnaire, was an abuse of 
discretion because it deprived Ms. Maxwell of a full and fair opportunity to establish 
Juror 50’s bias. For example, the court refused to ask Juror 50 why he disclosed to 
the jury that he was a victim of sexual assault. According to Juror 50, coming to a 
unanimous verdict “wasn’t easy, to be honest.” In fact, several jurors doubted the 
credibility of Jane and Carolyn. “When I shared that [I had been sexually abused],” 
recounted Juror 50, the jurors who had doubts “were able to sort of come around on, 
they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse.” Dkt 613 
at 14. 
The standard of review applies to questions that the court decides to ask or to 
not ask a juror.  This Court recently emphasized that a court’s discretion is not 
boundless in this regard. See U.S. v Nieves, 58 F.4th 623, 626 (2d Cir. 2023). The 
discretion must be exercised consistent with 'the essential demands of fairness.'" 
United States v. Barnes, 604 F.2d 121, 137-38 (2d Cir. 1979) (footnote omitted), 
quoting Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308, 310 (1931); see also United States 
v. Bright, 2022 WL 53621, at *1 (2d Cir. Jan. 6, 2022) (summary order).  
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page25 of 35

"[T]he defense deserves 'a full and fair opportunity to expose bias or prejudice 
on the part of veniremen.'" United States v. Colombo, 869 F2d 149, 151 (2d Cir. 
1989) quoting Barnes 604 F2d at 139. Nieves at 632. Nieves stands for the 
proposition that there must be sufficient fact finding to allow for facts probative of 
the three forms of bias to reveal themselves. Otherwise, a violation of fundamental 
fairness arises if the voir dire is not adequate to identify unqualified jurors. Here, the 
inquiry by the Court at the post-verdict hearing failed to provide a full and fair 
opportunity to expose bias. While it need not give the defense lawyers the 
opportunity to question the juror, it must fulfill its constitutional duty to eliciting 
sufficient information to allow a determination of whether a challenge to the juror 
for cause should be made.  
U.S. v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, (2d Cir. 2002) set out the types of bias that 
produce proper cause challenges. Cause challenges are generally based on one of 
three species of bias: (1) actual bias, or "bias in fact"; (2) implied bias, or bias that 
is "presumed as a matter of law" where a typical person in the juror's position would 
be biased, irrespective of whether actual bias exists; and (3) inferable bias, which 
arises "when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently 
significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, 
but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias."  285 F.3d at 171-172. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page26 of 35

All three forms of bias must be "grounded in facts developed at voir dire." Torres, 
128 F.3d at 47.  
The bias implied by the juror’s false answers went unexplored. Nieves turned 
on the court’s failure to explore juror bias related to gangs – a prejudice analogous 
to the systematic or pervasive bias in the community against accused sex traffickers 
and those who consort with them. Maxwell, tied to Epstein by media coverage, went 
to trial against a constant drumbeat of news and allegations concerning child 
molesters and sex trafficking. Far more pervasive than fear of gang violence was 
fear and revulsion as to child sex abuse and trafficking of which Epstein, and then 
Maxwell became the poster child. In the hearing, and despite defense suggested 
questions, the Court refused to explore Juror 50’s child sexual abuse for bias.  
To assess a challenge for cause as to this seated juror after trial the court 
should use the same standards for cause challenges at trial. To do otherwise would 
appear to shield the verdict rather than the defendant from improper juror bias. As 
in Nieves, the juror’s omitted information related to a “material issue” that was at 
trial “the cornerstone of the government’s theory.” There was a strong likelihood 
that the material issue would skew deliberations considering the strong feelings that 
sex trafficking of minors engenders. See Nieves; see also Barnes, 604 F.2d at 137-
139. The court deprived Maxwell unfairly of the opportunity post-trial to unearth a 
pervasive bias relevant to the issue pivotal to the case against her. 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page27 of 35

D. Juror 50’s Actual, Implied, and Inferable Bias Was Established. 
Maxwell does not seek a per se rule of exclusion of victims of child abuse in 
sex trafficking cases, although admittedly, it would be difficult to imagine how such 
a traumatic experience could fail to give rise to inferable bias. Certain life 
experiences create permanent biases. Nevertheless, it is this juror in this situation 
that the law would properly “cautiously incapacitate” because persons in such a 
situation would naturally feel prejudice. In his post-verdict interviews, Juror 50 
admitted as much when he described how he identified with the Government 
witnesses through the lens of his own experience of child sexual abuse; convinced 
other jurors to credit the testimony of Government witnesses and discredit defense 
witnesses precisely because of his unique insight about memory for child sexual 
assault; and bonded so profoundly with the Government witnesses that he felt 
compelled to contact one after trial and to give interviews about his own experience. 
Suffice to say, this was not an example of an impartial juror using his “life 
experiences” in the performance of his civic duty, contrary to the Court’s view. 
A352. 
Juror 50 had no such relationships to the parties, counsel, or the very crime 
itself. But his omissions during voir dire presented the sort of "extreme situation" 
that would qualify for presumptive bias. Torres at 46. The average person, 
victimized by sexual abuse, would be biased when he speaks about his healing 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page28 of 35

process, his trauma and his need for therapy to “deal with the stress of the [Maxwell] 
case. A353-354.   
In determining whether a juror should be excluded on the grounds of implied 
bias, a juror’s statements in voir dire are completely irrelevant. The juror may 
declare that he feels no prejudice in the case. But the law cautiously incapacitates 
him from serving on the jury because, in general, persons in a similar situation would 
feel prejudice. U.S. v Burr, 25 Fed Cas. 49,50 (C.C. Va. 1807). It is called the 
average person test. See U.S. v Haynes, 398 F2d 980, 984 (2d Cir 1968); Dennis v 
U.S. 339 U.S. 162,176 (1950). Juror 50 fails that test.  
Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 222 (1982) (O'Connor, J., concurring)), led 
this Court to caution that “automatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who 
are related to the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.” Id. (quoting 
Torres, 128 F.3d at 45). But this limited set of examples is not exclusive. And while 
sex abuse victims who timely disclose their victimization may not be presumed 
biased, jurors who do not disclose their victimization, thereby depriving the court 
and counsel of vital information as to challenges for cause or peremptory challenges 
create the extreme situation warned about by Justice O’Connor and the Torres court. 
See also Nieves.  
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page29 of 35

This Court has also recognized a third form of partiality, known as inferable 
bias, applicable in "a few circumstances that involve no showing of actual bias, and 
that fall outside of the implied bias category, where a Court may, nevertheless, 
properly decide to excuse a juror." Torres, 128 F.3d at 46-47, Daugerdas, 867 F. 
Supp. 2d at 475. 
Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of 
partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to 
excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make a presumption of bias 
mandatory. Torres at 43, 47. In Torres, the Second Circuit declined to "consider the 
precise scope of a trial judge's discretion to infer bias." Id. The circumstances herein 
present a scenario in which bias is inferred from the non-disclosure of critical 
potentially disqualifying information at the time of voir dire because the risk of 
partiality is sufficiently significant to excuse a juror for cause based on non-
disclosure. "Because [in such cases] the bias of a juror will rarely be admitted by the 
juror himself, partly because the juror may have an interest in concealing his own 
bias or partly because the juror may be unaware of it, [partiality] necessarily must 
be inferred from surrounding facts and circumstances.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 
558 (Brennan, J., concurring). 
Juror 50 claims not to have connected his history with the charges in the case 
despite the description in the questionnaire. The implausibility of the explanation 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page30 of 35

that he did not see that key questions related to sex abuse and his belief that they 
only applied to others and not to him beggars belief since the process was to 
determine if he was to be a qualified juror. The court, in accepting his answers, was 
credulous, willing to trust the juror’s answers almost uncritically.  
The Court also ignored existing authority for the proposition that a new trial 
may still be ordered, separate from the McDonough prongs if the defendant can show 
bias. See, e.g., Jones v. Cooper, 311 F.3d 306, 310 (4th Cir. 2002) A showing that a 
juror was actually biased, regardless of whether the juror was truthful or deceitful, 
can also entitle a defendant to a new trial."); Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., 164 F.3d 
511, 516 (10th Cir. 1998) ("The advent of the [McDonough] test did not eliminate a 
litigant's broader historic right to prove actual or implied juror bias."). In 
McDonough itself, Justices Blackmun, Stevens, and O'Connor concurred separately 
"to clarify that juror partiality could still be proven by showing actual or implied 
bias." McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556.  
While the McDonough Court highlighted the importance of the voir dire 
process as a guard against juror bias, it also noted that no trial is perfect, and that 
counsel has a responsibility to obtain relevant information from prospective jurors. 
464 U.S. at 554-55. While the court unfairly limited the inquiry into Juror 50’s bias, 
the record, nevertheless, amply demonstrates that Juror 50 gave intentionally false 
statements under oath in his juror questionnaire to conceal that he had experienced 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page31 of 35

childhood sexual abuse identical to that experienced by the victims in the case and 
lied to conceal his misconduct at the hearing. The Court abused its discretion in not 
granting Ms. Maxwell a new trial.  
POINT III 
(Point V in Appellant’s Principal Brief) 
THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN SENTENCING MS. MAXWELL 
The Government defends the Court’s decision to apply a four-level leadership 
enhancement under Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. However, the trial 
evidence did not support a finding that Ms. Maxwell was an “organizer or leader of 
a criminal activity that was…otherwise extensive,” because there was no evidence 
that she supervised another criminal participant. Specifically, the court’s finding that 
Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal 
participant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This 
error coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as 
required by 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(c)(2), requires that Ms. Maxwell be resentenced.  
To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been 
the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. See 
USSG Section 3B1.1, cmt. n.2. The Government at sentencing correctly conceded 
that there was no direct evidence that Maxwell supervised Kellen. A406.  The two 
pilots did not know who Kellen worked for and waffled in their testimony. Tr. 204, 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page32 of 35

1892. But Kimberly Espinoza did. Id. In fact, according to Espinoza, by the time 
Kellen began working for Epstein in 2001-2002, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein “went 
their separate ways” (Tr. 2370) and Kellen sat in the office where Ms. Maxwell used 
to sit and managed Epstein’s properties. Tr. 2337, 2370-71, 2375-6, 2382. Carolyn 
corroborates this fact when she testified that there was a clean break in time between 
when she dealt with Maxwell and when she dealt with Kellen. Tr. 1527. There is, 
quite simply, not a single witness that testified that Ms. Maxwell supervised Kellen 
in any capacity, much less in connection with anything of a criminal nature. Nor 
does the existence of an earlier version of the 2005 household manual, attested to by 
Juan Alessi (Tr. 808) or flight records support a finding that Ms. Maxwell supervised 
Sarah Kellen as a criminal participant. This is the thin gruel upon which the court 
based its finding (see A417) and it is simply not sufficient to support the 
enhancement even by a preponderance of the evidence. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated here and in Points I and II of Ms. Maxwell’s Principal 
Brief, the Convictions should be reversed, and the Indictment, or a portion thereof, 
be dismissed and a new trial ordered on any remaining counts. Alternatively, for the 
reasons stated in Point I, the matter should be remanded to the District Court for a 
hearing. For the reasons stated in Points III (Point II herein) and IV of Ms. Maxwell’s 
Principal Brief, the Convictions should be reversed, and the matter remanded for a 
Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page33 of 35

new trial. Alternatively, for the reasons stated in Point III of Ms. Maxwell’s Principal 
Brief (Point II herein), the matter should be remanded to the District Court for a 
hearing. For the reasons stated in Point V of Ms. Maxwell’s Principal Brief (Point 
III herein), the matter should be remanded to the District Court for resentencing.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Docket No. 22-1426 
Argument date: March 12, 2023 
Dear Ms. Wolfe: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter, pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 28(j), to inform this Court of United States v. Watkins, 940 F.3d 
152 (2d Cir. 2019).   
In Watkins, this Court explained that the portion of the Bail Reform Act, 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E), that required a detention hearing for “any felony . . . that in-
volves a minor victim . . . .” permits a court to conduct a “conduct-specific inquiry in 
which the judicial officer may look beyond the elements of the charged offense to con-
sider the actual conduct underlying the arrestee’s charged offense.”  940 F.3d at 165, 
167.  Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,’” it “suggest[s] factual details 
surrounding the charged conduct.”  Id. at 166.  The Court also noted the absence of a 
textual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.”  Id. at 166 
n.70.  The Court further explained that its conclusion was reinforced by legislative 
history, namely, the inclusion of Section 3142(f)(1)(E) in a statute intended to “afford 
minor victims of crime the greatest degree of protection.”  Id. at 166. 
The Court contrasted Section 3142(f)(1)(E) with another portion of the Act that 
contains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because 
that text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime,’ an ‘offense,’ and a ‘felony,’” indicating an em-
phasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id. (quoting 18 
U.S.C. § 3182(f)(1) (discussing “a case that involves . . . a crime of violence . . .”); see 
id. at 162-65.

The same principles apply to the statute of limitations at issue here. (See Gov. 
Br. 42-49).  That statute covers an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse . . . 
of a child,” 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (2003), which similarly “suggests factual details sur-
rounding the charged conduct” and lacks language like “has as an element.”  And it 
is also part of a statute intended to afford broader protections for minor victims of 
crimes.  See, e.g., Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2017).

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). She was principally sentenced to 
concurrent terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 
months, respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of 
supervised release. 
On appeal, the questions presented are whether (1) Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida barred Maxwell’s 
prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York; (2) a second superseding indictment of March 
29, 2021, complied with the statute of limitations; (3) the District Court 
abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new 
trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a 
fair and impartial jury; (4) the District Court’s response to a jury note 
resulted in a constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, 
the allegations in the second superseding indictment; and (5) 
Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this 
complex case, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, judgment 
of conviction.

JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). The District Court imposed concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 months, 
respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of supervised release 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page3 of 26

of three years, three years, and five years, respectively. The District 
Court also imposed a fine of $250,000 on each count for a total of 
$750,000. 
On appeal, the questions presented are (1) whether Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) 
barred Maxwell’s prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office 
for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”); (2) whether 
Maxwell’s second superseding indictment of March 29, 2021 (the 
“Indictment”) complied with the statute of limitations; (3) whether the 
District Court abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 
motion for a new trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth 
Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District 
Court’s response to a jury note resulted in a constructive amendment 
of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the Indictment; and 
(5) whether Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable. 
We hold that Epstein’s NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY as the NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY.  We hold 
that Maxwell’s Indictment complied with the statute of limitations as 
U.S.C. § 3283 extended the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for 
offenses committed before the date of the statute’s enactment. We 
further hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on one juror’s 
erroneous answers during voir dire. We also hold that the District 
Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a constructive 
amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page4 of 26

Indictment. Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is procedurally 
reasonable. 
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction. 
I.  BACKGROUND 1 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage 
girls. Starting in 1994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to 
engage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with 
these young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual 
topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2004, this pattern of sexual abuse 
continued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in 
various locations in the United States. 
1. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement  
In September 2007, following state and federal investigations 
into allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered 
into an NPA with USAO-SDFL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida 
Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial 
and described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678 
F.3d 208, 210-11 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction 
entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the 
light most favorable to the Government.”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page5 of 26

Statutes § 796.07,2 and to one count of solicitation of minors to engage 
in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.03.3  He agreed to 
receive a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment on the two 
charges. In consideration of Epstein’s agreement, the NPA states that 
“the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but 
not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia 
Marcinkova.”4 
2. Maxwell’s Indictment and Trial-Related Proceedings 
The Indictment filed against Maxwell contained eight counts, 
six of which proceeded to trial.5 Prior to the commencement of trial, 
Florida Statutes § 796.07 provides in relevant part:  
(2) It is unlawful:  
(f) To solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution, 
lewdness, or assignation. 
Florida Statutes § 796.03, which has since been repealed, provided in relevant part: “A 
person who procures for prostitution, or causes to be prostituted, any person who is under 
the age of 18 years commits a felony of the second degree.” 
A-178. 
Count One charged Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged Maxwell with enticement of a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charged Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charged Maxwell with 
transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking conspiracy, in 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page6 of 26

prospective jurors completed a lengthy questionnaire, with several 
questions raising issues relevant to the trial. Based on the completed 
questionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to proceed to in-
person voir dire. The District Court ultimately empaneled a jury. 
During the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the Government 
presented evidence of the repeated sexual abuse of six girls. At the 
conclusion of trial, on December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell 
guilty on all but one count.6  
Following the verdict, Juror 50 gave press interviews during 
which he stated that he was a survivor of child sexual abuse.7 In his 
answers to the written jury questionnaire, however, Juror 50 answered 
“no” to three questions asking whether he or a friend or family 
member had ever been the victim of a crime; whether he or a friend or 
family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family member 
had ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking of a minor, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. Counts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell 
with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The perjury charges were severed from the 
remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing. 
The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. Maxwell was 
acquitted on Count Two. 
Consistent with a juror anonymity order entered for trial, the parties and the District Court 
referred to the jurors by pseudonym. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page7 of 26

assault.8 Upon learning of the interviews, the Government filed a letter 
on January 5, 2022, requesting a hearing; Maxwell then moved for a 
new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. On March 8, 
2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified—under 
grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to 
sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the 
answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not 
affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50’s testimony 
to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a new 
trial in a written order.   
Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment to be followed by five years’ supervised release, and the 
Question 2 asked “[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim 
of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the 
victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or 
attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, 
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked  
[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, 
sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of 
law or informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual 
assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, 
supervisor, teacher, or family member. 
See A-299, A-310. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page8 of 26

District Court imposed a $750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory special 
assessment. This appeal followed. 
II.  DISCUSSION 
1. The NPA Between Epstein and USAO-SDFL Did Not Bar 
Maxwell’s Prosecution by USAO-SDNY 
Maxwell sought dismissal of the charges in the Indictment on the 
grounds that the NPA made between Epstein and USAO-SDFL 
immunized her from prosecution on all counts as a third-party 
beneficiary of the NPA. The District Court denied the motion, rejecting 
Maxwell’s arguments. We agree. We review de novo the denial of a 
motion to dismiss an indictment.9  
In arguing that the NPA barred her prosecution by USAO-SDNY, 
Maxwell cites the portion of the NPA in which “the United States [ ] 
agree[d] that it w[ould] not institute any criminal charges against any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”10 We hold that the NPA with 
USAO-SDFL does not bind USAO-SDNY. 
It is well established in our Circuit that “[a] plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which 
the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement 
See, e.g., United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22 (2d Cir. 2018).  
A-178. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page9 of 26

contemplates a broader restriction.”11 And while Maxwell contends 
that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed 
outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.12 Applying 
Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows 
that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where 
the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the 
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein 
fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district: 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 
and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been 
the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any 
United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circuits have 
been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 
1986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 550 (3d Cir. 2002). 
See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order) 
(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States 
v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered 
into in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only 
where subsequent charges are “suﬃciently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier 
agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that 
rested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause 
applied, the subsequent charges were “suﬃciently distinct” and therefore fell outside the 
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This Court did not, however, conclude that the 
rule of construction it announced depended on the similarities between earlier and 
subsequent charges. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page10 of 26

offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation 
will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein 
if any, will be dismissed.13  
The only language in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope is 
limiting language.  
The negotiation history of the NPA, just as the text, fails to show 
that the agreement was intended to bind other districts. Under our 
Court’s precedent, the negotiation history of an NPA can support an 
inference that an NPA “affirmatively” binds other districts.14 Yet, the 
actions of USAO-SDFL do not indicate that the NPA was intended to 
bind other districts.  
The United States Attorney’s Manual that was operable during 
the negotiations of the NPA required that:  
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any 
agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind any other 
district(s) or division without the express written approval of 
A-175 (emphasis added). The agreement’s scope is also limited in an additional section:  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these oﬀenses shall be 
deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein 
abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth 
below.  
Id. (emphasis added). 
See United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).   
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page11 of 26

the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.15 
Nothing before us indicates that USAO-SDNY had been notified or 
had approved of Epstein’s NPA with USAO-SDFL and intended to be 
bound by it. And the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division stated in an interview with the Office of Professional 
Responsibility that she “played no role” in the NPA, either by 
reviewing or approving the agreement. 
The history of the Office of the United States Attorney is instructive 
as to the scope of their actions and duties. The Judiciary Act of 1789 
created the Office of the United States Attorney, along with the office 
of the Attorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided 
for the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to 
act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn 
or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall 
be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, 
cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil 
actions in which the United States shall be concerned.”16 The Judiciary 
Act thus emphasized that U.S. Attorneys would enforce the law of the 
United States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S. 
Attorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact, 
the phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of 
United States Attorney’s Manual § 9-27.641 (2007).  
An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 20, § 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 
(1789) (emphasis added). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page12 of 26

the actions and the duties of the U.S. Attorneys would be limited to 
their own districts, absent any express exceptions. 
Since 1789, while the number of federal districts has grown 
significantly, the duties of a U.S. Attorney and their scope remain 
largely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Attorneys, “within [their] district, 
shall (1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States; (2) 
prosecute or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or 
proceedings in which the United States is concerned.”17 Again, the 
scope of the duties of a U.S. Attorney is cabined to their specific district 
unless otherwise directed.18 
In short, Annabi controls the result here.  Nothing in the text of 
the NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded 
USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the 
28 U.S.C. § 547.  
This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Attorney’s powers do not 
extend beyond their districts. For instance, under 28 U.S.C. § 515 a U.S. Attorney can 
represent the Government or participate in proceedings in other districts, but only when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General:  
The Attorney General or any other oﬃcer of the Department of Justice, or any 
attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General under law, may, when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding 
. . . which United States attorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not 
he is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page13 of 26

Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s 
motion without an evidentiary hearing. 
2. The Indictment Is Timely 
Maxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment 
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and 
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided 
by § 3283.19 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot 
apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of 
limitations to those offenses that were committed before the enactment 
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that 
the District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the 
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to 
dismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.20 
First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly 
applied Weingarten v. United States.21 In Weingarten, we explained that 
Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific 
18 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution for an oﬀense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child 
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for 
ten years after the oﬀense, whichever is longer.”  
United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2018).  
865 F.3d 48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 313-
(S.D.N.Y. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page14 of 26

approach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”22 We see no reason 
to depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question 
presented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual 
abuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the 
case. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that 
she had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a 
minor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283 
applies to those oﬀenses.  
Second, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the 
Indictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the 
extended statute of limitations provided by the 2003 amendment to 
§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding 
whether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether 
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.”23 If 
Congress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the 
The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to 
look “only to the statutory deﬁnitions of the prior oﬀenses, and not to the particular facts 
underlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United 
States, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of 
the conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach. 
See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-60. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] . . . reaches beyond the 
oﬀense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the oﬀense.” Id. at 59-60. Second, 
legislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 60. 
Third, a case-speciﬁc approach would not produce practical diﬃculties or potential

statute as it is written.”24 If the statute “is ambiguous or contains no 
express command regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must 
determine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would 
create presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.”25 
Here, the inquiry is straightforward.  In 2003, Congress 
amended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would 
otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall 
preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”26 The text of 
§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it 
prevent the application of any statute of limitations that would 
otherwise apply to past conduct.   
The statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend 
the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as 
the prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to 
conclude that the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 applies to 
Maxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.

3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying 
Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial 
Maxwell contends that she was deprived of her constitutional right 
to a fair and impartial jury because Juror 50 failed to accurately 
respond to several questions related to his history of sexual abuse as 
part of the jury questionnaire during jury selection. Following a special 
evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a 
new trial.  
We review a District Court’s denial of a motion for a new trial for 
abuse of discretion.27 We have been extremely reluctant to “haul jurors 
in after they have reached a verdict in order to probe for potential 
instances of bias, misconduct or extraneous influences.”28 While courts 
can “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice 
so requires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), they should do so “sparingly” and 
only in “the most extraordinary circumstances.”29 A district court “has 
See Rivas v. Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d Cir. 1996). “[W]e are mindful that a judge has 
not abused her discretion simply because she has made a diﬀerent decision than we would 
have made in the ﬁrst instance.” United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2001). 
We have repeatedly explained that the term of art “abuse of discretion” includes errors of 
law, a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or “a decision that cannot be located 
within the range of permissible decisions.” In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

broad discretion to decide Rule 33 motions based upon its evaluation 
of the proof produced” and is shown deference on appeal.30  
A Rule 33 motion based on a juror’s alleged erroneous response 
during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood.31 Under McDonough, a party seeking a new trial “must first 
demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question 
on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have 
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”32 
The District Court applied the McDonough standard, found Juror 
50’s testimony credible, and determined that Juror 50’s erroneous 
responses during voir dire were “not deliberately incorrect” and that 
“he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate 
responses to the questionnaire.”33 In fact, as the District Court noted, 
Maxwell did not challenge the inclusion of other jurors who disclosed 
past experience with sexual abuse, assault, or harassment. This is 
United States v. Gambino, 59 F.3d 353, 364 (2d Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
464 U.S. 548 (1984).  
Id. at 556. 
A-340 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court reminds us that “[t]o invalidate the result 
of a [ ] trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist 
on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.”

Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page18 of 26

enough; the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s motion for a new trial.34   
4. The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result 
in a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance 
from, the Allegations in the Indictment 
During jury deliberations, the jury sent the following jury note 
regarding Count Four of the Indictment: 
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the 
transportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to 
New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in 
sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second 
element?35 
The District Court determined that it would not respond to the note 
directly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and 
instead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.36 
Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 50 rather than allowing the parties to 
do so. In conducting a hearing on potential juror misconduct, “[w]e leave it to the district 
court’s discretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning 
the witnesses, and whether to hold the hearing in camera.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 
540, 544 (2d Cir. 1989). And while Maxwell contends that the District Court improperly 
limited questioning about Juror 50’s role in deliberations, she both waived that argument 
below and fails to show here how any such questioning would not be foreclosed by Federal 
Rule of Evidence 606(b).   
A-238.  
A-207-221. The District Court’s instruction on the second element of Count Four required 
the jury to ﬁnd that “Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page19 of 26

Maxwell subsequently filed a letter seeking reconsideration of the 
District Court’s response, claiming that this response resulted in a 
constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. The District Court 
declined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion. 
Maxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the 
alleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that 
testimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the 
jury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the 
charges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this 
testimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.  We 
disagree and affirm the District Court’s denial.  
We review the denial of a motion claiming constructive 
amendment or prejudicial variance de novo.37 To satisfy the Fifth 
Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the 
elements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the 
charge against which he must defend.”38 We have explained that to 
prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must 
demonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by 
the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify 
essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial 
intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a 
criminal oﬀense in violation of New York law.” A-205. 
See United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146, 149 (2d Cir. 2018). 
United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page20 of 26

likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense 
other than that charged in the indictment.”39 A constructive 
amendment requires reversal.40 
We cannot conclude that a constructive amendment resulted 
from the evidence presented by the Government—namely, Jane’s 
testimony—or that it can be implied from the jury note. We have 
permitted significant flexibility in proof as long as a defendant was 
“given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”41 In turn, 
“[t]he core of criminality of an offense involves the essence of a crime, 
in general terms; the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime 
falls outside that purview.”42 
We agree with the District Court that the jury instructions, the 
evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s summation 
captured the core of criminality. As the District Court noted, while the 
jury note was ambiguous in one sense, it was clear that it referred to 
the second element of Count Four of the Indictment. Therefore, the 
District Court correctly directed the jury to that instruction, which 
“accurately instructed that Count Four had to be predicated on finding 
United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. 1988).  
See United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 417 (2d Cir. 2012).  
United States v. Ionia Mgmt. S.A., 555 F.3d 303, 310 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (emphasis 
omitted).

Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page21 of 26

a violation of New York law.”43 It is therefore not “uncertain whether 
[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand 
jury’s indictment.”44 
We also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially 
varied from the Indictment. To allege a variance, a defendant “must 
establish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the 
evidence alleged in the indictment.”45 To prevail and win reversal, the 
defendant must further show “that substantial prejudice occurred at 
trial as a result” of the variance.46 “A defendant cannot demonstrate 
that he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the 
proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character 
that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the 
variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be 
protected against another prosecution for the same offense.”47 
For reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the 
constructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts 
A-387; see United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The trial judge is in the 
best position to sense whether the jury is able to proceed properly with its deliberations, 
and [ ] has considerable discretion in determining how to respond to communications 
indicating that the jury is experiencing confusion.”)

“materially different” from the allegations in the Indictment.48 The 
evidence indicated that Maxwell transported Jane to New York for 
sexual abuse and conspired to do the same. Maxwell knew that the 
evidence also included conduct in New Mexico.49 Furthermore, 
Maxwell cannot demonstrate “substantial prejudice.” Maxwell 
received—over three weeks before trial—notes of Jane’s interview 
recording the abuse she suffered in New Mexico. This is enough to 
conclude that Maxwell was not “unfairly and substantially” 
prejudiced.50 
5. Maxwell’s Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable 
Lastly, Maxwell argues that her sentence was procedurally 
unreasonable because the District Court erred in applying a leadership 
sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines and 
inadequately explained its above-Guidelines sentence.51  We disagree.   
Dove, 884 F.3d at 149.  
As the District Court found, “[t]he Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls in New York. In service of this scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein 
and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at various properties and in various 
states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.” A-393. 
See United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that a defendant was 
not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed the 
evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). 
At sentencing, the District Court calculated a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ 
imprisonment and sentenced Maxwell to a slightly above-Guidelines term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page23 of 26

We review a sentence for both procedural and substantive 
reasonableness, which “amounts to review for abuse of discretion.”52  
We have explained that procedural error is found when a district court 
“fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines 
range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider 
the [Section] 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly 
erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.”53 
The District Court did none of that. It is important to emphasize that 
the Sentencing Guidelines “are guidelines—that is, they are truly 
advisory.”54 A District Court is “generally free to impose sentences 
outside the recommended range” based on its own “informed and 
individualized judgment.”55 
With respect to the four-level leadership enhancement, the District 
Court found that Maxwell “supervised” Sarah Kellen in part because 
of testimony from two of Epstein’s pilots who testified that Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant. The District Court found that testimony credible, 
in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell 
was Epstein’s “number two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach, 
United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 187 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). “Regardless of whether 
the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must 
review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 
38, 51 (2007).  
United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 38 (2d Cir. 2012). 
Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189. 
Id.  
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page24 of 26

where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked.56 We 
therefore hold that the District Court did not err in applying the 
leadership enhancement. 
With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court 
properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the 
sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell’s “pivotal role in 
facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of 
deceptive tactics.”57 The District Court recognized that the sentence 
“must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell’s conduct, of Ms. Maxwell’s 
offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the 
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.”58 And the District Court 
explained that “a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary 
to achieve the purposes of punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In 
sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its 
sentence.  
CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we hold as follows: 
A-417. 
SA-459. 
SA-461. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page25 of 26

1.  The District Court did not err in holding that Epstein’s NPA 
with USAO-SDFL did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution by USAO-
SDNY. 
2. The District Court did not err in holding that the Indictment 
was filed within the statute of limitations.  
3. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. 
4. The District Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a 
constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the 
allegations in the Indictment.  
5. The District Court’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 
29, 2022, judgment of conviction.

INTRODUCTION AND RULE 35(B)(1) STATEMENT 
En Banc may be ordered when, as here, the panel decision was based on a 
decision of this Court that it was not permitted to overrule.1 That decision, United 
States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam), created a canon of 
construction for interpreting plea agreements that conflicts with the authoritative 
decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue 
and stands in tension with what the Supreme Court and this Circuit have written 
about plea and immunity agreements.  
Annabi holds that “a plea agreement binds only the office of the United 
States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively 
appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Annabi at 672. This 
default rule necessarily conflicts with the long-standing rule in this circuit (and 
others) that plea agreements are to be construed “strictly against the 
Government.” United States v. Padilla, 186 F.3d 136, 140 (2d Cir. 1999) 
(quoting United States v. Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558-59 (2d Cir. 1996). United States 
v. Johnson, 93 F.4th 605, 616-617 (2024).  See also United States v. Difeaux, 163 
F.3d 725, 728 (2d Cir. 1998) (“The reviewing court must … construe ambiguous 
A panel is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by 
an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court See United States v. Wilkerson, 361 F.3d 
717, 732 (2d Cir. 2004). 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page6 of 51

provisions against the government, which drafted the agreement and enjoys 
unequal bargaining power in the sentencing process.”).  
The Court should overrule Annabi because it is an outlier and incompatible 
with “fairness in securing agreement between an accused and a prosecutor.” See 
Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261 (1971). Alternatively, the Court should 
limit Annabi as follows: Annabi should not apply (1) to plea agreements from other 
circuits that do not have such a rule; (2) to offenses based on the same conduct that 
was the subject of a non-prosecution or plea agreement;  (3) where there are 
“affirmative indications” that the defendant reasonably understood the agreement 
to bind other districts;  and (4) without discovery and an evidentiary hearing. Here, 
Annabi was applied to a plea that was negotiated and executed in the Eleventh 
Circuit (a circuit that does not follow Annabi); to an offense based on the same 
conduct that the “United States” had agreed not to prosecute; despite affirmative 
appearances of intent to bind other districts; and without discovery and a hearing.

ISSUE PRESENTED 
Whether the canon of construction adopted by the Second Circuit in Annabi, 
whereby perceived ambiguities in the scope of immunity in a plea agreement are 
resolved in favor of the government, should be overruled or limited. 
BACKGROUND 
In September 2007, following state and federal investigations of alleged 
unlawful sexual activity, Jeffrey Epstein entered into a non-prosecution and plea 
agreement (“NPA”) with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”). A173-179.2 In return for pleading guilty to 
state charges, receiving an eighteen-month sentence and consenting to jurisdiction 
and liability for civil suits under 18 U.S.C. Section 2255, irrespective of where 
those claims arose, the government agreed, inter alia, not to prosecute Epstein in 
the SDFL for the offenses from 2001-2007 then under investigation. In addition, 
“the United States also agree[d] that it will not institute any criminal charges 
against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [four 
named individuals].” A178. The co-conspirator clause was negotiated at the same 
time that the terms of Epstein’s liability for civil claims without geographic 
Numerical references preceded by “A” and “SA” are to the appendices filed with Appellant’s 
Brief and the Government’s Brief, respectively.  
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page8 of 51

limitation were negotiated. SA78. Relying on the NPA, Epstein pled guilty in state 
court on June 30, 2008, and fulfilled all his promises. SA137.  
In July of 2019, Epstein was indicted in the SDNY on charges of sex 
trafficking and conspiracy related to conduct in Florida and New York between 
2003 and 2005. He died by suicide on August 10, 2019. One year later, Maxwell 
was indicted. Initially, Maxwell was charged with crimes in the 1994 to 1997 
timeframe, in an apparent effort to circumvent the time frame covered by the NPA. 
However, on March 29, 2021, the SDNY added in its superseding indictment, a sex 
trafficking offense (Count Six) related to conduct and offenses wholly within the 
timeframe and subject matter covered by the NPA and contained in the proposed 
indictment in SDFL that was resolved by the NPA. A114. Doc 293 at p10 as 
referenced in A45.  
Maxwell moved to dismiss the indictment based on the clear language of the 
NPA. Alternatively, in the event that the court determined that the language of the 
NPA was ambiguous, Maxwell, who was not a party to the agreement, sought 
discovery and a hearing to establish affirmative evidence of intent to bind other 
districts consistent with the plain language in the co-conspirator clause. Her motion 
was denied without a hearing or discovery. 3  A145. The District Court found that 
While the District Court did not order discovery, it did order the government to disclose to 
Maxwell “any evidence supporting a defense under the NPA.” A145. The government responded 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page9 of 51

while Maxwell was a beneficiary of the NPA and had standing to enforce its terms, 
the NPA did not grant immunity to Maxwell in the SDNY. The District Court based 
its decision on Annabi. The case proceeded to trial and the jury found Maxwell 
guilty on, inter alia, Count Six.  
In 2019 the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility 
investigated whether and to what extent prosecutors in the SDFL improperly 
resolved the federal investigation of Epstein in 2007-2008 by the very NPA at issue 
here. Their investigation overlapped the prosecutions of Epstein and Maxwell in 
the SDNY and did not involve interviewing any defense counsel. The OPR did not 
contain a finding as to whether the co-conspirator clause of the NPA bound other 
districts, although it stated that “witnesses” stated that the clause provided 
transactional immunity and “found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Attorney from 
declining to prosecute third parties or providing transactional immunity.” SA165.  
PANEL DECISION 
On appeal, Maxwell argued, inter alia, that the NPA barred her prosecution in the 
SDNY by its express language. That language read  
In consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide 
compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully 
fulfills all the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States 
also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any 
that its review “did not include search terms relevant to the NPA, and the Government has not 
searched [the SDFL prosecutor’s] inbox for communications relating to the NPA.” 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page10 of 51

potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [four 
named individuals]. 
A178. 
A unanimous panel of this Court applied the holding in Annabi, 771 F.2d. at 672, 
to the co-conspirator clause in the NPA to permit the prosecution of Maxwell, a 
beneficiary of that agreement, in the SDNY, notwithstanding that clause contained 
no limiting language. U.S. v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d. Cir. 2024).  The Court, 
quoting Annabi held, that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United 
States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively 
appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Id at 263.  The Court 
applied Annabi even though the NPA had been negotiated in the Eleventh Circuit 
where no such contrarian rule of construction exists and did so without benefit to 
Maxwell of discovery or an evidentiary hearing. The Court found that neither the 
plea agreement nor the “negotiation history” showed that the co-conspirator clause 
was “meant to” bind other districts. Yet the clause contained no limiting language 
and “several witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not 
to prosecute unidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional 
immunity” (SA165). Notably, Maxwell was denied both discovery and a hearing and 
was therefore left to rely on the NPA and the OPR which was based on documents 
that were not shared with Maxwell and an investigation that did not include 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page11 of 51

interviewing Epstein’s lawyers. Notably, the prosecutors could not recall why the 
clause had been added, much less who it was meant to immunize. SA104-106. 
The Court also relied on the United States Attorneys’ Manual’s directive that 
districts not bind other districts without the express written approval of the United 
States Attorneys in the affected districts and the Judiciary Act of 1789 to suggest that 
US Attorneys are “cabined to their specific district unless otherwise directed.” 118 
F.4th at 265. Notably, the Manual also contains an admonition that USAOs who do 
not wish to bind USAOs in other districts explicitly limit the scope of an NPA to 
their districts. Justice Manual 9-27-630.  This admonition implicitly acknowledges 
that AUSAs can bind other districts and that it is the obligation of the government to 
make explicit any limitation in the scope of immunity.  
ARGUMENT 
EN BANC REVIEW IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER 
ANNABI’S CANON OF CONSTRUCTION FOR PLEA AGREEMENTS 
SHOULD BE OVERRULED OR LIMITED 
The Panel based its decision on Annabi. Annabi should be overruled because 
its canon of construction for interpreting plea agreements conflicts with the 
authoritative decisions of other circuits that have addressed the issue and stands in 
tension with what the Supreme Court and this Circuit have written about plea and 
immunity agreements. 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page12 of 51

In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment in the 
EDNY with conspiring to import, importing, and possessing heroin with intent to 
distribute.  See 771 F.2d at 671.  After they pled guilty to the substantive importation 
charge (Count Two), the prosecutor represented to the court that “the only agreement 
that exists between defendants and the Government is that at the time of the 
imposition of sentence on Count Two, the Government would move to dismiss the 
two open remaining counts…” Id.  Accordingly, the conspiracy and possession 
counts were dismissed.  See id.  Subsequently, the defendants were indicted in the 
SDNY with conspiracy to distribute heroin.  See id.  Whereas the dismissed EDNY 
charges had only alleged a conspiracy on or about a date in 1982, the new SDNY 
charges alleged criminal conduct extending from 1982 to 1985.  The defendants 
argued that these new charges were barred by their plea agreement with the USAO-
EDNY.  See id.  The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing—obtaining 
testimony from both the prosecutor and the defense attorney from the EDNY 
proceedings—and concluded that the agreement was not meant to bind the USAO-
SDNY.  See id.  The Second Circuit noted that this result was highly counterintuitive, 
acknowledging that “[a] plea agreement whereby a federal prosecutor agrees that 
‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment…might be thought to bar the 
United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district….”  
Id. at 672.  Nevertheless, the Court declared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,” 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page13 of 51

adding, “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for 
the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”  Id.  The Court concluded that, 
because the conspiracy alleged in the SDNY indictment “extended for an additional 
two years” beyond the date of the conspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, “the 
new charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule 
concerning construction of plea agreements.”  Id.  
Annabi has been sharply criticized.  One circuit said it was “unable to discern 
a sound basis for the [Annabi] rule,” adding that the decision “really has no 
analytically sound foundation.”  U.S. v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 547 (3d Cir. 2002).  
Annabi cited three prior cases from this Circuit in support of the rule.  771 F.2d at 
672 (citing U.S. v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d 1065 (2d Cir. 1985); U.S. v. Alessi, 544 F.2d 
1139 (2d Cir. 1976); and U.S. v. Papa, 533 F.2d 815 (2d Cir. 1976)).  But, as Gebbie 
explained, Annabi misread this Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule 
out of whole cloth:  
The first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely 
relies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa …  
The court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. … 
Papa, however, provides no support for the rule the Second Circuit 
follows. … Although Papa held that the plea agreement did not bind 
other districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind only one 
district, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly interpreted this case 
as meaning that plea agreements do not bind other districts absent an 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page14 of 51

affirmative appearance of doing so. Papa does not explain or attempt 
to rationalize the rule that has evolved. 
294 F.3d at 547-48 (brackets and italics in original; bold added). 
Annabi stands in tension with what the United States Supreme Court has 
written about plea and immunity agreements.  In Santobello, 404 U.S. 257 (1971)—
the seminal case on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s 
promise in a plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might 
have been unaware of the promise.  As Santobello explained, “[t]he staff lawyers in 
a prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘letting the left hand know what the right 
hand is doing’ or has done.”  404 U.S. at 262.  And in Giglio v. United States, the 
Supreme Court held that an AUSA had a duty under Brady to disclose a promise of 
immunity that another AUSA had made to a testifying witness, even though the first 
AUSA had been falsely assured that no such promise was made.  See 405 U.S. 150, 
154 (1972) (“The prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for 
the Government.  A promise made by one attorney must be attributed, for these 
purposes, to the Government”) (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 272).  
These premises are inconsistent with the notion that a federal prosecutor in one 
district has no obligation to honor promises made by his or her counterpart in 
another. 
Appellant is not aware of any published authority from another circuit that 
follows Annabi in holding that an ambiguous promise made in a plea agreement by 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page15 of 51

one USAO is presumed not to bind other USAOs.4  To the contrary, the weight of 
authority holds that a representation by the United States Attorney or her agents will 
bind USAOs in other districts, if not the federal Government as a whole.  See Gebbie, 
294 F.3d at 550 (“[W]hen a United States Attorney negotiates and contracts on behalf 
of ‘the United States’ or ‘the Government’ in a plea agreement … that attorney 
speaks for and binds all of his or her fellow United States Attorneys with respect to 
those same crimes and those same defendants.  … United States Attorneys should 
not be viewed as sovereigns of autonomous fiefdoms.”); U.S. v. Van Thournout, 100 
F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir. 1996) (“Absent an express limitation, any promises made by 
an [AUSA] in one district will bind an [AUSA] in another district”); Margalli-
Olvera v. I.N.S., 43 F.3d 345, 353 (8th Cir. 1994) (“promises made by an [AUSA]” 
in a plea agreement “bind all agents of the United States government”); Thomas v. 
I.N.S., 35 F.3d 1332 (9th Cir. 1994) (enforcing against the INS a cooperation 
agreement between defendant and an AUSA promising that “the government” would 
not oppose defendant’s application for relief from deportation); U.S. v. Levasseur, 
846 F.2d 786, 799 (1st Cir. 1988) (expressly declining to apply Annabi in the 
estoppel context, instead holding that “the representation of any [AUSA] may, in 
The Seventh Circuit held in U.S. v. Rourke that a plea agreement did not bind the Federal Aviation Administration.  
See 74 F.3d 802, 807 n.5 (7th Cir. 1996).  But Rourke did not go as far as Annabi in ruling that a promise by one 
USAO is presumptively nonbinding on other USAOs.  The Sixth Circuit in U.S. v. Robinson held, on the facts before 
it, that a plea agreement in the Eastern District of North Carolina was not binding in the Eastern District of Michigan, 
but explicitly declined to take a position on Annabi’s broader rule.  See 924 F.2d 612, 613 (6th Cir. 1991).

appropriate circumstances, be invoked to estop the United States…”); U.S. v. 
Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 1986) (“Whenever a United States Attorney 
negotiates and enters a plea agreement, it is the Government that ‘agrees’ to whatever 
is agreed to.”); U.S. v. Carter, 454 F.2d 426 (4th Cir. 1972) (en banc) (vacating 
conviction where a plea “bargain was allegedly breached in a neighboring district,” 
adding that “[t]he United States government is the United States government 
throughout all of the states and districts”); Young v. U.S., 953 F.Supp.2d 1049, 1069 
n.4 (D.S.D. 2013) (plea agreement between defendant and “the United States” in 
West Virginia would bind federal prosecutors in South Dakota); Little v. U.S., Nos. 
1:08-cr-59, 1:09-cv-822, 2010 WL 3942749, at *3 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 7, 2010) (plea 
agreement between defendant “and the United States of America,” which was “silent 
as to the effect it may have with respect to other United States Attorneys,” would be 
interpreted to “bind[] the United States Attorneys in all other districts”). 
Annabi is also out of step with the law of this Circuit.  It is well-settled that 
“we determine whether a plea agreement has been breached by looking to the 
reasonable understanding of the parties and by resolving any ambiguities against the 
Government.”  In re Altro, 180 F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir. 1999); see also U.S. v. 
Carmichael, 216 F.3d 224 (2d Cir. 2000) (“[W]e ‘construe plea agreements strictly 
against the Government.’”) (quoting U.S. v. Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 559 (2d Cir. 1996)).  
But Annabi flips this formulation on its head, holding that an ambiguous promise of 
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page17 of 51

immunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding 
just one USAO rather than the Government as a whole, “unless it affirmatively 
appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”  771 F.2d at 672.  
Annabi did not explain or acknowledge its departure from this longstanding doctrine. 
This Court has been exceedingly reluctant, until now, to affirm a conviction 
on the force of Annabi’s reasoning.  Previous decisions from this Court that cited 
Annabi have done so essentially in dictum (as in cases involving unambiguous plea 
agreements, which do not require resort to Annabi’s canon of construction),5 or for 
points unrelated to whether an agreement with one USAO will bind another,6 or—
in one case—in an unpublished decision that provided too little information to clarify 
whether the plea agreement as a whole was ambiguous.7

doctrinally flawed, expanding it into “new…context[s]” would be “a disfavored 
judicial activity”) (quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857, 1859 (2017)).  
At minimum, Annabi’s questionable doctrine should limited in four respects: 
First, Annabi should not apply to pleas that originate outside the Second 
Circuit. Unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in the Eleventh 
Circuit.  Under textbook choice-of-law rules and principles of fairness, it would be 
unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution canon of construction, derived from 
the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto a plea agreement negotiated with 
prosecutors in a circuit where the very opposite rule applies, i.e. that ambiguities in 
plea agreements are to be resolved against the government.  Under Eleventh Circuit 
precedent, even if the reference to “the United States” were deemed ambiguous, the 
ambiguity “must be read against the government.’”  U.S. v. Jefferies, 908 F.2d 1520, 
1523 (11th Cir. 1990) (citing In re Arnett, 804 F.2d 1200, 1203 (11th Cir. 1986)); see 
also Rowe v. Griffin, 676 F.2d 524, 526 n.4 (11th Cir. 1982).  And this result would 
bring the Eleventh Circuit in line with every circuit that has directly confronted this 
question (other than the Second Circuit).  See Gebbie, 294 F.3d at 550; Van 
Thournout, 100 F.3d at 594; Harvey, 791 F.2d at 303. 
Second, Annabi should only apply when “the new charges are sufficiently 
distinct” from the old ones.  771 F.2d at 672.  And Annabi made clear that charges 
are “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.  
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page19 of 51

Id.  Here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct from 
2001 through 2004 that falls entirely within the 2001-2007 offense period 
contemplated by the NPA.   
Third, Annabi should apply only if there are no “affirmative” indications 
whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind other USAOs.  See Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 671; Alessi, 544 F.2d at 1154; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823-25.  That is not the 
case here. Appellant produced ample evidence that the NPA was intended to bind 
other USAOs.  See Appellant’s Principal Brief at 33-38. The investigation itself 
suggests it was meant to bind the SDNY, in particular, because the investigation was 
active in the SDNY at the time the NPA was negotiated. SA72, 84, 86, 127. See Doc 293 
at 16. Defense counsel understood the plea agreement to provide “genuine finality.” 
SA118. This reasonable understanding, supported by the NPA itself and the limited 
negotiation history contained in the one-sided OPR was sufficient to preclude 
application of Annabi.  
Fourth, at most, Annabi should apply, if at all, only after the court permits 
discovery and conducts an evidentiary hearing.  See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 671; Papa, 
533 F.2d at 823.  Here, appellant was denied discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page20 of 51

CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Appellant respectfully requests that this Petition be 
granted and that this Court vacate the Panel decision, overrule Annabi and dismiss 
the indictment or remand for an evidentiary hearing.

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). She was principally sentenced to 
concurrent terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 
months, respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of 
supervised release. 
On appeal, the questions presented are whether (1) Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida barred Maxwell’s 
prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York; (2) a second superseding indictment of March 
29, 2021, complied with the statute of limitations; (3) the District Court 
abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new 
trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a 
fair and impartial jury; (4) the District Court’s response to a jury note 
resulted in a constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, 
the allegations in the second superseding indictment; and (5) 
Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this 
complex case, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, judgment 
of conviction.

JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). The District Court imposed concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 months, 
respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of supervised release 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page3 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page26 of 51

of three years, three years, and five years, respectively. The District 
Court also imposed a fine of $250,000 on each count for a total of 
$750,000. 
On appeal, the questions presented are (1) whether Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) 
barred Maxwell’s prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office 
for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”); (2) whether 
Maxwell’s second superseding indictment of March 29, 2021 (the 
“Indictment”) complied with the statute of limitations; (3) whether the 
District Court abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 
motion for a new trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth 
Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District 
Court’s response to a jury note resulted in a constructive amendment 
of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the Indictment; and 
(5) whether Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable. 
We hold that Epstein’s NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY as the NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY.  We hold 
that Maxwell’s Indictment complied with the statute of limitations as 
U.S.C. § 3283 extended the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for 
offenses committed before the date of the statute’s enactment. We 
further hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on one juror’s 
erroneous answers during voir dire. We also hold that the District 
Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a constructive 
amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page4 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page27 of 51

Indictment. Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is procedurally 
reasonable. 
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction. 
I.  BACKGROUND 1 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage 
girls. Starting in 1994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to 
engage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with 
these young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual 
topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2004, this pattern of sexual abuse 
continued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in 
various locations in the United States. 
1. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement  
In September 2007, following state and federal investigations 
into allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered 
into an NPA with USAO-SDFL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida 
Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial 
and described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678 
F.3d 208, 210-11 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction 
entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the 
light most favorable to the Government.”).

Statutes § 796.07,2 and to one count of solicitation of minors to engage 
in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.03.3  He agreed to 
receive a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment on the two 
charges. In consideration of Epstein’s agreement, the NPA states that 
“the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but 
not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia 
Marcinkova.”4 
2. Maxwell’s Indictment and Trial-Related Proceedings 
The Indictment filed against Maxwell contained eight counts, 
six of which proceeded to trial.5 Prior to the commencement of trial, 
Florida Statutes § 796.07 provides in relevant part:  
(2) It is unlawful:  
(f) To solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution, 
lewdness, or assignation. 
Florida Statutes § 796.03, which has since been repealed, provided in relevant part: “A 
person who procures for prostitution, or causes to be prostituted, any person who is under 
the age of 18 years commits a felony of the second degree.” 
A-178. 
Count One charged Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged Maxwell with enticement of a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charged Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charged Maxwell with 
transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking conspiracy, in 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page6 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page29 of 51

prospective jurors completed a lengthy questionnaire, with several 
questions raising issues relevant to the trial. Based on the completed 
questionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to proceed to in-
person voir dire. The District Court ultimately empaneled a jury. 
During the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the Government 
presented evidence of the repeated sexual abuse of six girls. At the 
conclusion of trial, on December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell 
guilty on all but one count.6  
Following the verdict, Juror 50 gave press interviews during 
which he stated that he was a survivor of child sexual abuse.7 In his 
answers to the written jury questionnaire, however, Juror 50 answered 
“no” to three questions asking whether he or a friend or family 
member had ever been the victim of a crime; whether he or a friend or 
family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family member 
had ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking of a minor, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. Counts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell 
with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The perjury charges were severed from the 
remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing. 
The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. Maxwell was 
acquitted on Count Two. 
Consistent with a juror anonymity order entered for trial, the parties and the District Court 
referred to the jurors by pseudonym.

assault.8 Upon learning of the interviews, the Government filed a letter 
on January 5, 2022, requesting a hearing; Maxwell then moved for a 
new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. On March 8, 
2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified—under 
grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to 
sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the 
answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not 
affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50’s testimony 
to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a new 
trial in a written order.   
Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment to be followed by five years’ supervised release, and the 
Question 2 asked “[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim 
of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the 
victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or 
attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, 
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked  
[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, 
sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of 
law or informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual 
assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, 
supervisor, teacher, or family member.

District Court imposed a $750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory special 
assessment. This appeal followed. 
II.  DISCUSSION 
1. The NPA Between Epstein and USAO-SDFL Did Not Bar 
Maxwell’s Prosecution by USAO-SDNY 
Maxwell sought dismissal of the charges in the Indictment on the 
grounds that the NPA made between Epstein and USAO-SDFL 
immunized her from prosecution on all counts as a third-party 
beneficiary of the NPA. The District Court denied the motion, rejecting 
Maxwell’s arguments. We agree. We review de novo the denial of a 
motion to dismiss an indictment.9  
In arguing that the NPA barred her prosecution by USAO-SDNY, 
Maxwell cites the portion of the NPA in which “the United States [ ] 
agree[d] that it w[ould] not institute any criminal charges against any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”10 We hold that the NPA with 
USAO-SDFL does not bind USAO-SDNY. 
It is well established in our Circuit that “[a] plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which 
the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement 
See, e.g., United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22 (2d Cir. 2018).  
A-178. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page9 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page32 of 51

contemplates a broader restriction.”11 And while Maxwell contends 
that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed 
outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.12 Applying 
Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows 
that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where 
the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the 
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein 
fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district: 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 
and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been 
the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any 
United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circuits have 
been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 
1986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 550 (3d Cir. 2002). 
See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order) 
(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States 
v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered 
into in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only 
where subsequent charges are “suﬃciently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier 
agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that 
rested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause 
applied, the subsequent charges were “suﬃciently distinct” and therefore fell outside the 
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This Court did not, however, conclude that the 
rule of construction it announced depended on the similarities between earlier and 
subsequent charges. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page10 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page33 of 51

offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation 
will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein 
if any, will be dismissed.13  
The only language in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope is 
limiting language.  
The negotiation history of the NPA, just as the text, fails to show 
that the agreement was intended to bind other districts. Under our 
Court’s precedent, the negotiation history of an NPA can support an 
inference that an NPA “affirmatively” binds other districts.14 Yet, the 
actions of USAO-SDFL do not indicate that the NPA was intended to 
bind other districts.  
The United States Attorney’s Manual that was operable during 
the negotiations of the NPA required that:  
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any 
agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind any other 
district(s) or division without the express written approval of 
A-175 (emphasis added). The agreement’s scope is also limited in an additional section:  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these oﬀenses shall be 
deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein 
abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth 
below.  
Id. (emphasis added). 
See United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).   
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page11 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page34 of 51

the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.15 
Nothing before us indicates that USAO-SDNY had been notified or 
had approved of Epstein’s NPA with USAO-SDFL and intended to be 
bound by it. And the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division stated in an interview with the Office of Professional 
Responsibility that she “played no role” in the NPA, either by 
reviewing or approving the agreement. 
The history of the Office of the United States Attorney is instructive 
as to the scope of their actions and duties. The Judiciary Act of 1789 
created the Office of the United States Attorney, along with the office 
of the Attorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided 
for the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to 
act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn 
or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall 
be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, 
cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil 
actions in which the United States shall be concerned.”16 The Judiciary 
Act thus emphasized that U.S. Attorneys would enforce the law of the 
United States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S. 
Attorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact, 
the phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of 
United States Attorney’s Manual § 9-27.641 (2007).  
An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 20, § 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 
(1789) (emphasis added). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page12 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page35 of 51

the actions and the duties of the U.S. Attorneys would be limited to 
their own districts, absent any express exceptions. 
Since 1789, while the number of federal districts has grown 
significantly, the duties of a U.S. Attorney and their scope remain 
largely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Attorneys, “within [their] district, 
shall (1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States; (2) 
prosecute or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or 
proceedings in which the United States is concerned.”17 Again, the 
scope of the duties of a U.S. Attorney is cabined to their specific district 
unless otherwise directed.18 
In short, Annabi controls the result here.  Nothing in the text of 
the NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded 
USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the 
28 U.S.C. § 547.  
This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Attorney’s powers do not 
extend beyond their districts. For instance, under 28 U.S.C. § 515 a U.S. Attorney can 
represent the Government or participate in proceedings in other districts, but only when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General:  
The Attorney General or any other oﬃcer of the Department of Justice, or any 
attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General under law, may, when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding 
. . . which United States attorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not 
he is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought.

Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s 
motion without an evidentiary hearing. 
2. The Indictment Is Timely 
Maxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment 
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and 
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided 
by § 3283.19 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot 
apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of 
limitations to those offenses that were committed before the enactment 
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that 
the District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the 
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to 
dismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.20 
First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly 
applied Weingarten v. United States.21 In Weingarten, we explained that 
Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific 
18 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution for an oﬀense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child 
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for 
ten years after the oﬀense, whichever is longer.”  
United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2018).  
865 F.3d 48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 313-
(S.D.N.Y. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page14 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page37 of 51

approach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”22 We see no reason 
to depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question 
presented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual 
abuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the 
case. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that 
she had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a 
minor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283 
applies to those oﬀenses.  
Second, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the 
Indictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the 
extended statute of limitations provided by the 2003 amendment to 
§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding 
whether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether 
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.”23 If 
Congress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the 
The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to 
look “only to the statutory deﬁnitions of the prior oﬀenses, and not to the particular facts 
underlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United 
States, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of 
the conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach. 
See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-60. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] . . . reaches beyond the 
oﬀense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the oﬀense.” Id. at 59-60. Second, 
legislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 60. 
Third, a case-speciﬁc approach would not produce practical diﬃculties or potential 
unfairness. Id.  
511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994); see also Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55.  
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page15 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page38 of 51

statute as it is written.”24 If the statute “is ambiguous or contains no 
express command regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must 
determine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would 
create presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.”25 
Here, the inquiry is straightforward.  In 2003, Congress 
amended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would 
otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall 
preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”26 The text of 
§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it 
prevent the application of any statute of limitations that would 
otherwise apply to past conduct.   
The statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend 
the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as 
the prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to 
conclude that the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 applies to 
Maxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.

3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying 
Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial 
Maxwell contends that she was deprived of her constitutional right 
to a fair and impartial jury because Juror 50 failed to accurately 
respond to several questions related to his history of sexual abuse as 
part of the jury questionnaire during jury selection. Following a special 
evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a 
new trial.  
We review a District Court’s denial of a motion for a new trial for 
abuse of discretion.27 We have been extremely reluctant to “haul jurors 
in after they have reached a verdict in order to probe for potential 
instances of bias, misconduct or extraneous influences.”28 While courts 
can “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice 
so requires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), they should do so “sparingly” and 
only in “the most extraordinary circumstances.”29 A district court “has 
See Rivas v. Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d Cir. 1996). “[W]e are mindful that a judge has 
not abused her discretion simply because she has made a diﬀerent decision than we would 
have made in the ﬁrst instance.” United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2001). 
We have repeatedly explained that the term of art “abuse of discretion” includes errors of 
law, a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or “a decision that cannot be located 
within the range of permissible decisions.” In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  
United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1210, 1234 (2d Cir. 1983).

broad discretion to decide Rule 33 motions based upon its evaluation 
of the proof produced” and is shown deference on appeal.30  
A Rule 33 motion based on a juror’s alleged erroneous response 
during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood.31 Under McDonough, a party seeking a new trial “must first 
demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question 
on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have 
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”32 
The District Court applied the McDonough standard, found Juror 
50’s testimony credible, and determined that Juror 50’s erroneous 
responses during voir dire were “not deliberately incorrect” and that 
“he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate 
responses to the questionnaire.”33 In fact, as the District Court noted, 
Maxwell did not challenge the inclusion of other jurors who disclosed 
past experience with sexual abuse, assault, or harassment. This is 
United States v. Gambino, 59 F.3d 353, 364 (2d Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
464 U.S. 548 (1984).  
Id. at 556. 
A-340 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court reminds us that “[t]o invalidate the result 
of a [ ] trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist 
on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.” 
McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.

enough; the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s motion for a new trial.34   
4. The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result 
in a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance 
from, the Allegations in the Indictment 
During jury deliberations, the jury sent the following jury note 
regarding Count Four of the Indictment: 
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the 
transportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to 
New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in 
sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second 
element?35 
The District Court determined that it would not respond to the note 
directly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and 
instead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.36 
Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 50 rather than allowing the parties to 
do so. In conducting a hearing on potential juror misconduct, “[w]e leave it to the district 
court’s discretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning 
the witnesses, and whether to hold the hearing in camera.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 
540, 544 (2d Cir. 1989). And while Maxwell contends that the District Court improperly 
limited questioning about Juror 50’s role in deliberations, she both waived that argument 
below and fails to show here how any such questioning would not be foreclosed by Federal 
Rule of Evidence 606(b).   
A-238.  
A-207-221. The District Court’s instruction on the second element of Count Four required 
the jury to ﬁnd that “Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page19 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page42 of 51

Maxwell subsequently filed a letter seeking reconsideration of the 
District Court’s response, claiming that this response resulted in a 
constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. The District Court 
declined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion. 
Maxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the 
alleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that 
testimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the 
jury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the 
charges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this 
testimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.  We 
disagree and affirm the District Court’s denial.  
We review the denial of a motion claiming constructive 
amendment or prejudicial variance de novo.37 To satisfy the Fifth 
Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the 
elements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the 
charge against which he must defend.”38 We have explained that to 
prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must 
demonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by 
the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify 
essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial 
intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a 
criminal oﬀense in violation of New York law.” A-205. 
See United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146, 149 (2d Cir. 2018). 
United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page20 of 26

likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense 
other than that charged in the indictment.”39 A constructive 
amendment requires reversal.40 
We cannot conclude that a constructive amendment resulted 
from the evidence presented by the Government—namely, Jane’s 
testimony—or that it can be implied from the jury note. We have 
permitted significant flexibility in proof as long as a defendant was 
“given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”41 In turn, 
“[t]he core of criminality of an offense involves the essence of a crime, 
in general terms; the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime 
falls outside that purview.”42 
We agree with the District Court that the jury instructions, the 
evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s summation 
captured the core of criminality. As the District Court noted, while the 
jury note was ambiguous in one sense, it was clear that it referred to 
the second element of Count Four of the Indictment. Therefore, the 
District Court correctly directed the jury to that instruction, which 
“accurately instructed that Count Four had to be predicated on finding 
United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. 1988).  
See United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 417 (2d Cir. 2012).

omitted).

a violation of New York law.”43 It is therefore not “uncertain whether 
[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand 
jury’s indictment.”44 
We also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially 
varied from the Indictment. To allege a variance, a defendant “must 
establish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the 
evidence alleged in the indictment.”45 To prevail and win reversal, the 
defendant must further show “that substantial prejudice occurred at 
trial as a result” of the variance.46 “A defendant cannot demonstrate 
that he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the 
proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character 
that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the 
variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be 
protected against another prosecution for the same offense.”47 
For reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the 
constructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts 
A-387; see United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The trial judge is in the 
best position to sense whether the jury is able to proceed properly with its deliberations, 
and [ ] has considerable discretion in determining how to respond to communications 
indicating that the jury is experiencing confusion.”)

Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page45 of 51

“materially different” from the allegations in the Indictment.48 The 
evidence indicated that Maxwell transported Jane to New York for 
sexual abuse and conspired to do the same. Maxwell knew that the 
evidence also included conduct in New Mexico.49 Furthermore, 
Maxwell cannot demonstrate “substantial prejudice.” Maxwell 
received—over three weeks before trial—notes of Jane’s interview 
recording the abuse she suffered in New Mexico. This is enough to 
conclude that Maxwell was not “unfairly and substantially” 
prejudiced.50 
5. Maxwell’s Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable 
Lastly, Maxwell argues that her sentence was procedurally 
unreasonable because the District Court erred in applying a leadership 
sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines and 
inadequately explained its above-Guidelines sentence.51  We disagree.   
Dove, 884 F.3d at 149.  
As the District Court found, “[t]he Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls in New York. In service of this scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein 
and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at various properties and in various 
states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.” A-393. 
See United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that a defendant was 
not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed the 
evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). 
At sentencing, the District Court calculated a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ 
imprisonment and sentenced Maxwell to a slightly above-Guidelines term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page23 of 26
Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page46 of 51

We review a sentence for both procedural and substantive 
reasonableness, which “amounts to review for abuse of discretion.”52  
We have explained that procedural error is found when a district court 
“fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines 
range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider 
the [Section] 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly 
erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.”53 
The District Court did none of that. It is important to emphasize that 
the Sentencing Guidelines “are guidelines—that is, they are truly 
advisory.”54 A District Court is “generally free to impose sentences 
outside the recommended range” based on its own “informed and 
individualized judgment.”55 
With respect to the four-level leadership enhancement, the District 
Court found that Maxwell “supervised” Sarah Kellen in part because 
of testimony from two of Epstein’s pilots who testified that Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant. The District Court found that testimony credible, 
in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell 
was Epstein’s “number two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach, 
United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 187 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). “Regardless of whether 
the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must 
review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 
38, 51 (2007).  
United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 38 (2d Cir. 2012). 
Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189.

Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page47 of 51

where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked.56 We 
therefore hold that the District Court did not err in applying the 
leadership enhancement. 
With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court 
properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the 
sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell’s “pivotal role in 
facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of 
deceptive tactics.”57 The District Court recognized that the sentence 
“must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell’s conduct, of Ms. Maxwell’s 
offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the 
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.”58 And the District Court 
explained that “a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary 
to achieve the purposes of punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In 
sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its 
sentence.

1.  The District Court did not err in holding that Epstein’s NPA 
with USAO-SDFL did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution by USAO-

was filed within the statute of limitations.  
3. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. 
4. The District Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a 
constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the 
allegations in the Indictment.

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). She was principally sentenced to 
concurrent terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 
months, respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of 
supervised release. 
On appeal, the questions presented are whether (1) Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida barred Maxwell’s 
prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York; (2) a second superseding indictment of March 
29, 2021, complied with the statute of limitations; (3) the District Court 
abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new 
trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a 
fair and impartial jury; (4) the District Court’s response to a jury note 
resulted in a constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, 
the allegations in the second superseding indictment; and (5) 
Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this 
complex case, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, judgment 
of conviction.

JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). The District Court imposed concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 months, 
respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of supervised release 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page3 of 26

of three years, three years, and five years, respectively. The District 
Court also imposed a fine of $250,000 on each count for a total of 
$750,000. 
On appeal, the questions presented are (1) whether Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) 
barred Maxwell’s prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office 
for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”); (2) whether 
Maxwell’s second superseding indictment of March 29, 2021 (the 
“Indictment”) complied with the statute of limitations; (3) whether the 
District Court abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 
motion for a new trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth 
Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District 
Court’s response to a jury note resulted in a constructive amendment 
of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the Indictment; and 
(5) whether Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable. 
We hold that Epstein’s NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY as the NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY.  We hold 
that Maxwell’s Indictment complied with the statute of limitations as 
U.S.C. § 3283 extended the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for 
offenses committed before the date of the statute’s enactment. We 
further hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on one juror’s 
erroneous answers during voir dire. We also hold that the District 
Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a constructive 
amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page4 of 26

Indictment. Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is procedurally 
reasonable. 
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction. 
I.  BACKGROUND 1 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage 
girls. Starting in 1994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to 
engage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with 
these young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual 
topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2004, this pattern of sexual abuse 
continued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in 
various locations in the United States. 
1. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement  
In September 2007, following state and federal investigations 
into allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered 
into an NPA with USAO-SDFL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida 
Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial 
and described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678 
F.3d 208, 210-11 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction 
entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the 
light most favorable to the Government.”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page5 of 26

Statutes § 796.07,2 and to one count of solicitation of minors to engage 
in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.03.3  He agreed to 
receive a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment on the two 
charges. In consideration of Epstein’s agreement, the NPA states that 
“the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but 
not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia 
Marcinkova.”4 
2. Maxwell’s Indictment and Trial-Related Proceedings 
The Indictment filed against Maxwell contained eight counts, 
six of which proceeded to trial.5 Prior to the commencement of trial, 
Florida Statutes § 796.07 provides in relevant part:  
(2) It is unlawful:  
(f) To solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution, 
lewdness, or assignation. 
Florida Statutes § 796.03, which has since been repealed, provided in relevant part: “A 
person who procures for prostitution, or causes to be prostituted, any person who is under 
the age of 18 years commits a felony of the second degree.” 
A-178. 
Count One charged Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged Maxwell with enticement of a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charged Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charged Maxwell with 
transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking conspiracy, in 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page6 of 26

prospective jurors completed a lengthy questionnaire, with several 
questions raising issues relevant to the trial. Based on the completed 
questionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to proceed to in-
person voir dire. The District Court ultimately empaneled a jury. 
During the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the Government 
presented evidence of the repeated sexual abuse of six girls. At the 
conclusion of trial, on December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell 
guilty on all but one count.6  
Following the verdict, Juror 50 gave press interviews during 
which he stated that he was a survivor of child sexual abuse.7 In his 
answers to the written jury questionnaire, however, Juror 50 answered 
“no” to three questions asking whether he or a friend or family 
member had ever been the victim of a crime; whether he or a friend or 
family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family member 
had ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking of a minor, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. Counts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell 
with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The perjury charges were severed from the 
remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing. 
The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. Maxwell was 
acquitted on Count Two. 
Consistent with a juror anonymity order entered for trial, the parties and the District Court 
referred to the jurors by pseudonym. 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page7 of 26

assault.8 Upon learning of the interviews, the Government filed a letter 
on January 5, 2022, requesting a hearing; Maxwell then moved for a 
new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. On March 8, 
2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified—under 
grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to 
sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the 
answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not 
affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50’s testimony 
to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a new 
trial in a written order.   
Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment to be followed by five years’ supervised release, and the 
Question 2 asked “[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim 
of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the 
victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or 
attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, 
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked  
[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, 
sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of 
law or informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual 
assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, 
supervisor, teacher, or family member. 
See A-299, A-310. 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page8 of 26

District Court imposed a $750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory special 
assessment. This appeal followed. 
II.  DISCUSSION 
1. The NPA Between Epstein and USAO-SDFL Did Not Bar 
Maxwell’s Prosecution by USAO-SDNY 
Maxwell sought dismissal of the charges in the Indictment on the 
grounds that the NPA made between Epstein and USAO-SDFL 
immunized her from prosecution on all counts as a third-party 
beneficiary of the NPA. The District Court denied the motion, rejecting 
Maxwell’s arguments. We agree. We review de novo the denial of a 
motion to dismiss an indictment.9  
In arguing that the NPA barred her prosecution by USAO-SDNY, 
Maxwell cites the portion of the NPA in which “the United States [ ] 
agree[d] that it w[ould] not institute any criminal charges against any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”10 We hold that the NPA with 
USAO-SDFL does not bind USAO-SDNY. 
It is well established in our Circuit that “[a] plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which 
the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement 
See, e.g., United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22 (2d Cir. 2018).  
A-178. 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page9 of 26

contemplates a broader restriction.”11 And while Maxwell contends 
that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed 
outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.12 Applying 
Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows 
that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where 
the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the 
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein 
fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district: 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 
and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been 
the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any 
United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circuits have 
been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 
1986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 550 (3d Cir. 2002). 
See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order) 
(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States 
v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered 
into in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only 
where subsequent charges are “suﬃciently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier 
agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that 
rested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause 
applied, the subsequent charges were “suﬃciently distinct” and therefore fell outside the 
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This Court did not, however, conclude that the 
rule of construction it announced depended on the similarities between earlier and 
subsequent charges. 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page10 of 26

offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation 
will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein 
if any, will be dismissed.13  
The only language in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope is 
limiting language.  
The negotiation history of the NPA, just as the text, fails to show 
that the agreement was intended to bind other districts. Under our 
Court’s precedent, the negotiation history of an NPA can support an 
inference that an NPA “affirmatively” binds other districts.14 Yet, the 
actions of USAO-SDFL do not indicate that the NPA was intended to 
bind other districts.  
The United States Attorney’s Manual that was operable during 
the negotiations of the NPA required that:  
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any 
agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind any other 
district(s) or division without the express written approval of 
A-175 (emphasis added). The agreement’s scope is also limited in an additional section:  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these oﬀenses shall be 
deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein 
abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth 
below.  
Id. (emphasis added). 
See United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).   
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page11 of 26

the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.15 
Nothing before us indicates that USAO-SDNY had been notified or 
had approved of Epstein’s NPA with USAO-SDFL and intended to be 
bound by it. And the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division stated in an interview with the Office of Professional 
Responsibility that she “played no role” in the NPA, either by 
reviewing or approving the agreement. 
The history of the Office of the United States Attorney is instructive 
as to the scope of their actions and duties. The Judiciary Act of 1789 
created the Office of the United States Attorney, along with the office 
of the Attorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided 
for the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to 
act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn 
or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall 
be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, 
cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil 
actions in which the United States shall be concerned.”16 The Judiciary 
Act thus emphasized that U.S. Attorneys would enforce the law of the 
United States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S. 
Attorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact, 
the phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of 
United States Attorney’s Manual § 9-27.641 (2007).  
An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 20, § 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 
(1789) (emphasis added). 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page12 of 26

the actions and the duties of the U.S. Attorneys would be limited to 
their own districts, absent any express exceptions. 
Since 1789, while the number of federal districts has grown 
significantly, the duties of a U.S. Attorney and their scope remain 
largely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Attorneys, “within [their] district, 
shall (1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States; (2) 
prosecute or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or 
proceedings in which the United States is concerned.”17 Again, the 
scope of the duties of a U.S. Attorney is cabined to their specific district 
unless otherwise directed.18 
In short, Annabi controls the result here.  Nothing in the text of 
the NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded 
USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the 
28 U.S.C. § 547.  
This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Attorney’s powers do not 
extend beyond their districts. For instance, under 28 U.S.C. § 515 a U.S. Attorney can 
represent the Government or participate in proceedings in other districts, but only when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General:  
The Attorney General or any other oﬃcer of the Department of Justice, or any 
attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General under law, may, when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding 
. . . which United States attorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not 
he is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought. 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page13 of 26

Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s 
motion without an evidentiary hearing. 
2. The Indictment Is Timely 
Maxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment 
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and 
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided 
by § 3283.19 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot 
apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of 
limitations to those offenses that were committed before the enactment 
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that 
the District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the 
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to 
dismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.20 
First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly 
applied Weingarten v. United States.21 In Weingarten, we explained that 
Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific 
18 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution for an oﬀense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child 
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for 
ten years after the oﬀense, whichever is longer.”  
United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2018).  
865 F.3d 48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 313-
(S.D.N.Y. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page14 of 26

approach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”22 We see no reason 
to depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question 
presented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual 
abuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the 
case. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that 
she had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a 
minor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283 
applies to those oﬀenses.  
Second, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the 
Indictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the 
extended statute of limitations provided by the 2003 amendment to 
§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding 
whether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether 
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.”23 If 
Congress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the 
The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to 
look “only to the statutory deﬁnitions of the prior oﬀenses, and not to the particular facts 
underlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United 
States, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of 
the conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach. 
See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-60. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] . . . reaches beyond the 
oﬀense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the oﬀense.” Id. at 59-60. Second, 
legislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 60. 
Third, a case-speciﬁc approach would not produce practical diﬃculties or potential 
unfairness. Id.  
511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994); see also Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55.  
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page15 of 26

statute as it is written.”24 If the statute “is ambiguous or contains no 
express command regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must 
determine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would 
create presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.”25 
Here, the inquiry is straightforward.  In 2003, Congress 
amended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would 
otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall 
preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”26 The text of 
§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it 
prevent the application of any statute of limitations that would 
otherwise apply to past conduct.   
The statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend 
the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as 
the prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to 
conclude that the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 applies to 
Maxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.

3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying 
Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial 
Maxwell contends that she was deprived of her constitutional right 
to a fair and impartial jury because Juror 50 failed to accurately 
respond to several questions related to his history of sexual abuse as 
part of the jury questionnaire during jury selection. Following a special 
evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a 
new trial.  
We review a District Court’s denial of a motion for a new trial for 
abuse of discretion.27 We have been extremely reluctant to “haul jurors 
in after they have reached a verdict in order to probe for potential 
instances of bias, misconduct or extraneous influences.”28 While courts 
can “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice 
so requires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), they should do so “sparingly” and 
only in “the most extraordinary circumstances.”29 A district court “has 
See Rivas v. Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d Cir. 1996). “[W]e are mindful that a judge has 
not abused her discretion simply because she has made a diﬀerent decision than we would 
have made in the ﬁrst instance.” United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2001). 
We have repeatedly explained that the term of art “abuse of discretion” includes errors of 
law, a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or “a decision that cannot be located 
within the range of permissible decisions.” In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

broad discretion to decide Rule 33 motions based upon its evaluation 
of the proof produced” and is shown deference on appeal.30  
A Rule 33 motion based on a juror’s alleged erroneous response 
during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood.31 Under McDonough, a party seeking a new trial “must first 
demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question 
on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have 
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”32 
The District Court applied the McDonough standard, found Juror 
50’s testimony credible, and determined that Juror 50’s erroneous 
responses during voir dire were “not deliberately incorrect” and that 
“he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate 
responses to the questionnaire.”33 In fact, as the District Court noted, 
Maxwell did not challenge the inclusion of other jurors who disclosed 
past experience with sexual abuse, assault, or harassment. This is

marks omitted).

A-340 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court reminds us that “[t]o invalidate the result 
of a [ ] trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist 
on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.”

enough; the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s motion for a new trial.34   
4. The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result 
in a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance 
from, the Allegations in the Indictment 
During jury deliberations, the jury sent the following jury note 
regarding Count Four of the Indictment: 
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the 
transportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to 
New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in 
sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second 
element?35 
The District Court determined that it would not respond to the note 
directly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and 
instead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.36 
Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 50 rather than allowing the parties to 
do so. In conducting a hearing on potential juror misconduct, “[w]e leave it to the district 
court’s discretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning 
the witnesses, and whether to hold the hearing in camera.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 
540, 544 (2d Cir. 1989). And while Maxwell contends that the District Court improperly 
limited questioning about Juror 50’s role in deliberations, she both waived that argument 
below and fails to show here how any such questioning would not be foreclosed by Federal 
Rule of Evidence 606(b).   
A-238.  
A-207-221. The District Court’s instruction on the second element of Count Four required 
the jury to ﬁnd that “Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page19 of 26

Maxwell subsequently filed a letter seeking reconsideration of the 
District Court’s response, claiming that this response resulted in a 
constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. The District Court 
declined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion. 
Maxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the 
alleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that 
testimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the 
jury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the 
charges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this 
testimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.  We 
disagree and affirm the District Court’s denial.  
We review the denial of a motion claiming constructive 
amendment or prejudicial variance de novo.37 To satisfy the Fifth 
Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the 
elements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the 
charge against which he must defend.”38 We have explained that to 
prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must 
demonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by 
the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify 
essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial 
intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a 
criminal oﬀense in violation of New York law.” A-205. 
See United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146, 149 (2d Cir. 2018). 
United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page20 of 26

likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense 
other than that charged in the indictment.”39 A constructive 
amendment requires reversal.40 
We cannot conclude that a constructive amendment resulted 
from the evidence presented by the Government—namely, Jane’s 
testimony—or that it can be implied from the jury note. We have 
permitted significant flexibility in proof as long as a defendant was 
“given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”41 In turn, 
“[t]he core of criminality of an offense involves the essence of a crime, 
in general terms; the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime 
falls outside that purview.”42 
We agree with the District Court that the jury instructions, the 
evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s summation 
captured the core of criminality. As the District Court noted, while the 
jury note was ambiguous in one sense, it was clear that it referred to 
the second element of Count Four of the Indictment. Therefore, the 
District Court correctly directed the jury to that instruction, which 
“accurately instructed that Count Four had to be predicated on finding

See United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 417 (2d Cir. 2012).

Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page21 of 26

a violation of New York law.”43 It is therefore not “uncertain whether 
[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand 
jury’s indictment.”44 
We also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially 
varied from the Indictment. To allege a variance, a defendant “must 
establish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the 
evidence alleged in the indictment.”45 To prevail and win reversal, the 
defendant must further show “that substantial prejudice occurred at 
trial as a result” of the variance.46 “A defendant cannot demonstrate 
that he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the 
proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character 
that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the 
variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be 
protected against another prosecution for the same offense.”47 
For reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the 
constructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts 
A-387; see United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The trial judge is in the 
best position to sense whether the jury is able to proceed properly with its deliberations, 
and [ ] has considerable discretion in determining how to respond to communications 
indicating that the jury is experiencing confusion.”)

“materially different” from the allegations in the Indictment.48 The 
evidence indicated that Maxwell transported Jane to New York for 
sexual abuse and conspired to do the same. Maxwell knew that the 
evidence also included conduct in New Mexico.49 Furthermore, 
Maxwell cannot demonstrate “substantial prejudice.” Maxwell 
received—over three weeks before trial—notes of Jane’s interview 
recording the abuse she suffered in New Mexico. This is enough to 
conclude that Maxwell was not “unfairly and substantially” 
prejudiced.50 
5. Maxwell’s Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable 
Lastly, Maxwell argues that her sentence was procedurally 
unreasonable because the District Court erred in applying a leadership 
sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines and 
inadequately explained its above-Guidelines sentence.51  We disagree.   
Dove, 884 F.3d at 149.  
As the District Court found, “[t]he Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls in New York. In service of this scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein 
and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at various properties and in various 
states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.” A-393. 
See United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that a defendant was 
not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed the 
evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). 
At sentencing, the District Court calculated a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ 
imprisonment and sentenced Maxwell to a slightly above-Guidelines term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment. 
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page23 of 26

We review a sentence for both procedural and substantive 
reasonableness, which “amounts to review for abuse of discretion.”52  
We have explained that procedural error is found when a district court 
“fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines 
range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider 
the [Section] 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly 
erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.”53 
The District Court did none of that. It is important to emphasize that 
the Sentencing Guidelines “are guidelines—that is, they are truly 
advisory.”54 A District Court is “generally free to impose sentences 
outside the recommended range” based on its own “informed and 
individualized judgment.”55 
With respect to the four-level leadership enhancement, the District 
Court found that Maxwell “supervised” Sarah Kellen in part because 
of testimony from two of Epstein’s pilots who testified that Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant. The District Court found that testimony credible, 
in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell 
was Epstein’s “number two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach, 
United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 187 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). “Regardless of whether 
the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must 
review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 
38, 51 (2007).  
United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 38 (2d Cir. 2012). 
Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189. 
Id.  
Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page24 of 26

where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked.56 We 
therefore hold that the District Court did not err in applying the 
leadership enhancement. 
With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court 
properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the 
sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell’s “pivotal role in 
facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of 
deceptive tactics.”57 The District Court recognized that the sentence 
“must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell’s conduct, of Ms. Maxwell’s 
offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the 
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.”58 And the District Court 
explained that “a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary 
to achieve the purposes of punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In 
sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its 
sentence.  
CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we hold as follows: 
A-417. 
SA-459.

1.  The District Court did not err in holding that Epstein’s NPA 
with USAO-SDFL did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution by USAO-
SDNY. 
2. The District Court did not err in holding that the Indictment 
was filed within the statute of limitations.  
3. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. 
4. The District Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a 
constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the 
allegations in the Indictment.  
5. The District Court’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 
29, 2022, judgment of conviction.
