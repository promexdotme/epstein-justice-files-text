Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page1 of 26

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). She was principally sentenced to 
concurrent terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 
months, respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of 
supervised release. 
On appeal, the questions presented are whether (1) Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida barred Maxwell’s 
prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York; (2) a second superseding indictment of March 
29, 2021, complied with the statute of limitations; (3) the District Court 
abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new 
trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a 
fair and impartial jury; (4) the District Court’s response to a jury note 
resulted in a constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, 
the allegations in the second superseding indictment; and (5) 
Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this 
complex case, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, judgment 
of conviction.

JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was 
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b)(2). The District Court imposed concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240 months, 
respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of supervised release 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page3 of 26

of three years, three years, and five years, respectively. The District 
Court also imposed a fine of $250,000 on each count for a total of 
$750,000. 
On appeal, the questions presented are (1) whether Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) 
barred Maxwell’s prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office 
for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”); (2) whether 
Maxwell’s second superseding indictment of March 29, 2021 (the 
“Indictment”) complied with the statute of limitations; (3) whether the 
District Court abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 
motion for a new trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth 
Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District 
Court’s response to a jury note resulted in a constructive amendment 
of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the Indictment; and 
(5) whether Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable. 
We hold that Epstein’s NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY as the NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY.  We hold 
that Maxwell’s Indictment complied with the statute of limitations as 
U.S.C. § 3283 extended the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for 
offenses committed before the date of the statute’s enactment. We 
further hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on one juror’s 
erroneous answers during voir dire. We also hold that the District 
Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a constructive 
amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the allegations in the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page4 of 26

Indictment. Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is procedurally 
reasonable. 
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, 
judgment of conviction. 
I.  BACKGROUND 1 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage 
girls. Starting in 1994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to 
engage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with 
these young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual 
topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2004, this pattern of sexual abuse 
continued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in 
various locations in the United States. 
1. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement  
In September 2007, following state and federal investigations 
into allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered 
into an NPA with USAO-SDFL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida 
Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial 
and described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678 
F.3d 208, 210-11 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction 
entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the 
light most favorable to the Government.”). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page5 of 26

Statutes § 796.07,2 and to one count of solicitation of minors to engage 
in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.03.3  He agreed to 
receive a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment on the two 
charges. In consideration of Epstein’s agreement, the NPA states that 
“the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but 
not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia 
Marcinkova.”4 
2. Maxwell’s Indictment and Trial-Related Proceedings 
The Indictment filed against Maxwell contained eight counts, 
six of which proceeded to trial.5 Prior to the commencement of trial, 
Florida Statutes § 796.07 provides in relevant part:  
(2) It is unlawful:  
(f) To solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution, 
lewdness, or assignation. 
Florida Statutes § 796.03, which has since been repealed, provided in relevant part: “A 
person who procures for prostitution, or causes to be prostituted, any person who is under 
the age of 18 years commits a felony of the second degree.” 
A-178. 
Count One charged Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged Maxwell with enticement of a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charged Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charged Maxwell with 
transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking conspiracy, in 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page6 of 26

prospective jurors completed a lengthy questionnaire, with several 
questions raising issues relevant to the trial. Based on the completed 
questionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to proceed to in-
person voir dire. The District Court ultimately empaneled a jury. 
During the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the Government 
presented evidence of the repeated sexual abuse of six girls. At the 
conclusion of trial, on December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell 
guilty on all but one count.6  
Following the verdict, Juror 50 gave press interviews during 
which he stated that he was a survivor of child sexual abuse.7 In his 
answers to the written jury questionnaire, however, Juror 50 answered 
“no” to three questions asking whether he or a friend or family 
member had ever been the victim of a crime; whether he or a friend or 
family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, or sexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family member 
had ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex traﬃcking of a minor, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. Counts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell 
with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The perjury charges were severed from the 
remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing. 
The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. Maxwell was 
acquitted on Count Two. 
Consistent with a juror anonymity order entered for trial, the parties and the District Court 
referred to the jurors by pseudonym. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page7 of 26

assault.8 Upon learning of the interviews, the Government filed a letter 
on January 5, 2022, requesting a hearing; Maxwell then moved for a 
new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. On March 8, 
2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified—under 
grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to 
sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the 
answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not 
affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50’s testimony 
to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a new 
trial in a written order.   
Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment to be followed by five years’ supervised release, and the 
Question 2 asked “[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim 
of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the 
victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or 
attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, 
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked  
[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, 
sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of 
law or informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual 
assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, 
supervisor, teacher, or family member. 
See A-299, A-310. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page8 of 26

District Court imposed a $750,000 fine and a $300 mandatory special 
assessment. This appeal followed. 
II.  DISCUSSION 
1. The NPA Between Epstein and USAO-SDFL Did Not Bar 
Maxwell’s Prosecution by USAO-SDNY 
Maxwell sought dismissal of the charges in the Indictment on the 
grounds that the NPA made between Epstein and USAO-SDFL 
immunized her from prosecution on all counts as a third-party 
beneficiary of the NPA. The District Court denied the motion, rejecting 
Maxwell’s arguments. We agree. We review de novo the denial of a 
motion to dismiss an indictment.9  
In arguing that the NPA barred her prosecution by USAO-SDNY, 
Maxwell cites the portion of the NPA in which “the United States [ ] 
agree[d] that it w[ould] not institute any criminal charges against any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”10 We hold that the NPA with 
USAO-SDFL does not bind USAO-SDNY. 
It is well established in our Circuit that “[a] plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which 
the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement 
See, e.g., United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22 (2d Cir. 2018).  
A-178. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page9 of 26

contemplates a broader restriction.”11 And while Maxwell contends 
that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed 
outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.12 Applying 
Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution 
by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows 
that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where 
the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the 
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein 
fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district: 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 
and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been 
the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any 
United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circuits have 
been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 
1986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 550 (3d Cir. 2002). 
See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order) 
(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States 
v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered 
into in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only 
where subsequent charges are “suﬃciently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier 
agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that 
rested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause 
applied, the subsequent charges were “suﬃciently distinct” and therefore fell outside the 
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This Court did not, however, conclude that the 
rule of construction it announced depended on the similarities between earlier and 
subsequent charges. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page10 of 26

offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation 
will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein 
if any, will be dismissed.13  
The only language in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope is 
limiting language.  
The negotiation history of the NPA, just as the text, fails to show 
that the agreement was intended to bind other districts. Under our 
Court’s precedent, the negotiation history of an NPA can support an 
inference that an NPA “affirmatively” binds other districts.14 Yet, the 
actions of USAO-SDFL do not indicate that the NPA was intended to 
bind other districts.  
The United States Attorney’s Manual that was operable during 
the negotiations of the NPA required that:  
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any 
agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind any other 
district(s) or division without the express written approval of 
A-175 (emphasis added). The agreement’s scope is also limited in an additional section:  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these oﬀenses shall be 
deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein 
abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth 
below.  
Id. (emphasis added). 
See United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).   
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page11 of 26

the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.15 
Nothing before us indicates that USAO-SDNY had been notified or 
had approved of Epstein’s NPA with USAO-SDFL and intended to be 
bound by it. And the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division stated in an interview with the Office of Professional 
Responsibility that she “played no role” in the NPA, either by 
reviewing or approving the agreement. 
The history of the Office of the United States Attorney is instructive 
as to the scope of their actions and duties. The Judiciary Act of 1789 
created the Office of the United States Attorney, along with the office 
of the Attorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided 
for the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to 
act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn 
or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall 
be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, 
cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil 
actions in which the United States shall be concerned.”16 The Judiciary 
Act thus emphasized that U.S. Attorneys would enforce the law of the 
United States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S. 
Attorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact, 
the phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of 
United States Attorney’s Manual § 9-27.641 (2007).  
An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 20, § 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93 
(1789) (emphasis added). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page12 of 26

the actions and the duties of the U.S. Attorneys would be limited to 
their own districts, absent any express exceptions. 
Since 1789, while the number of federal districts has grown 
significantly, the duties of a U.S. Attorney and their scope remain 
largely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Attorneys, “within [their] district, 
shall (1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States; (2) 
prosecute or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or 
proceedings in which the United States is concerned.”17 Again, the 
scope of the duties of a U.S. Attorney is cabined to their specific district 
unless otherwise directed.18 
In short, Annabi controls the result here.  Nothing in the text of 
the NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded 
USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the 
28 U.S.C. § 547.  
This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Attorney’s powers do not 
extend beyond their districts. For instance, under 28 U.S.C. § 515 a U.S. Attorney can 
represent the Government or participate in proceedings in other districts, but only when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General:  
The Attorney General or any other oﬃcer of the Department of Justice, or any 
attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General under law, may, when 
speciﬁcally directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding 
. . . which United States attorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not 
he is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page13 of 26

Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s 
motion without an evidentiary hearing. 
2. The Indictment Is Timely 
Maxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment 
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and 
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided 
by § 3283.19 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot 
apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of 
limitations to those offenses that were committed before the enactment 
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that 
the District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the 
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to 
dismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.20 
First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly 
applied Weingarten v. United States.21 In Weingarten, we explained that 
Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific 
18 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution for an oﬀense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child 
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for 
ten years after the oﬀense, whichever is longer.”  
United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2018).  
865 F.3d 48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 313-
(S.D.N.Y. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page14 of 26

approach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”22 We see no reason 
to depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question 
presented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual 
abuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the 
case. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that 
she had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a 
minor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283 
applies to those oﬀenses.  
Second, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the 
Indictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the 
extended statute of limitations provided by the 2003 amendment to 
§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding 
whether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether 
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.”23 If 
Congress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the 
The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to 
look “only to the statutory deﬁnitions of the prior oﬀenses, and not to the particular facts 
underlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United 
States, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of 
the conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach. 
See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-60. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] . . . reaches beyond the 
oﬀense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the oﬀense.” Id. at 59-60. Second, 
legislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly. Id. at 60. 
Third, a case-speciﬁc approach would not produce practical diﬃculties or potential 
unfairness. Id.  
511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994); see also Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55.  
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page15 of 26

statute as it is written.”24 If the statute “is ambiguous or contains no 
express command regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must 
determine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would 
create presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.”25 
Here, the inquiry is straightforward.  In 2003, Congress 
amended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would 
otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall 
preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”26 The text of 
§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude 
prosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it 
prevent the application of any statute of limitations that would 
otherwise apply to past conduct.   
The statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend 
the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as 
the prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to 
conclude that the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 applies to 
Maxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.

3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying 
Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial 
Maxwell contends that she was deprived of her constitutional right 
to a fair and impartial jury because Juror 50 failed to accurately 
respond to several questions related to his history of sexual abuse as 
part of the jury questionnaire during jury selection. Following a special 
evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a 
new trial.  
We review a District Court’s denial of a motion for a new trial for 
abuse of discretion.27 We have been extremely reluctant to “haul jurors 
in after they have reached a verdict in order to probe for potential 
instances of bias, misconduct or extraneous influences.”28 While courts 
can “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice 
so requires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), they should do so “sparingly” and 
only in “the most extraordinary circumstances.”29 A district court “has 
See Rivas v. Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d Cir. 1996). “[W]e are mindful that a judge has 
not abused her discretion simply because she has made a diﬀerent decision than we would 
have made in the ﬁrst instance.” United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2001). 
We have repeatedly explained that the term of art “abuse of discretion” includes errors of 
law, a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or “a decision that cannot be located 
within the range of permissible decisions.” In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  
United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1210, 1234 (2d Cir. 1983).

broad discretion to decide Rule 33 motions based upon its evaluation 
of the proof produced” and is shown deference on appeal.30  
A Rule 33 motion based on a juror’s alleged erroneous response 
during voir dire is governed by McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. 
Greenwood.31 Under McDonough, a party seeking a new trial “must first 
demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question 
on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have 
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”32 
The District Court applied the McDonough standard, found Juror 
50’s testimony credible, and determined that Juror 50’s erroneous 
responses during voir dire were “not deliberately incorrect” and that 
“he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate 
responses to the questionnaire.”33 In fact, as the District Court noted, 
Maxwell did not challenge the inclusion of other jurors who disclosed 
past experience with sexual abuse, assault, or harassment. This is 
United States v. Gambino, 59 F.3d 353, 364 (2d Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
464 U.S. 548 (1984).  
Id. at 556. 
A-340 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court reminds us that “[t]o invalidate the result 
of a [ ] trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist 
on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.” 
McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page18 of 26

enough; the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s motion for a new trial.34   
4. The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result 
in a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance 
from, the Allegations in the Indictment 
During jury deliberations, the jury sent the following jury note 
regarding Count Four of the Indictment: 
Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the 
transportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to 
New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in 
sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second 
element?35 
The District Court determined that it would not respond to the note 
directly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and 
instead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.36 
Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 50 rather than allowing the parties to 
do so. In conducting a hearing on potential juror misconduct, “[w]e leave it to the district 
court’s discretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning 
the witnesses, and whether to hold the hearing in camera.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 
540, 544 (2d Cir. 1989). And while Maxwell contends that the District Court improperly 
limited questioning about Juror 50’s role in deliberations, she both waived that argument 
below and fails to show here how any such questioning would not be foreclosed by Federal 
Rule of Evidence 606(b).   
A-238.  
A-207-221. The District Court’s instruction on the second element of Count Four required 
the jury to ﬁnd that “Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page19 of 26

Maxwell subsequently filed a letter seeking reconsideration of the 
District Court’s response, claiming that this response resulted in a 
constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. The District Court 
declined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion. 
Maxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the 
alleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that 
testimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the 
jury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the 
charges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this 
testimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.  We 
disagree and affirm the District Court’s denial.  
We review the denial of a motion claiming constructive 
amendment or prejudicial variance de novo.37 To satisfy the Fifth 
Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the 
elements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the 
charge against which he must defend.”38 We have explained that to 
prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must 
demonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by 
the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify 
essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial 
intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a 
criminal oﬀense in violation of New York law.” A-205. 
See United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146, 149 (2d Cir. 2018). 
United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2021). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page20 of 26

likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense 
other than that charged in the indictment.”39 A constructive 
amendment requires reversal.40 
We cannot conclude that a constructive amendment resulted 
from the evidence presented by the Government—namely, Jane’s 
testimony—or that it can be implied from the jury note. We have 
permitted significant flexibility in proof as long as a defendant was 
“given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”41 In turn, 
“[t]he core of criminality of an offense involves the essence of a crime, 
in general terms; the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime 
falls outside that purview.”42 
We agree with the District Court that the jury instructions, the 
evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s summation 
captured the core of criminality. As the District Court noted, while the 
jury note was ambiguous in one sense, it was clear that it referred to 
the second element of Count Four of the Indictment. Therefore, the 
District Court correctly directed the jury to that instruction, which 
“accurately instructed that Count Four had to be predicated on finding 
United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. 1988).  
See United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 417 (2d Cir. 2012).  
United States v. Ionia Mgmt. S.A., 555 F.3d 303, 310 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (emphasis 
omitted). 
D'Amelio, 683 F.3d at 418 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page21 of 26

a violation of New York law.”43 It is therefore not “uncertain whether 
[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand 
jury’s indictment.”44 
We also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially 
varied from the Indictment. To allege a variance, a defendant “must 
establish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the 
evidence alleged in the indictment.”45 To prevail and win reversal, the 
defendant must further show “that substantial prejudice occurred at 
trial as a result” of the variance.46 “A defendant cannot demonstrate 
that he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the 
proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character 
that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the 
variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be 
protected against another prosecution for the same offense.”47 
For reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the 
constructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts 
A-387; see United States v. Parker, 903 F.2d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The trial judge is in the 
best position to sense whether the jury is able to proceed properly with its deliberations, 
and [ ] has considerable discretion in determining how to respond to communications 
indicating that the jury is experiencing confusion.”)

Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page22 of 26

“materially different” from the allegations in the Indictment.48 The 
evidence indicated that Maxwell transported Jane to New York for 
sexual abuse and conspired to do the same. Maxwell knew that the 
evidence also included conduct in New Mexico.49 Furthermore, 
Maxwell cannot demonstrate “substantial prejudice.” Maxwell 
received—over three weeks before trial—notes of Jane’s interview 
recording the abuse she suffered in New Mexico. This is enough to 
conclude that Maxwell was not “unfairly and substantially” 
prejudiced.50 
5. Maxwell’s Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable 
Lastly, Maxwell argues that her sentence was procedurally 
unreasonable because the District Court erred in applying a leadership 
sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines and 
inadequately explained its above-Guidelines sentence.51  We disagree.   
Dove, 884 F.3d at 149.  
As the District Court found, “[t]he Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls in New York. In service of this scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein 
and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at various properties and in various 
states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.” A-393. 
See United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that a defendant was 
not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed the 
evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). 
At sentencing, the District Court calculated a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ 
imprisonment and sentenced Maxwell to a slightly above-Guidelines term of 240 months’ 
imprisonment. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page23 of 26

We review a sentence for both procedural and substantive 
reasonableness, which “amounts to review for abuse of discretion.”52  
We have explained that procedural error is found when a district court 
“fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines 
range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider 
the [Section] 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly 
erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.”53 
The District Court did none of that. It is important to emphasize that 
the Sentencing Guidelines “are guidelines—that is, they are truly 
advisory.”54 A District Court is “generally free to impose sentences 
outside the recommended range” based on its own “informed and 
individualized judgment.”55 
With respect to the four-level leadership enhancement, the District 
Court found that Maxwell “supervised” Sarah Kellen in part because 
of testimony from two of Epstein’s pilots who testified that Kellen was 
Maxwell’s assistant. The District Court found that testimony credible, 
in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell 
was Epstein’s “number two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach, 
United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 187 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). “Regardless of whether 
the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must 
review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 
38, 51 (2007).  
United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 38 (2d Cir. 2012). 
Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189. 
Id.  
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page24 of 26

where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked.56 We 
therefore hold that the District Court did not err in applying the 
leadership enhancement. 
With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court 
properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the 
sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell’s “pivotal role in 
facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of 
deceptive tactics.”57 The District Court recognized that the sentence 
“must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell’s conduct, of Ms. Maxwell’s 
offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the 
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.”58 And the District Court 
explained that “a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary 
to achieve the purposes of punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In 
sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its 
sentence.  
CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we hold as follows: 
A-417. 
SA-459. 
SA-461. 
Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page25 of 26

1.  The District Court did not err in holding that Epstein’s NPA 
with USAO-SDFL did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution by USAO-
SDNY. 
2. The District Court did not err in holding that the Indictment 
was filed within the statute of limitations.  
3. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. 
4. The District Court’s response to a jury note did not result in a 
constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from, the 
allegations in the Indictment.  
5. The District Court’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.  
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 
29, 2022, judgment of conviction.

__________________________
PETITIONER’S AMENDED APPLICATION TO EXTEND TIME
TO FILE PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI
___________________________
To the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor, as Circuit Justice for the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit:
1.
Petitioner Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully requests that the time to file a
Petition for a Writ of Certiorari in this case be extended for forty five days to April 10, 2025. 
The court of appeals issued the Order denying the Petition for Rehearing/Rehearing En Banc
on November 25, 2024.  Absent an extension of time, the petition would be due on Monday,
February 24, 2025.  Petitioner is filing this Application at least ten days before the due date. 
See S.Ct. R. 13-5.  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1). 
2.
Petitioner seeks review of the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit based on substantial questions relating to that court’s resolution of
petitioner’s appeal.  Specifically, the Second Circuit’s opinion acknowledged that it

deepened a circuit split on whether a plea agreement is binding on federal prosecutors in 
districts other than the one in which it is entered.  See United States v. Maxwell, 118 F. 4th
256 n.11 (2nd Cir. 2024) (“recogniz[ing] that circuits have been split on this issue”).  
3.
Undersinged counsel was just retained yesterday, on January 14, 2024.  Due
to case-related and other reasons, additional time is necessary and warranted for counsel to
research the decisional conflicts, and prepare a clear, concise, and comprehensive petition
for certiorari for the Court’s review.  The press of other matters makes the submission of the
petition difficult absent an extension, especially because Petitioner engaged undersigned
counsel just this week to represent her in the Supreme Court. For example, Counsel is
scheduled to commence a multi-defendant trial on March 3, 2025, United States v. Diego
Sanudo Sanchez Chocron, Southern District of Florida, case number 24-cr-20155-RAR(s).
In addition, counsel is due to file a reply brief in this Court in Elizabeth Peters Young v.
United States, case number 24-571, shortly after the Goverment files its response on January
22, 2025.  
Therefore, because of the importance of this issue, and the need to draft a meaningful
petition on such short notice, undersigned counsel is respectfully requesting an additional 45
days in the matter to file until April 10, 2025.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the time to file a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari in this
matter should be extended forty five days to and including April 10, 2025.

          Re:  Ghislaine Maxwell v. United States of America,  
                  S.Ct. No. 24-1073 
Dear Mr. Harris: 
The petition for a writ of certiorari in the above-captioned case was filed on April 10, 2025, and 
placed on the docket on April 14, 2025. The government’s response is due on May 14, 2025. 
We respectfully request, under Rule 30.4 of the rules of this Court, an extension of time to and 
including June 13, 2025, within which to file the government’s response. 
This extension is requested to complete preparation of the government’s response, which was 
delayed because of the heavy press of earlier assigned cases to the attorneys handling this matter. 
Sincerely,

INTEREST OF AMICI1
The National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers (NACDL) is a nonprofit voluntary professional 
bar association that works on behalf of criminal defendants 
to ensure justice and due process for those accused of 
crime or misconduct. Founded in 1958, NACDL has a 
nationwide membership of thousands of direct members 
and up to 40,000 affiliates. NACDL’s members include 
private criminal defense lawyers, public defenders, 
military defense counsel, law professors, and judges. 
NACDL is the only nationwide professional bar association 
for public defenders and criminal defense lawyers. 
NACDL is dedicated to advancing the proper, efficient, 
and fair administration of justice. NACDL files numerous 
amicus briefs each year in this Court and other federal and 
state courts, seeking to provide assistance in cases that 
present issues of broad importance to criminal defendants, 
criminal defense lawyers, and the criminal justice system 
as a whole. Given their prevalence, the interpretation 
of plea agreements is a question of great importance to 
NACDL and the clients its members represent. NACDL 
is well positioned to provide additional insight into the 
implications of this issue for criminal defendants across 
the country. 
1.  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states 
that no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part 
and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its members, 
or its counsel, made any monetary contribution intended to fund 
the preparation or submission of this brief. Pursuant to Supreme 
Court Rule 37.2, amicus curiae provided notice to the parties.

INTRODUCTION AND 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Defendants in criminal cases rely on the promises 
made by the Department of Justice when deciding whether 
to plead guilty and face the life-altering consequences 
of doing so. The government’s promises, made in return 
for demanding the defendant’s waiver of constitutional 
rights, should be rigorously enforced. Yet the lower court 
permitted the government to escape its promises and 
incorrectly limited the scope of the non-prosecution and 
plea agreement (NPA) well beyond its plain language. 
The intentionally broad scope of this NPA may be 
surprising in retrospect but that does not change the 
words on the page. Indeed, a survey of plea agreements 
from across the country shows that the Department of 
Justice knows how to limit a plea agreement’s reach to 
a single prosecutorial district rather than making it a 
nationwide restriction against future prosecution. Where, 
as here, the “United States . . . agrees that it will not 
institute any criminal charges against any potential co-
conspirators” (App. 31a), without imposing any geographic 
limitation, no part of the Department of Justice may 
institute criminal charges against any co-conspirator in 
any district. 
The Department of Justice directs prosecutors to be 
careful when exercising their authority to bind the entire 
Department but there is no question that prosecutors 
have the authority to do so. That they rarely exercise 
this authority is not a ground for invalidating it, quite 
the opposite. 

Amicus NACDL urges the Court to grant this petition 
and resolve the conflict among the circuits to ensure that 
the government keeps its promises. 
ARGUMENT
The Department of Justice (the “Department”) 
routinely limits the scope of its plea agreements to the 
specific United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) that is a 
party to the agreement. Prosecutors in other districts and 
other parts of the Department could therefore later charge 
the defendant for the same or related conduct. Where, 
as here, the government chooses not to adopt limiting 
language, a court should not negate its bargained-for 
promise to the defendant and instead enforce the language 
as written. Amicus urges the Court to grant the petition 
to resolve the split among the circuits and ensure that 
defendants and their counsel can rely on the promises 
made by the United States in its written agreements. 
1.	 Defendants should be able to rely on the government’s 
promises and courts should not hesitate to enforce 
them.
Like any party to any contract, defendants in criminal 
cases rely on the promises made by the Department. And 
defendants give up a lot in return. A defendant entering 
into a plea agreement forgoes his constitutional right to a 
trial by jury and right to appeal, faces the near certainty 
of a prison sentence and loss of freedom, agrees to pay 
financial penalties through fines and forfeiture, and faces 
the myriad collateral effects of a criminal conviction after 
serving the sentence. 

“The reality is that plea bargains have become so 
central to the administration of the criminal justice 
system that defense counsel have responsibilities in the 
plea bargain process, responsibilities that must be met to 
render the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth 
Amendment requires in the criminal process at critical 
stages.” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. 134, 143 (2012). That 
responsibility, borne by NACDL’s members, requires 
defense counsel to explain the benefits and drawbacks of 
a plea agreement to their clients. 
As a practical matter, every criminal defendant 
hopes that a plea agreement will end their exposure 
to future prosecution for the same or related conduct. 
Defense counsel must explain to their clients that while 
a plea agreement ensures that the client is not charged 
for the same or related conduct in that district, most plea 
agreements expose the client to prosecution in other 
districts. It creates an impossible situation if defense 
counsel must now explain to their clients that the court 
may later excuse the Department from its promises. 
Guilty pleas must be knowing and voluntary. 
McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466 (1969). As 
the Court has explained, “[i]t is precisely because the 
plea was knowing and voluntary . . . that the Government 
is obligated to uphold its side of the bargain.” Puckett v. 
United States, 556 U.S. 129, 137–38 (2009). A “guilty plea 
is a grave and solemn act to be accepted only with care and 
discernment.” Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 
(1970). A plea “is more than an admission of past conduct; 
it is the defendant’s consent that judgment of conviction 
may be entered without a trial—a waiver of his right to 
trial before a jury or a judge. Waivers of constitutional 

rights not only must be voluntary but must be knowing, 
intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the 
relevant circumstances and likely consequences.” Id. A 
defendant, however, cannot have “sufficient awareness 
of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences” 
of a plea agreement if the United States can change the 
plain language of the agreement down the road without 
the defendant’s consent.
Likewise, a court cannot discharge its crucial role 
in the plea process if it does not know whether to trust 
United States’ words. The court is not a rubber stamp 
in the plea process. Rather, the Rule 11(b)-mandated 
plea colloquy “is designed to assist the district judge in 
making the constitutionally required determination that 
a defendant’s guilty plea is truly voluntary.” McCarthy, 
394 U.S. at 465. The court, through this colloquy, must 
personally interrogate the defendant on the record to 
ensure that a plea is voluntary in part by establishing 
that the plea agreement contains all promises made to 
the defendant in return for his consent to plead guilty. 
See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(2) (“Before accepting a plea 
of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the 
defendant personally in open court and determine that the 
plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, 
or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement).”). 
This case involves an unusually broad non-prosecution 
agreement. But nothing in the law permits the United 
States to break its promises simply because the promise 
is an atypical one. 
During plea negotiations, the Department wields 
extraordinary leverage as compared to a criminal 

defendant. Even the most ably represented defendant 
cannot overcome this unequal balance of power. The 
government’s substantial “advantage in bargaining 
power” means that ambiguities like this one must be 
construed against the government. United States v. 
Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 552 (3d Cir. 2002). 
Defense counsel confront their clients’ unequal 
bargaining power every time they attempt to obtain 
a resolution that is in the best interest of their client 
while mollifying a prosecutor who has little institutional 
incentive to be lenient. Judge Charles Breyer accurately 
described the process: 
It is no answer to say that [the defendant] is 
striking a deal with the Government, and could 
reject this term if he wanted to, because that 
statement does not reflect the reality of the 
bargaining table. See Erik Luna & Marianne 
Wade, Prosecutors as Judges, 67 Wash. & Lee 
L. Rev. 1413, 1414–15 (2010). As to terms such 
as this one, plea agreements are contracts of 
adhesion. The Government offers the defendant 
a deal, and the defendant can take it or leave it. 
Id. (“American prosecutors . . . choose whether 
to engage in plea negotiations and the terms 
of an acceptable agreement.”). If he leaves it, 
he does so at his peril. And the peril is real, 
because on the other side of the offer is the 
enormous power of the United States Attorney 
to investigate, to order arrests, to bring a case 
or to dismiss it, to recommend a sentence or 
the conditions of supervised release, and on 

and on. See Robert H. Jackson, The Federal 
Prosecutor, 24 J. Am. Judicature Soc’y 18, 18 
(1940).
United States v. Osorto, 445 F. Supp. 3d 103, 109 (N.D. 
Cal. 2020). 
To permit the United States to escape the plain 
language of its agreement in this case would work a 
detriment on the entire plea system. This is of particular 
concern given that the criminal justice system “is for 
the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.” 
Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. at 143–44. For the plea system 
to work in practice, defense counsel and defendants must 
be able to rely on the written promises made by the 
government and trust that courts will honor and enforce 
those promises down the road, even when it means that 
the Department must forego a meritorious prosecution. 
Consider a situation where a defendant agrees to 
plead guilty to a violent felony that will bring substantial 
prison time. He agrees to plead only because the 
“United States” promises in writing that it will not 
charge any co-conspirators in the offense, including the 
defendant’s brother, and because the plea agreement 
contains no geographic or other limitation on that 
promise. The defendant should be able to rely on the 
government’s bargained-for promise that he alone will 
suffer incarceration. And a prosecutor in a different 
district must not be permitted to charge his brother with 
conspiracy to commit the same offense. 

2.	 The Department of Justice knows how to draft plea 
agreements to bind only part of the Department in 
future prosecutions.
As the trial court correctly noted, “[s]ingle district 
plea agreements are the norm.” (App. 56a) A survey of 
plea agreements from districts across the county reveals 
that the Department of Justice routinely drafts plea 
agreements with this limited single-district scope. 
Here are examples from districts across the country:
Middle District of Alabama: “The defendant 
understands that this agreement binds only the Office 
of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of 
Alabama and that the agreement does not bind any other 
component of the United States Department of Justice, 
nor does it bind any state or local prosecuting authority.” 
United States v. McIntyre, No. 1:24-cr-00211, ECF No. 
(Dec. 19, 2024), at 14. 
Northern District of Alabama: “The Defendant 
understands and agrees that this Agreement does not bind 
any other United States Attorney in any other district, 
or any other state or local authority.” United States v. 
Giaquinto, No. 2:22-cr-00035-MHH-GMB, ECF No. 326 
(Nov. 18, 2024), at 13. 
Eastern District of California: “This plea agreement 
is limited to the United States Attorney’s Office for 
the Eastern District of California and cannot bind any 
other federal, state, or local prosecuting, administrative, 
or regulatory authorities.” United States v. Amani 
Investments, No. 2:23-cr-00014-JAM, ECF No. 8 (E.D. 
Cal. Feb. 7, 2023), at 1. 

Central District of California: “This agreement 
is limited to the [Central District of California] USAO 
and cannot bind any other federal, state, local, or foreign 
prosecuting, enforcement, administrative, or regulatory 
authorities.” United States v. Koo, No. 2:23-cr-00568-
DSF-1, ECF No. 8 (Nov. 20, 2023), at 1. 
District of Colorado: “This agreement binds only the 
Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office 
for the District of Colorado and the defendant.” United 
States v. Chuong, No. 1:21-cr-00164, ECF No. 67 (July 7, 
2022), at 1. 
District of Columbia: “Your client further understands 
that this Agreement is binding only upon the Criminal and 
Superior Court Divisions of the United States Attorney’s 
Office for the District of Columbia as well as the Criminal 
Division’s Public Integrity Section. This Agreement does 
not bind the Civil Division of this Office or any other 
United States Attorney’s Office, nor does it bind any 
other state, local, or federal prosecutor.” United States 
v. Patel, No. 1:19-cr-00081-RDM, ECF No. 4 (April 4, 
2019), at 11–12. 
Northern District of Georgia: “The United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia 
agrees not to bring further criminal charges against the 
Defendant related to the charges to which he is pleading 
guilty. The Defendant understands that this provision does 
not bar prosecution by any other federal, state, or local 
jurisdiction.” United States v. Woods, No. 1:23-cr-00064, 
ECF No. 8-1 (Mar. 3, 2023), at 4. 
Southern District of Indiana: “This document and 
the addendum constitute the complete and only Plea 

Agreement between the Defendant, the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, and the 
Civil Rights Division and is binding only on the parties to 
the agreement, supersede all prior understandings, if any, 
whether written or oral, and cannot be modified except 
in writing, signed by all parties and filed with the Court, 
or on the record in open court.” United States v. Gibson, 
No. 1:20-cr-00094, ECF No. 148 (Mar. 30, 2022), at 17. 
Eastern District of Michigan: “The Defendant 
understands and agrees that this Agreement is between 
the Fraud Section and the Defendant and does not 
bind any other division or section of the Department of 
Justice or any other federal, state, or local prosecuting, 
administrative, or regulatory authority.” United States 
v. Sterling Bancorp, Inc., No. 2:23-cr-20174-LVP-DRG, 
ECF No. 12 (May 18, 2023), at 4. 
District of Minnesota: “This Plea Agreement 
binds only the Defendant and the Antitrust Division of 
the United States Department of Justice. . . . This Plea 
Agreement does not bind any other state or federal 
agency.” United States v. Detloff Marketing and Asset 
Management, Inc., No. 18-cr-00197-PAM-HB, ECF No. 
(July 25, 2019), at 1. 
Eastern District of Missouri: “This agreement does 
not, and is not intended to, bind any governmental office 
or agency other than the United States Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Missouri.” United States v. Malik, 
No. 4:24-cr-00010-HEA, ECF No. 127 (Apr. 4, 2023), at 1. 
Eastern District of New York: “The Defendants 
understand and agree that this Agreement is among 

the Office [Eastern District of New York USAO], the 
NSD [National Security Division of the United States 
Department of Justice], and the Defendants, and does 
not bind any other division or section of the Department 
of Justice or any other federal, state, local or foreign 
prosecuting, administrative or regulatory authority.” 
United States v. Lafarge S.A., No. 1:22-cr-00444-WFK, 
ECF No. 10 (Oct. 18, 2022), at 3. 
District of New Jersey: “This agreement is limited

States v. Barnes, No. 3:19-cr-00112-K, ECF No. 355 (Apr. 
1, 2022), at 7.
3.	 The consistent practice of USAOs to limit the scope 
of plea agreements stands in stark contrast to the 
scope of the NPA here.
The trial court correctly noted that “[n]ationwide, 
unlimited agreements are the rare exception.” (App. 
at 56a). The fact that this NPA is a “rare exception” 
to Department’s general practice does not void the 
agreement’s broad reach. In fact, the rarity of nationwide 
agreements is a persuasive reason to enforce it because 
there can be no question that the choice of language was 
intentional and a key part of the parties’ bargain. 
This situation is no different than a contractual 
provision that binds a corporate subsidiary and, by 
extension, the parent corporation. Unless the subsidiary 
plainly lacked authority to enter into the agreement, that 
provision is enforceable against the parent. Similarly, one 
USAO has the authority to bind the entire Department. 
“[T]he prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the 
spokesman for the Government. A promise made by one 
attorney must be attributed, for these purposes, to the 
Government.” Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 
(1972). 
Recognizing that one prosecutor can bind all 
prosecutor, the Justice Manual instructs prosecutors 
that non-prosecution agreements should “be drawn in 

terms that will not bind other federal prosecutors or 
agencies without their consent” and “the attorney for the 
government should explicitly limit the scope of his/her 
agreement to non-prosecution within his/her district.” 
Justice Manual § 9-27.630.3 Given this instruction, when 
Department attorneys choose to draft a broad agreement, 
the court should enforce it as written. The NPA’s broad 
language served the government’s strategy at the time 
of the agreement. The Court should not permit the 
government to escape that language, even if that strategy 
may seem unwise or unintelligible with the benefit of 
hindsight. 
CONCLUSION
The Court should grant review in this case to resolve 
the conflict among the circuits identified by petitioner and 
hold the Department of Justice to its word. 
Respectfully submitted,

Re:  Ghislaine Maxwell v. United States, No. 24-1073 
Dear Mr. Harris: 
The petition for a writ of certiorari in the above-captioned case was filed on April 10, 
2025, and placed on the docket on April 14, 2025.  The government’s response is now due, after 
one extension, on June 13, 2025.  We respectfully request, under Rule 30.4 of the Rules of this 
Court, a further extension of time to and including July 14, 2025, within which to file the 
government’s response. 
This extension is necessary because the attorneys with principal responsibility for 
preparation of the government’s response have been heavily engaged with the press of 
previously assigned matters with proximate due dates. 
Counsel for petitioner does not oppose this further extension. 
Sincerely, 
D. John Sauer

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, PETITIONER 
v. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI 
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS 
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION 
OPINIONS BELOW 
The opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-23a) 
is reported at 118 F.4th 256.  The order of the district 
court (Pet. App. 52a-91a) is reported at 534 F. Supp. 3d 
299. 
JURISDICTION 
The judgment of the court of appeals was entered on 
September 17, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was de-
nied on November 25, 2024 (Pet. App. 92a).  On January 
21, 2025, Justice Sotomayor extended the time within 
which to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and in-
cluding April 10, 2025, and the petition was filed on that 
date.  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 
U.S.C. 1254(1). 

STATEMENT 
Following a jury trial in the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York, petitioner 
was convicted on one count of conspiring to transport 
minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371; one count of transporting 
a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2423(a); and one count of sex 
trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1591(a) 
and (b)(2).  Pet. App. 3a, 39a-40a.  The district court sen-
tenced petitioner to 240 months of imprisonment, to be 
followed by five years of supervised release.  Id. at 41a-
42a.  The court of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 1a-23a. 
1. From about 1994 to 2004, petitioner “coordinated, 
facilitated, and contributed to” the multimillionaire fi-
nancier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of numerous 
young women and underage girls.  Pet. App. 4a.  The 
abuse followed a pattern.  Petitioner and Epstein would 
identify vulnerable girls living under difficult circum-
stances; isolate them from their friends and families, 
gaining their trust by giving them gifts and pretending 
to be their friends; normalize the discussion of sexual 
topics and sexual touching with the girls; and then 
“transition[] to sexual abuse, often through the pretext 
of [a girl] giving Epstein a massage.”  Gov’t C.A. Br. 5; 
see Pet. App. 4a, 94a.  Petitioner and Epstein paid vic-
tims large amounts of cash to provide Epstein with sex-
ualized massages, and after a victim had begun giving 
massages, they would offer her additional money to re-
cruit other girls.  Gov’t C.A. Br. 5-6.  
Petitioner and Epstein carried on those activities at, 
among other locations, Epstein’s residences in Palm 
Beach, Florida, and New York City.  See Gov’t C.A. Br. 

4-12. In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl com-
plained to the Palm Beach police after learning that Ep-
stein had paid their daughter for a massage.  Pet. App. 
94a.  The following year, a state grand jury indicted Ep-
stein for soliciting prostitution.  Ibid.  But because the 
local police “were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s 
handling of the case and believed that the state grand 
jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s 
conduct, they referred the matter to the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach.”  Ibid. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of Florida (Florida USAO) worked with the FBI “to de-
velop a federal case against Epstein.”  Pet. App. 94a.  “[I]n 
the course of the investigation, they discovered additional 
victims.”  Ibid.  An Assistant U.S. Attorney drafted a 60-
count indictment against Epstein and a “lengthy memo-
randum summarizing the evidence” against him.  Id. at 
94a-95a.  In 2007, however, the Florida USAO entered 
into a written nonprosecution agreement (NPA) with 
Epstein.  Id. at 5a, 24a-38a.   
The NPA began by describing the state and federal 
investigations into Epstein’s conduct and the potential 
federal charges that the investigation by the Florida 
USAO and FBI supported.  Pet. App. 24a-25a.  The agree-
ment noted that Epstein sought “to resolve globally his 
state and federal criminal liability.”  Id. at 25a.  It then 
provided:   
[O]n the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, 
prosecution in this District for [the federal] offenses 
shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State 
of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the fol-
lowing conditions and the requirements of this Agree-
ment set forth below. 

Id. at 26a.    
The NPA further specified that, if Epstein timely 
fulfilled all the terms and conditions of the agreement, 
no prosecution against him would “be instituted in this 
District.”  Pet. App. 26a.  The NPA then listed 13 terms, 
which principally required Epstein to plead guilty to 
two state offenses—soliciting prostitution and soliciting 
minors to engage in prostitution—and agree to a sen-
tence of 18 months of imprisonment.  Id. at 27a-30a.  A 
later provision stated that if Epstein “successfully ful-
fills all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, 
the United States also agrees that it will not institute 
any criminal char[g]es against any potential co-con-
spirators of Epstein, including but not limited to” four 
of Epstein’s assistants (none of whom was petitioner).  
Id. at 31a; see id. at 123a-124a; C.A. App. 178.    
Such a coconspirators clause was “ ‘highly unusual,’ ” 
Pet. App. 125a, and “appears to have been added ‘with 
little discussion or consideration by the prosecutors,’ ” 
id. at 55a (citation omitted).  During a later investiga-
tion into the Florida USAO’s handling of the Epstein 
matter, the Assistant U.S. Attorney who handled the 
case told the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Pro-
fessional Responsibility that she “did not consider the 
possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect” an-
yone other than the four named assistants.  Id. at 110a; 
see id. at 125a-126a.  And other USAO attorneys sug-
gested that the coconspirators clause was “meant to 
protect named co-conspirators who were also victims” 
of Epstein.  Id. at 125a. 
The coconspirators clause is not the only clause that 
refers to “the United States”; instead, the NPA refers 
variously to the “the United States Attorney,” “the 
United States Attorney’s Office,” and “the United 

States.”  Pet. App. 24a-38a.  For example, the NPA pro-
vides for “the United States Attorney” to send notice to 
Epstein if he “should determine, based on reliable evi-
dence,” that Epstein has violated the agreement, and 
specifies that the notice should be “provided  * * *  within 
days of the United States learning of facts which may 
provide a basis for a determination of a breach.”  Id. at 
26a.   
DOJ policy provided at that time—and similarly pro-
vides today—that “[n]o district or division shall make 
any agreement, including any agreement not to prose-
cute, which purports to bind any other district(s) or di-
vision without the express written approval of the United 
States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.”  
Pet. App. 10a (citation omitted); see Justice Manual 
§ 9-27.641 (Feb. 2018) (current version).  The NPA in  
Epstein’s case was signed by Epstein, his counsel, and—
under U.S. Attorney Acosta’s name—the aforemen-
tioned Assistant U.S. Attorney.  Pet. App. 36a-38a.   
In accordance with the NPA, Epstein pleaded guilty 
to two offenses in Florida state court in 2008.  Pet. App. 
96a.  He was incarcerated for about a year in a mini-
mum-security state facility.  Id. at 96a-98a.  But in 2019, 
the USAO for the Southern District of New York (New 
York USAO) obtained an indictment charging Epstein 
with sex trafficking minors.  Id. at 100a. 
2. In 2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of 
New York returned an indictment charging petitioner 
with several offenses arising out of her scheme with Ep-
stein.  Pet. App. 52a.  A second superseding and ulti-
mately operative indictment charged petitioner with six 
offenses related to facilitating sexual activity by minors 
and two counts of perjury.  C.A. App. 114-135.   

Petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing 
that the coconspirators clause of Epstein’s NPA, see p. 
4, supra, barred her prosecution because she was 
charged as Epstein’s coconspirator.  Pet. App. 55a.  The 
district court denied the motion, finding that the NPA 
bound only the Florida USAO.  Id. at 56a-58a.  The court 
further found that most of the charged offenses would 
have fallen outside the scope of the NPA even if it had 
applied to the New York USAO.  See id. at 59a-60a.1 
Petitioner was tried on the nonperjury counts in 
2021, Gov’t C.A. Br. 2, and the jury found her guilty on 
five counts, Pet. App. 39a.  The district court entered 
judgment on three of those counts, dismissed two on 
multiplicity grounds, and sentenced petitioner to 240 
months of imprisonment.  Id. at 39a-41a. 
3. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-23a.  
It rejected, among other claims, petitioner’s contention 
that Epstein’s NPA barred her prosecution.  Id. at 8a-
12a.  The court cited circuit precedent for the proposi-
tion that a “plea agreement binds only the office of the 
United States Attorney for the district in which the plea 
is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agree-
ment contemplates a broader restriction.”  Id. at 8a 
(quoting United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d 
Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  And here, the court found, 
“[n]o-thing in the text of the NPA or its negotiation his-
tory suggests that the NPA precluded USAO-SDNY 
from prosecuting Maxwell” for the charged offenses.  
Id. at 12a.   
The district court did not address whether the two counts that 
were added between the first and second superseding indictments 
would have fallen within the scope of the NPA.  See D. Ct. Doc. 317, 
at 2-5 (Aug. 13, 2021). 

The court of appeals observed that “[t]he only lan-
guage in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope 
is limiting language” referring specifically to the South-
ern District of Florida.  Pet. App. 10a; see id. at 9a-10a 
& n.13 (quoting language in the NPA protecting Epstein 
from charges “in this District”).  The court also found no 
indication that either the Southern District of New 
York or the Criminal Division had reviewed and ap-
proved the NPA, as DOJ policy would have required if 
the NPA applied to other districts.  See id. at 10a.  And 
the court recognized that, from the inception of the of-
fice in the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, § 35, 1 Stat. 92-
93, a U.S. Attorney’s authority had always been “cab-
ined to their specific district unless otherwise directed.”  
Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 11a-12a & n.18. 
ARGUMENT 
Petitioner renews her contention (Pet. 12-18) that 
Epstein’s nonprosecution agreement with the U.S. At-
torney for the Southern District of Florida barred peti-
tioner’s prosecution by the U.S. Attorney for the South-
ern District of New York.  That contention is incorrect, 
and petitioner does not show that it would succeed in 
any court of appeals.  This case would also be an unsuit-
able vehicle for addressing the matters raised in the pe-
tition for a writ of certiorari.  This Court has previously 
denied certiorari in a case raising a similar claim.  See 
Prisco v. United States, 562 U.S. 1290 (2011) (No. 10-
7895).  It should follow the same course here.   
1. The court of appeals correctly held that Epstein’s 
NPA did not bar petitioner’s prosecution.  Pet. App. 8a-
12a. 
a. Petitioner asserts (Pet. 1) that prosecution for one 
of her three counts of conviction was barred by a provision 
of Epstein’s NPA stating, in relevant part, that “the 

United States also agrees that it will not institute crim-
inal char[g]es against any potential co-conspirators of 
Epstein, including but not limited to” four of Epstein’s 
assistants.  Pet. App. 31a; see Pet. 3-4.  But “[n]onprose-
cution agreements, like plea bargains, are contractual 
in nature, and are therefore interpreted in accordance 
with general principles of contract law.”  United States 
v. Castaneda, 162 F.3d 832, 835 (5th Cir. 1998); cf. San-
tobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971).  And like 
other contracts, the NPA “must be read as a whole” and 
in proper context.  United States v. Moreno-Membache, 
995 F.3d 249, 256 (D.C. Cir. 2021). 
While “the United States” could conceivably refer to 
the entire federal government, as petitioner urges, the 
entirety and context of the NPA here make clear that 
the term is used—as it often is—as one alternative way 
to refer to the USAO executing the agreement.  See Pet. 
App. 56a (noting that “the United States” is “common 
shorthand” for the USAO); United States v. Trevino, 
556 F.2d 1265, 1271 (5th Cir. 1977) (interpreting “the 
United States” in a statute to mean “the prosecutorial 
division of the government”) (emphasis omitted); cf. 
United States v. Rourke, 74 F.3d 802, 807 (7th Cir.) 
(“within the criminal justice system throughout the 
country, the term ‘the government’ is widely used and 
understood to refer to the ‘prosecution,’ or ‘the United 
States Attorney’ ”), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1215 (1996).  
Among other things, the NPA invoked “the authority of 
R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida,” and listed only officials of 
that USAO in the signature block, Pet. App. 26a; see id. 
at 33a-34a, 36a-38a—showing that the agreement was 
with the USAO, not the entire DOJ.   

While petitioner emphasizes (Pet. 18) the paragraph 
stating that Epstein sought “to resolve globally his 
state and federal criminal liability,” Pet. App. 25a, even 
as to “his” federal liability specifically, the agreement 
by its terms protected him from federal prosecution 
only “in this District,” id. at  26a; see id. at 9a (court of 
appeals observing that “where the NPA is not silent, the 
agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the Southern 
District of Florida”).  The NPA’s coconspirators clause, 
which “also agrees” to forgo certain prosecution of co-
conspirators, cannot reasonably be construed as reflect-
ing some “global[]” scope broader than the Florida-
based state and federal charges that Epstein resolved 
for himself.  It would be extremely strange if the NPA 
left Epstein himself open to federal prosecution in an-
other district—as eventually occurred, see p. 5, supra—
while protecting his coconspirators from prosecution 
anywhere.   
Contrary to petitioner’s claim, such an implausible 
reading cannot be inferred simply because the cocon-
spirators clause is one of the places where “the United 
States” is used instead of “the United States Attorney” 
or “the United States Attorney’s Office.”  As noted above, 
the NPA variously referred to the U.S. Attorney, the 
USAO, and the United States, and at least some of those 
uses of “the United States” plainly referred specifically 
to the USAO.  See, e.g., Pet. App. 26a (using terms in-
terchangeably in paragraph on notice); id. at 30a (not-
ing that Epstein had “agree[d]” “[a]t the United States’ 
request” to provide certain information); cf. Kirtsaeng 
v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S. 519, 540 (2013) 
(“different words used in different parts of the same 
statute [can] mean roughly the same thing”).  The term 

did not take on some unique broader meaning in the co-
conspirators’ clause.  Cf. Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gar-
ner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 
170-173 (2012) (presumption of consistent usage). 
Moreover, even if the meaning of the coconspirators 
clause were not clear in context, extrinsic evidence 
would resolve the ambiguity against petitioner.  See 
United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 551 (3d Cir. 2002).  
At the time the NPA was negotiated, DOJ policy barred 
USAOs from entering into NPAs that bound other dis-
tricts unless they obtained the approval of those dis-
tricts or the Criminal Division.  Pet. App. 10a.  That pol-
icy reflects the longstanding general rule that a U.S. At-
torney’s area of responsibility is limited to “his district.”  
U.S.C. 547; see Pet. App. 11a-12a.  While petitioner 
suggests (Pet. 18) that USAOs are instructed to be ex-
plicit on that point, they are also instructed to consult 
with other DOJ components if they intend to altogether 
foreclose any prosecution by other USAOs.  See Justice 
Manual § 9-27.630.  And there is no indication here that 
anyone involved in negotiating Epstein’s NPA obtained 
the necessary approval for binding other USAOs or 
thought it was necessary.  Pet. App. 10a. 
b. Petitioner’s contrary arguments (Pet. 12-18) lack 
merit.  She invokes general principles that prosecutors 
should be held to the promises they make, see Pet. 13-
(discussing Santobello, supra, and Giglio v. United 
States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)), and that “ambiguities in a 
plea agreement are to be resolved against the govern-
ment,” Pet. 16.  But those arguments merely beg the 
questions of what promises the NPA did make and 
whether the NPA is ambiguous.  As explained above, 
the NPA’s coconspirators clause, read in context, is not 

reasonably susceptible to petitioner’s broad interpreta-
tion. 
Petitioner also invokes (Pet. 16-17) the interpretive 
principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius, in argu-
ing that the NPA’s “use of narrowing terms as to Ep-
stein’s protections” from prosecution indicates that the 
coconspirators clause, which does not contain those 
terms, was intended to apply to all districts.  But the 
expressio unius canon “grows weaker with each differ-
ence in the formulation of the provisions under inspec-
tion.” City of Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker 
Serv., Inc., 536 U.S. 424, 436 (2002); see Chevron U.S.A. 
Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 81 (2002) (“The canon 
depends on identifying a series of two or more terms or 
things that should be understood to go hand in hand, 
which is abridged in circumstances supporting a sensi-
ble inference that the term left out must have been 
meant to be excluded.”).  And the canon therefore does 
little work in this case.  
The relevant portions of the NPA do not have any 
sort of parallelism in their wording or structure that 
would suggest the necessity for identical terminology 
on this particular point.  Compare, e.g., Pet. App. 26a 
(“prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these of-
fenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the 
State of Florida”), with id. at 31a (“the United States also 
agrees that it will not institute any criminal char[g]es 
against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”).  In-
deed, as noted above, the phrasing of the coconspirators 
clause—in which “the United States also agrees” to 
forgo certain prosecution of coconspirators, id. at 31a 
(emphasis added)—plainly uses “the United States” in 
reference to the entity otherwise making the agreement 

(the USAO) and the corresponding geographic limita-
tions of that agreement, as reflected in its promises re-
garding the prosecution of Epstein himself.    
Petitioner’s remaining arguments are likewise mis-
placed.  Her effort (Pet. 15-16) to link the coconspira-
tors clause with other NPA provisions addressing  
potential civil suits under 18 U.S.C. 2255 (2006) is self-
defeating, since the latter provisions reinforce the 
NPA’s limitation to the Southern District of Florida.  
See Pet. App. 28a (providing that “Epstein will not con-
test the jurisdiction of the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of Florida” in such suits).  Sim-
ilarly unavailing is petitioner’s emphasis (Pet. 17) on 
language in one draft of the NPA that would have ex-
pressly limited the coconspirators’ protection to the 
Southern District of Florida.  See Pet. App. 117a.  There 
is no indication that anyone involved in drafting the 
NPA understood the different versions of the cocon-
spirators clause to have different geographic scopes.  
See id. at 122a-123a; see also id. at 125a n.125 (former 
First Assistant U.S. Attorney telling DOJ investigators 
that “the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other 
co-conspirators could have been prosecuted ‘by any 
other U.S. Attorney’s office in the country’ ”) (brackets 
omitted).  As the district court explained, an NPA “need 
not painstakingly spell out ‘the Office of the United 
States Attorney for Such-and-Such District’ in every in-
stance to make clear that it applies only in the district 
where signed.”  Id. at 56a-57a.   
At all events, the case-specific interpretation of a 
particular NPA is not a matter that warrants this 
Court’s review.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10.  And that is especially 
true where “district court and court of appeals are in 
agreement as to what conclusion the record requires.”  

Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 456-457 (1995) (Scalia, 
J., dissenting) (citing Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde 
Air Prods. Co., 336 U.S. 271, 275 (1949)). 
2. Petitioner nevertheless urges (Pet. 7-12) the Court 
to grant a writ of certiorari in this case to resolve as-
serted disagreement in the courts of appeals over how 
broadly references to “the United States” or “the gov-
ernment” in a plea agreement should be read.  That con-
tention is likewise misplaced. 
The Second and Seventh Circuits have stated that a 
promise regarding a defendant’s prosecution on behalf 
of “the government” or “the United States” by default 
“binds only the office of the United States Attorney for 
the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirm-
atively appears that the agreement contemplates a 
broader restriction.”  United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 
670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam); see Rourke, 74 F.3d 
at 807 & n.5 (7th Cir.).  And in the Third, Fourth, and 
Eighth Circuits, “when a United States Attorney  * * *  
contracts on behalf of ‘the United States’ or ‘the Gov-
ernment’ in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that 
attorney speaks for and binds all his or her fellow 
United States Attorneys  * * * absent express contrac-
tual limitations or disavowals to the contrary.”  Gebbie, 
294 F.3d at 550 (3d Cir.); see United States v. Carter, 
454 F.2d 426, 428 (4th Cir. 1972) (en banc), cert. denied, 
417 U.S. 933 (1974); United States v. Van Thournout, 
100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir. 1996).2 
Petitioner appears to acknowledge (Pet. 10-11) that the Ninth 
Circuit has not expressly addressed the matter at issue here.  In 
Thomas v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 35 F.3d 1332 
(1994), a cooperation agreement “plainly and unambiguously  * * *  
bound the INS,” id. at 1337, so no need existed to address a more 

Any disparity, however, is of limited importance be-
cause the scope of a plea or similar agreement is under 
the control of the parties to the agreement.  See Gebbie, 
294 F.3d at 550 n.4.  Accordingly, as the court of appeals 
cases cited in the petition for a writ of certiorari indi-
cate, cases in which a default inference proves to be dis-
positive are unlikely to arise frequently.  Indeed, several 
of the cited cases did not themselves require application 
of any default rule because the scope of the relevant 
agreement was clear.  See, e.g., Margalli-Olvera v. Im-
migration & Naturalization Serv., 43 F.3d 345, 352 (8th 
Cir. 1994); see also Rourke, 74 F.3d at 807.  And for the 
reasons discussed above, this is not itself a case that 
turns on any default rule.   
Even assuming that “the United States” were pre-
sumptively a reference to the entire federal govern-
ment, the scope of the NPA’s coconspirators clause 
would nonetheless be clear.  See Pet. App. 12a (court of 
appeals finding “[n]othing in the text of the NPA or its 
negotiation history” to support petitioner’s claim); id. at 
57a (district court describing petitioner’s reading as “not 
plausible—let alone ‘affirmatively apparent’ ”) (quoting 
Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672); pp. 8-12, supra.  This Court 
does not grant certiorari to “decide abstract questions 
of law  * * *  which, if decided either way, affect no 
right” of the parties.  Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 U.S. 
305, 311 (1882).  And it has declined to do so in the face 
of a claim similar to petitioner’s.  See Prisco, 562 U.S. 
at 1290; Br. in Opp. at 6, Prisco, supra (No. 10-7895) 
(explaining that “when read in context, the prosecutor’s 
general methodological question.  The same was true in United 
States v. Johnston, 199 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 
U.S. 1207 (2000), where a plea agreement explicitly bound only the 
USAO.  See id. at 1021. 

reference to ‘the government’ [at a plea hearing] clearly 
referred to only the United States Attorney for the Dis-
trict of New Jersey”).   
3. Indeed, this case would be an unsuitable candi-
date for further review for additional reasons as well.  
First, unlike the defendants in the cases cited in the pe-
tition for certiorari, petitioner was not a party to the 
relevant agreement; only Epstein and the Florida 
USAO were parties to the NPA.  Even assuming that a 
third party could assert rights under such an agreement 
with the government, but see United States v. Lopez, 
944 F.2d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting the absence of 
“authority to that effect”), petitioner could do so here 
only if “the original parties intended the contract to di-
rectly benefit [her] as [a] third part[y],” United States 
v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 663 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 
531 U.S. 1014 (2000); see Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa 
Clara County, 563 U.S. 110, 117 (2011).  But there is no 
evidence that the parties to the NPA intended for the 
coconspirators clause to benefit petitioner.  See p. 4, su-
pra.  The government was not even aware of petitioner’s 
role in Epstein’s scheme at that time.  See Pet. App. 
125a-126a.   
Second, even if the Florida USAO had purported to 
bind all other USAOs in the NPA, it would have lacked 
authority to do so.  See General Int. Ins. Co. v. Ruggles, 
U.S. (12 Wheat.) 408, 413 (1827) (“It is a general rule 
applicable to agencies of every description, that the 
agent cannot bind his principal, except in matters com-
ing within the scope of his authority.”).  Under DOJ pol-
icy at the time the Epstein NPA was entered, a USAO 
could bind other districts in an NPA only if it obtained 
the approval of those districts or the Criminal Division.  
Pet. App. 10a.  The USAO here did not do so.  Ibid.  And 

petitioner cannot make up for the absence of actual au-
thority by invoking principles of estoppel or apparent 
authority against the government.  See Federal Crop Ins. 
Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 384 (1947).  That is par-
ticularly true where she is, at most, an incidental third-
party beneficiary of the agreement.   
CONCLUSION 
The petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.

REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION .... 
I. 
The government concedes that the 
circuits are split as to whether a promise

II. 
The Second Circuit’s decision below is 
wrong and violates the principles set 
forth in this Court’s prior opinions. ......... 
III. This case is an ideal vehicle for resolving 
the split over this important and 
recurring question. ...................................

REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION 
This case presents a straightforward and important 
question about the government’s obligation to honor 
its promises in plea and non-prosecution agreements. 
The petition asks whether a U.S. Attorney’s promise 
made on behalf of “the United States” binds the entire 
United States. The government’s Brief in Opposition 
only underscores the importance of this question.  
Most significantly, the government concedes a 
circuit split on this issue, effectively admitting that 
defendants’ rights hinge on the happenstance of 
geography. Opp.13. Such an acknowledged conflict 
among the circuits demands this Court’s intervention.  
Rather than grapple with the core principles of plea 
agreements, the government tries to distract by 
reciting a lurid and irrelevant account of Jeffrey 
Epstein’s misconduct. But this case is about what the 
government promised, not what Epstein did. 
Even more remarkably, the government advances an 
interpretation of its non-prosecution agreement that 
flips its plain meaning on its head. Promising “not to 
prosecute” somehow meant preserving the right to 
prosecute. That is not contract interpretation; it is 
alchemy. Plea agreements are supposed to be strictly 
construed against the government, yet here the 
government isn’t even asking for the benefit of the 
doubt; it is asking for a blank check to rewrite its own 
promise after the fact. The government’s only real 
argument is that the Second Circuit rule is correct on 
the merits while the other circuits have it wrong. We 
obviously disagree, but regardless, the Court should 
grant certiorari so that all circuits employ that same rule. 

This circuit split presents an exceptionally important 
question. Plea and non-prosecution agreements resolve 
nearly every federal case. They routinely include 
promises that extend to others—co-conspirators, family 
members, potential witnesses. If those promises mean 
different things in different parts of the country, then 
trust in our system collapses. The Court should grant 
certiorari and restore consistency, and credibility, to 
the government’s word. 
I. The government concedes that the circuits 
are split as to whether a promise on behalf 
of the “United States” by a United States 
Attorney’s office in one district is binding 
upon other districts.  
The government (like the Second Circuit in the 
opinion below) agrees that there is a clear circuit split 
on the precise question posed by this Petition. Opp.13;1 
United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256, 263 n.11 
(2d. Cir. 2024) (“recogniz[ing] that circuits have been 
split on this issue for decades.”). As the Second Circuit 
noted, this conflict is well-documented and longstanding. 
Indeed, the government points out that litigants have 
sought the Court’s clarification of this issue at least 
as far back as 2011, when this Court denied certiorari 
in Prisco v. United States, 562 U.S. 1290 (2011), No. 
10-7895. 
The United States argues that the split is 3-2 in favor of 
Petitioner, not 4-2, claiming that that the “Ninth Circuit has not 
expressly addressed the matter at issue here.” Opp.13. While not 
express, the Ninth Circuit is pretty clear that it agrees with 
Petitioner’s position, holding that a U.S. Attorney can bind other 
districts and agencies, Thomas v. INS, 35 F.3d 1332 (9th Cir. 
1994), and when in doubt, “the government must bear respon-
sibility for any lack of clarity in those terms,” United States v. 
Johnston, 199 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir. 1999). 

The government seeks to minimize the split as of 
“limited importance” because “the scope of a plea or 
similar agreement is under the control of the parties 
to the agreement.” Opp.14. This turns a blind eye 
to the problem. The very premise of Petitioner’s 
argument is that the parties to the NPA did seek to 
control the scope of the relevant clauses by narrowing 
the scope of immunity for Epstein through the use of 
narrow language specifying enforceability only in the 
Southern District of Florida, and then expanding the 
scope of it as to his co-conspirators by using the broad 
term “the United States.” (App. 30-31). While doing so, 
Epstein’s lawyers were no doubt informed by how that 
language was interpreted in the jurisdiction in which 
they were practicing.  
Yet by definition, the issue presented in this case 
and every other like it only arises when the language 
in question is being interpreted in a different 
jurisdiction than the one where the agreement was 
negotiated. Accordingly, uniformity in interpretation 
of such a provision is unusually and particularly 
compelling. The very nature of a clause of this nature 
(unlike most other clauses in an agreement, which are 
not cross-jurisdictional in nature) cries out for 
nationwide symmetry. 
The government also contends, rather bizarrely, that 
“this is not itself a case that turns on any default rule.” 
Opp.14. To the contrary, it is precisely the Second 
Circuit’s default rule, adopted in United States v. 
Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1985), that doomed 
Petitioner to stand trial on a case that would have been 
dismissed outright in at least half the country. The 
primary reason this Court should grant certiorari is to 
create one single default rule across the country as to 

what parties mean when they use the term “the 
United States” without further qualification. 
II. The Second Circuit’s decision below is wrong 
and violates the principles set forth in this 
Court’s prior opinions.  
In attempting to defend the Second Circuit’s out-
come, the government advances a series of contentions 
about the Epstein NPA’s scope, the U.S. Attorney’s 
authority, contract law doctrines, and canons of con-
struction. Each lacks merit. 
As the government acknowledges, Opp.8, the start-
ing point in any contract is the text. Here, the text 
could not be more clear. In exchange for Epstein’s 
guilty plea and other penalties and concessions, 
“the United States also agrees that it will not 
institute any criminal charges against any potential 
co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited 
to [four names].” (emphasis added).  
This promise is unqualified. It is not geographically 
limited to the Southern District of Florida, it is not 
conditioned on the co-conspirators being known by the 
government at the time, it does not depend on what 
any particular government attorney may have had in 
his or her head about who might be a co-conspirator, 
and it contains no other caveat or exception. This 
should be the end of the discussion. See Santobello v. 
New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971) (“[W]hen a plea rests in 
any significant degree on a promise or agreement of 
the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the 
inducement or consideration, such promise must be 
fulfilled.”) (ignored by the government in its opposition). 
The government seeks to evade this straightforward 
language by focusing on other clauses in the NPA and 
on extrinsic context, Opp.8-10, but its efforts only 

underscore that the plain meaning favors Petitioner. 
First, the government notes (as did the Second Circuit) 
that the NPA explicitly limited Epstein’s own immunity 
to the Southern District of Florida, pointing to a clause 
stating that after Epstein fulfilled the agreement, “no 
prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of 
this Agreement… will be instituted in this District.” 
(App. 26a). The government then urges the Court to 
follow it through the looking glass, offering the 
inexplicable suggestion that the absence of a similar 
“in this District” qualifier in the co-conspirator clause 
should be ignored as immaterial. Opp.9.  
Of course, basic interpretive canons point in exactly 
the opposite direction. When parties include an 
express territorial limitation in one clause of a 
contract and omit it in another, the omission must be 
presumed intentional. Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. 
Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal 
Texts (2012). As Justice Scalia and Bryan Garner have 
explained, “a material variation in terms suggests a 
variation in meaning.” Id. at 170. Here, the drafters 
knew how to confine the promise to a single district – 
they did so for Epstein’s personal non-prosecution 
assurance. Yet when it came to Epstein’s “potential  
co-conspirators,” the drafters chose broad, unqualified 
language. In fact, not only did the parties use an 
unrestricted jurisdictional clause for the co-conspirators, 
they amended the document from a previous draft in 
which the co-conspirator immunity was limited to the 
Southern District of Florida, changing it to refer more 
broadly to the “United States.” (Pet. 3; App. 95, 108-126).  
The government’s interpretation cannot be correct 
because it would render superfluous the phrase 
“in this District” in the Epstein clause. If the “United 
States” means just the Southern District of Florida, 

why specify the district for Epstein? The only logical 
inference is that the co-conspirator promise was 
meant to reach more broadly, in line with its different 
phrasing.2 At the very least there is a textual ambi-
guity, and under Santobello and the contract inter-
pretation principle contra proferentum, such ambigu-
ity must be construed against the government as 
the drafter and promisor. See, e.g., United States v. 
Carmichael, 216 F.3d 224 (2d Cir. 2000) (“[W]e 
‘construe plea agreements strictly against the Govern-
ment.’”) (internal citation omitted); OPR report 
(“OPR”) at 80, 166 (confirming that AUSA wrote the 
specific language in question). Under any normal 
reading of this contract, then, no federal charges can 
be brought against any co-conspirator in any district 
in the United States. 
Reading the NPA “as a whole” means giving effect to 
the deliberate difference in phrasing between the 
Epstein-focused clause and the co-conspirator clause.3 
It is not, as the government contends, “extremely strange” for 
Epstein to have secured broader immunity for his co-conspirators 
than he was getting for himself, Opp.9. Defendants always try to 
get as many benefits in a plea agreement as they can – here, 
Epstein was able to obtain an additional benefit for his co-
conspirators that he was unable to secure for himself, no doubt 
because the government attorneys “wouldn’t have been interested 
in prosecuting anyone else.” OPR:70; see also OPR:80, 168. 
Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes 
the blame for what happened.” OPR:167 (internal quotation 
omitted). In addition, Epstein was concerned that if a co-conspirator 
was charged elsewhere, he might be called to testify, opening him 
up to potential charges in a different part of the country. This was 
antithetical to the global resolution Epstein sought. 
The government is right about one thing: the scope of a 
particular agreement is under the control of the parties. Opp.14. 
As the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers observes 
in its amicus brief, federal prosecutors know well how to draft 

It means recognizing that when the parties intended 
to mean “only in the Southern District of Florida,” 
they said so explicitly, and that their use of the 
all-encompassing term “the United States” in the 
co-conspirator clause was purposeful.  
The government’s invocation of “context” and the 
purported purpose of the NPA is no more persuasive. 
The government suggests that a broad grant of 
immunity cannot have been made because there 
was no consultation with the Southern District of 
New York. Opp.10. The record does not permit such a 
conclusion, as the district court denied a hearing and 
the Petitioner was not granted any discovery, so there 
is no way to confirm who was consulted. But the record 
is clear in any event that the NPA was signed on behalf 
of the United States Attorney for the Southern District 
of Florida, who was heavily involved in the negotiation 
and approval process. In addition, representatives of 
the Department of Justice were also actively involved 
in the drafting and approval process, including the 
Chief of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section 
and the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General 
for the Department’s Criminal Division. OPR:27, 28, 84. 
If these officials failed to do what their internal 
policy suggested was appropriate, it is irrelevant. The 
provision in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual advising U.S. 
Attorneys not to bind other districts was relevant in 
OPR’s review of the government attorneys’ actions 
in this case. It does not inform the outcome here, 
however, despite the government’s heavy reliance on it 
agreements to limit their scope when that is what they intend, 
and the burden is on them to be specific. When they decline to use 
simple narrowing terms, this Court should make clear that the 
broad language they use will be given its ordinary meaning. 

throughout its brief. What a prosecutor should have 
done is not relevant; whether or not the Southern 
District of Florida should have prohibited the 
Southern District of New York from prosecuting 
Ghislaine Maxwell, it clearly did so. 
Nor can the government’s appeal to context exclude 
Petitioner from the clear “including but not limited to” 
language which unmistakably signaled an intent to 
cover all “potential coconspirators,” not just those 
who were specifically named. Indeed, the broad 
“including but not limited to” clause shows the parties 
contemplated both known and unknown accomplices, 
and it was the government who drafted in the “final 
broad language,” intentionally declining to further 
enumerate individuals. OPR:70,166. The purpose 
was to assure Epstein that pleading guilty would 
protect all his associates from federal prosecution4 – 
effectively “closing” the federal case completely.5 That 
purpose is perfectly consistent with the plain text; it is 
the government’s after-the-fact spin that is inconsistent, 
The government cherry picks snippets of testimony from 
the OPR report, many of which are inconsistent with other 
statements from the same government attorneys, or which offer 
the perspective of those who admitted to unclear memories, or 
who were on vacation or otherwise disengaged at the relevant 
time. App.108, OPR: 36-37. There was a lengthy back-and-forth 
negotiating process to the inclusion of this clause, some of it 
recorded by the OPR report, some not. See OPR:36. None of this 
is relevant; the document says what it says in plain language, 
so the after-the-fact and self-serving statements of various 
participants to the process should be ignored. 
The OPR is riddled with statements reflecting that the 
government was very concerned about the strength of its case, 
that it had doubts it would result in a guilty verdict, and that 
many of the alleged victims did not want any aspect of the case to 
go to trial. See, e.g., OPR:28, 29, 36, 37, 14, 147. 

attempting to import unwritten limits that the deal-
makers did not include.  
The government’s argument, across the board, is 
essentially an appeal to what it wishes the agreement 
had said, rather than what it actually says. Of course, 
if wishful thinking were the standard, the whole NPA 
would have been thrown out long ago. The government 
has spent years lamenting that agreement, and 
initiated a massive OPR investigation into its execution 
which resulted in OPR’s conclusion that the attorneys 
who negotiated it on behalf of the government did 
many things contrary to internal government policy 
and typical practice. (App.55) (district court order 
noting OPR’s findings that the NPA was “unusual in 
many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and 
secrecy.”); see also, e.g., App. 99. 
The entire co-conspirator provision itself (putting 
aside the issue of the jurisdiction(s) in which it is 
enforceable) was, according to OPR, unusual for such 
an agreement (App. 125). But, as the amicus notes, the 
fact that the deal was unconventional does not license 
the government (or the courts) to rewrite it to conform 
to ordinary or preferred governmental practice. Amicus 
Br. 5. To the contrary, it underscores that Epstein’s 
negotiators sought, and obtained, an expansive guarantee. 
The government also suggests that Petitioner is not 
entitled to enforce the NPA because she was not a 
party to it and was not named in it. Opp.15. But as the 
court below recognized and as hornbook contract law 
dictates, Maxwell has standing to enforce the agreement 
as a third party beneficiary. App.10. Petitioner falls 
squarely within the class of persons – “any potential 
co-conspirators of Epstein” – that the NPA expressly 
protected. She is therefore an intended beneficiary 
of the agreement, and she has standing to enforce it. 

See, e.g., United States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 663 
(7th Cir. 2000) (providing that individuals who are not 
parties to a plea agreement may enforce it, like other 
third-party beneficiaries, when the original parties 
intended the contract to directly benefit them as third 
parties).  
Petitioner’s alleged status as Epstein’s co-conspirator 
was the entire basis of her prosecution. The NPA’s 
language demonstrates that the parties anticipated 
that there were additional co-conspirators beyond 
those already known. By using “including but not 
limited to” before naming some individuals, the 
government knowingly extended the benefit of the 
bargain to other unnamed individuals who partici-
pated in Epstein’s offenses. Whether the government 
attorneys personally knew the identities of every such 
person is beside the point; they certainly knew there 
could be others (hence the language). Ghislaine Maxwell’s 
name was well known to Epstein’s circle and was 
referenced in public reporting at the time of the NPA. 
But even if she had been entirely unknown, the broad 
language of the NPA evidences an intent to cover 
whoever might later be deemed a co-conspirator. 
Accordingly, Petitioner can rely on the immunity 
clause in the NPA. See, e.g., United States v. Florida 
West Int’l Airways, 853 F.Supp.2d 1209, 1228 (S.D. Fla. 
2012) (dismissing indictment against employee who 
fell within the class of employees described in plea 
agreement). 
The government’s suggestion that it would have 
drafted the agreement differently had it specifically 
had Petitioner in mind is both unprovable and 
irrelevant. If anything, the inclusion of specific names 
alongside a general category shows the parties knew 
some of the players and also wanted to cover any 

others to prevent any federal prosecution of Epstein’s 
circle. Whether or not this was wise, it was the deal, 
and Petitioner is entitled to enforce it. 
III. This case is an ideal vehicle for resolving 
the split over this important and recurring 
question. 
It is hard to imagine a more compelling scenario for 
this Court’s review: for decades now, the same federal 
promise has yielded opposite results in different 
jurisdictions, undermining the uniformity of federal 
law and the integrity of plea bargains nationwide. This 
Court’s review is warranted. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant 
the petition for certiorari.
