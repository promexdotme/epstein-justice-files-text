JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant.

COUNT ONE 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 3 of 15
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
• age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 4 of 15
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 5 of 15
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 6 of 15
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 7 of 15
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 8 of 15
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1-2     Filed 08/14/19     Page 9 of 15
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
CASE NO.:  
VE 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
NINE EAST 71ST STREET, CORPORATION, 
FINANCIAL TRUST COMPANY, INC.,  
NES, LLC,  
Defendant.  
______________________________/ 
COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, VE, by and through her undersigned counsel, for her claims against 
Defendants, alleges as follows: 
1. 
 The controversy in this cause of action exceeds the sum or value of 
$75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of different States.  
Therefore, jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. section 1332.  
2. 
Plaintiff files this Complaint under a pseudonym in order to protect her 
identity because this Complaint makes allegations of a sensitive sexual nature the 
disclosure of which, in association with her name, would cause further harm to her. 
3. 
Plaintiff is currently a resident of and domiciled in the state of Florida.   
4. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein travelled 
between and stayed regularly in multiple residences, including in New York, New 
York (within the Southern District of New York) and the United States Virgin 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 1 of 26

Islands.  
5. 
At all times material to this cause of action Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male born in 1953, who died on August 10, 2019.  
6. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation was a domestic business corporation conducting business in New York, 
with its principal place of business located at 575 Lexington Avenue, Fourth Floor,

has not been properly established although if and when it is, Plaintiff intends to 
amend to add the Estate as a party.   
11. 
Jeffrey Epstein was an officer, director, or employee of many corporate 
entities registered in various states throughout the United States, any one of which

females, including minors such as Plaintiff.   
12. 
Additionally, individuals who worked at the residences where he 
committed sexual violations, as well as others who assisted him in committing such 
violations, were employed through, or worked for, numerous other corporate entities 
whose negligence likely caused or contributed to the sexual violations that caused 
harm to Plaintiff.   
13. 
 The complete universe of those individuals and companies whose 
negligence contributed to the crimes committed by Epstein are currently unknown.  
14. 
As Plaintiff learns through discovery the identities of additional 
individual or corporate entities and the manner in which those others caused or 
contributed to causing harm to Plaintiff through negligence, Plaintiff intends to 
amend to add those parties as well.  Should discovery reveal that any of the currently 
named Defendants are not the proper identity of the Companies identified as current 
Defendants, substitution of parties shall be requested to ensure accuracy and 
correctness of pleading.

15. 
A substantial part of the acts, events, and omissions giving rise to this 
cause of action occurred in the Southern District of New York; venue is proper in 
this District.  28 U.S.C. section 1391(b)(2). 
16. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein and 
Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat her in a non-negligent manner and not 
to commit or conspire to commit intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts 
against her, including any acts that would cause Plaintiff to be harmed through 
conduct committed against her in violation of New York Penal Law section 214-G, 
New York Penal Law section 130.20; or New York Penal Law 130.66; or New York 
Penal Law 130.67; or New York Penal Law 130.52. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
17. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male over 45 years old.  Epstein was tremendously wealthy, widely recognized as a 
billionaire, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal 
sexual crimes in violation of federal and state statutes and to employ and conspire 
with other individuals and corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes 
or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
18. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his 
employees; to the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 4 of 26

direction; to the victims procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to 
advance and carry out and conceal his crimes and torts.   
19. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he 
regularly traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-
31H with tail number N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-
1159B with tail number N909JE).   
20. 
Jeffrey Epstein also travelled between and frequently inhabited and 
travelled between numerous properties and homes, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 valued conservatively 
by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00; a ranch located at 49 Zorro 
Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056 valued conservatively by Jeffrey

an Island located at Great St. James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, C); 
and an Island Little St. James Island No. 6B USVI 00802 (A, B, C).  See Jeffrey 
Epstein “Asset Summary – June 30, 2019” filed in Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB on July 
15, 2019 attached hereto as Exhibit A.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 5 of 26

21. 
Jeffrey Epstein was otherwise affiliated with the corporations that 
owned or controlled each of the real property listed in the preceding paragraph. 
22. 
The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct 
while at his townhouse in New York and concern the various corporate entities 
which provided the opportunity for his illicit conduct to occur and remain concealed 
for years.   
23. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females as young 
as 14 years old.   
24. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor 
children, and took pleasure corrupting vulnerable young females, including minor 
children, into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
25. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees 
and associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the 
purpose of harming teenage girls through sexual exploitation. 
26. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence 
that he got pleasure out of corrupting vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
27. 
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment inclusive of One Count 
of Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part due to 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 6 of 26

Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 
East 71st Street.   
28. 
On July 8, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested pursuant to the 
aforementioned Indictment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.    
29. 
The Indictment stated in part, and Plaintiff herein adopts as true, that 
“from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey 
Epstein, the defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New York (the “New York 
Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the “Palm Beach Residence”) to 
engage in sex acts with him, after which the victims were given hundreds of dollars 
in cash.”  Criminal Indictment at 1. 
30. 
“Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, 
Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly 
abused by EPSTEIN.  In this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm 
Beach.”  Criminal Indictment at 1-2.   
31. 
“The victims described herein were as young as 14 years old at the time 
they were abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation.  Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 7 of 26

many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18, including because, in some 
instances, minor victims expressly told him their age.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.  
32. 
“In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple 
states to sexually abuse and exploit, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, … worked and conspired 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, 
among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with 
EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence.”  Criminal 
Indictment at 2.   
33. 
The indictment further explained, and Plaintiff adopts and alleges, that, 
“[v]ictims were initially recruited to provide ‘massages’ to Epstein, which would be 
performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.   
34. 
“Between at least in or about 2002 and in or about 2005, Epstein abused 
numerous minor victims at the New York Residence by causing these victims to be 
recruited to engage in paid sex acts with him.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.     
35. 
Defendants enabled Jeffrey Epstein to receive near daily massages from 
young females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than 
receive regular body massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing the young 
females in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 8 of 26

36. 
Additionally, employees of the various Defendant corporations 
performed actions or inactions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in 
danger of being sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his 
sexually abusive acts.   
37. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females.  The nature of 
the Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking venture and enterprise enabled victims 
themselves to elevate their status to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an 
elevation only made possible through the negligence of Defendants.   
38. 
Recruiters were taught by employees of Defendants to inform targeted 
victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, resources, and 
influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance their 
careers and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body massages 
in order to avail receive his assistance and influence.   
39. 
The collaboration from Defendants and the many employees fulfilled 
Epstein’s compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, 
psychological, financial, and related vulnerabilities. Defendants’ tactics included 
promising the victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission 
into educational institutions, educational tuition, protection, and other things of 
value in exchange for sex and concealment of Jeffrey Epstein’s actions.    
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 9 of 26

40. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females, 
dated back to at least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased 
substantially with the necessary assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ 
employees.   
41. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, 
and with help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, 
recruited or procured dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, 
for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual gratification.  
42. 
Jeffrey Epstein, and consequently Defendants, specifically targeted 
underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or economically disadvantaged young 
females to sexually molest and abuse.   
43. 
Additionally, Defendants through employees, informed young females 
that Jeffrey Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and could either advance or 
destroy the career or education of any young female brought to provide Jeffrey 
Epstein a massage, depending on her degree of cooperation.   
VE 
44. 
Minor victim VE was subjected to the types of illegal sexual acts 
detailed in the Criminal Indictment filed against Jeffrey Epstein by the Southern 
District of New York.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 10 of 26

45. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed abhorrent acts of sexual abuse against 
Plaintiff in 2001 when she was only sixteen years old. 
46. 
In or about 2001, Plaintiff was recruited by another minor child to go 
to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, New York to provide him with a 
“massage.”  
47. 
The minor child who recruited Plaintiff (“Plaintiff’s friend”) informed 
Plaintiff that she would be paid $300 to provide a massage to a man in Manhattan.  
48. 
Plaintiff was a minor female with no experience or training in massage.  
49. 
She was recruited under the false pretense that she would be providing 
a legitimate body massage at the mansion owned or controlled by Defendant, Nine 
East.  
50. 
In or about the Fall of 2001, Plaintiff’s friend brought Plaintiff to 
Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide him with a massage.  
51. 
Upon arrival to the mansion, the two minor children were escorted 
inside by an employee of Defendant NES, LLC and taken to Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room.   
52. 
Plaintiff’s friend entered the massage room and left Plaintiff outside the 
door.   
53. 
Moments later, Plaintiff’s friend exited the room and instructed 
Plaintiff to enter the room alone.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 11 of 26

54. 
Plaintiff walked into the dark room which contained a massage table, 
various massage oils, and numerous photographs of nude girls.  
55. 
Unsure of what to expect, Plaintiff waited for the man to arrive for his 
massage.   
56. 
Jeffrey Epstein entered the room and immediately removed his clothing 
before positioning himself on the massage table. 
57. 
Jeffrey Epstein then provided Plaintiff with instruction on how to 
massage his body.   
58. 
Jeffrey Epstein quickly turned the massage into a sexual encounter with 
the then sixteen-year-old Plaintiff.  
59. 
During the sexual encounter, Plaintiff told Jeffrey Epstein that she did 
not feel comfortable.  Jeffrey Epstein ignored her and continued to engage in the 
improper and illegal sexual contact until he was finished.    
60. 
The sexual encounter ended when Jeffrey Epstein masturbated to 
climax. 
61. 
Plaintiff was paid $300 cash before being escorted out of his mansion, 
all with assistance from Defendants; this payment was made to induce Plaintiff to 
conceal the activities of Epstein and to entice her to return.   
62. 
Plaintiff observed the opulence of the mansion owned by Defendant, 
Nine East, and the organization of Defendant, NES, Inc., which collectively 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 12 of 26

facilitated her further cooperation with Jeffrey Epstein, culminating in New York 
Penal Law Section 130 crimes being committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein. 
63. 
Within days, Plaintiff returned to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion wherein 
she endured yet another sexual assault, this time more severe.   
64. 
Plaintiff was taken by elevator to the floor where Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room was located.   
65. 
Similar to the first time, Jeffrey Epstein appeared wearing only a towel 
and laid face down on the massage table.  Within minutes, he again turned the 
massage into a sexual encounter against the 16-year-old plaintiff.  He instructed her 
to take her clothes off this time.   
66. 
During the second encounter, in addition to harmful, forcible, physical 
touching and sexual exploitation of Plaintiff, Jeffrey Epstein forcibly used a sex toy 
on Plaintiff, forcibly pressing it onto and in Plaintiff’s vagina.   
67. 
Jeffrey Epstein then commanded Plaintiff to straddle him.  Knowing 
that she had no way out of the Mansion, she complied with Jeffrey Epstein’s orders.   
68. 
Jeffrey Epstein moved plaintiff’s panties aside and attempted to insert 
his penis into her vagina, briefly penetrating her, while Plaintiff was resisting.   
69. 
During this encounter, Epstein digitally penetrated Plaintiff. The 
encounter ended with Jeffrey Epstein masturbating to climax.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 13 of 26

70. 
Throughout the duration of the sexual encounter, Plaintiff found herself 
trapped in Jeffrey Epstein’s large mansion under the impression that there was no 
feasible or safe means of escape. 
71. 
All sexual acts were performed by Jeffrey Epstein intentionally and for 
no legitimate purpose and for his own gratification when Plaintiff was a minor child 
less than seventeen years of age.  
72. 
The intentional acts of Jeffrey Epstein against Plaintiff constitute a 
sexual offense as defined in New York Penal Law § 130.  
73. 
Pursuant to New York Penal Law § 130.05, a person is deemed 
incapable of consent when she is less than seventeen years old.   
74. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed sexual misconduct against Plaintiff as 
defined in §130.20 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein 
engaged in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff without Plaintiff’s consent.   
75. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed a forcible touching against Plaintiff as 
defined in §130.52 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein, 
intentionally and for no legitimate purpose, engaged the forcible sexual touching of 
Plaintiff for the purpose of degrading or abusing her or for the purpose of gratifying 
his sexual desire.  
76. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed an aggravated sexual abuse in the third 
degree against her as defined in §130.66 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 14 of 26

Jeffrey Epstein inserted a foreign object into the vagina of Plaintiff by forcible 
compulsion.     
77. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed an aggravated sexual abuse in the second 
degree against her as defined in §130.67 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as 
Jeffrey Epstein caused physical injury to Plaintiff when he inserted a finger into the 
vagina of Plaintiff by forcible compulsion.    
COUNT I 
NEGLIGENT SECURITY AGAINST  
NINE EAST 71st STREET, CORPORATION 
78. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 77 above. 
79. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation (hereinafter “Nine East”), was the lawful owner of the property located 
at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, 10021. 
80. 
Defendant, Nine East, acquired title to the property on September 6, 
1989 and retained such title until the property was transferred to Maple, Inc. on 
December 11, 2011.  
81. 
At all such times, Defendant Nine East maintained legal control over 
the subject premises.  
82. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a regular habitant of Defendant Nine East and in 
fact resided at the premises when he was present in New York.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 15 of 26

83. 
Defendant knew or should have known when Defendant was in the 
home owned by Defendant Nine East when Epstein had young females, including 
minor females such as Plaintiff.   
84. 
When Plaintiff was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein in 2001, 
Defendant, Nine East, as the owner of the property where all of the sexual abuse 
occurred, had a non-delegable duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe 
condition.  
85. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty additionally included the duty to take 
precautions to protect guests, visitors, or invitees from foreseeable harm, including 
foreseeable criminal conduct.  
86. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty further included the duty to take 
reasonable precautionary measures to minimize the risk of criminal acts upon 
visitors.  
87. 
Most important, Defendant had a duty to take protective measures when 
it could be shown that the company possessing, owning, or controlling the property, 
knew or had reason to know from past experience that there was a likelihood of 
conduct that would endanger a visitor.   
88. 
To establish foreseeability, the criminal conduct at issue must be 
reasonably predictable based on the prior occurrence of the same or similar criminal 
activity at a location sufficiently proximate to the subject location. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 16 of 26

89. 
No conduct becomes more foreseeable or predictable than the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein, in which he engaged regularly, if not daily, when he was 
in Defendant’s property.  
90. 
Nearly every day that Jeffery Epstein was on or in the property of 
Defendant Nine East, he was engaging in criminal sexual behavior in violation of 
New York Penal Code Section 130.  
91. 
Defendant knew or should have known of Jeffrey Epstein’s propensity 
for sexually abusing minor children, including regularly on the premises.  
92. 
Defendant knew of should have known from past experience that there 
was a high likelihood that Jeffrey Epstein would engage in foreseeable criminal 
conduct that was likely to seriously endanger or injure a visitor, including Plaintiff.  
93. 
Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff by failing to take even minimal 
safety precautions to protect against the predictable criminal acts of Jeffrey Epstein, 
which were reasonably predictable and foreseeable to occur on the property.  
94. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
95. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, the Plaintiff has 
in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 17 of 26

loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT II 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST 
FINANCIAL TRUST COMPANY, INCORPORATED 
96. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 77 above. 
97. 
At all times material hereto, Financial Trust Company, Inc. (hereinafter 
“Financial Trust”) was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in 
New York.   
98. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Financial Trust, employed 
Jeffrey Epstein.  
99. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, had a duty to exercise reasonable care to 
refrain from retaining in its employ a person with known dangerous propensities in 
a position that would present a foreseeable risk of harm to others.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 18 of 26

100. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to satisfy the personal needs 
of Jeffrey Epstein, which included daily massages which Epstein requires to be 
sexual in nature.   
101. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s requirement that he receive regular massages from 
untrained young females caused Defendant and its employees to knowingly turn a 
blind eye to the dangerous sexual addictive propensities of Jeffrey Epstein, despite 
knowledge that he would cause harm to many young females including Plaintiff, in 
order to retain its most valuable employee—Jeffrey Epstein.  
102. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to further Jeffrey Epstein’s 
goal to obtain, recruit, and procure young females for the purposes of providing 
sexually explicit massages to Jeffrey Epstein.  
103. 
During the course and scope of his employment for Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein did fulfill the corporate objective of receiving sexual massages procured for 
him by employees of Defendant.  
104. 
Jeffrey Epstein was notorious for converting each massage into a 
sexually exploitive activity in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130, a fact 
which was known or should have been known in the exercise of reasonable care by 
Defendant.  
105. 
Even though Defendant, Financial Trust, knew of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
propensity for the sort of behavior that caused Plaintiff’s harm and Jeffrey Epstein’s 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 19 of 26

constant engagement in this type of criminal behavior during the course and scope 
of his employment, Defendant retained Jeffrey Epstein and failed to properly 
supervise him.  
106. 
Jeffrey Epstein did not have a set work schedule or office but instead 
conducted business on behalf of the corporation from various locations all over the 
world.   
107. 
While conducting said business, Jeffrey Epstein was frequently using 
corporate finances in furtherance of his sexually explicit behavior.   
108. 
Upon information and belief, at times other employees of the Defendant 
corporation were coordinating these sexually explicit massages for Epstein to engage 
in during business hours, while he was within the course and scope of his 
employment for Defendant.  
109. 
In fact, while Jeffrey Epstein was conducting business telephone calls 
or authorizing company actions on behalf of Defendant, Financial Trust, he would 
frequently be receiving a sexually explicit massage.   
110. 
In certain circumstances, sexually explicit massages provided by young 
women, oftentimes minor children, who were untrained in the art of massage, were 
coordinated by another employee of Defendant who knew or should have known 
that the massage was being conducted by an underage girl for the exclusive purpose 
of committing sexual crimes against her.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 20 of 26

111. 
Jeffrey Epstein engaged in this type of sexually abusive behavior on a 
daily basis to the extent that engaging in sexual massages became the most regular 
activity that he engaged in while in the course and scope of his employment.  
112. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual routine of recruiting and engaging in sexually 
explicit massages began many years before the formation of Defendant and was not 
a lifestyle unknown to Defendant, Financial Trust.  
113. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care 
should have known that Jeffrey Epstein was potentially dangerous, had engaged in 
a pattern of criminal sexual behavior against young females, including minors, for 
years prior to the formation of Defendant Financial Trust, and that he was not going 
to cease committing criminal sexual acts.   
114. 
Jeffrey Epstein was retained with knowledge of the propensity of this 
sort of behavior.   
115. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, retained Jeffrey Epstein with knowledge 
that he would in fact injure others, such as Plaintiff, during the course and scope of 
his employment.  
116. 
Despite such knowledge, Financial Trust knowingly placed Jeffrey 
Epstein in a position to cause foreseeable harm, which could have been prevented 
had Defendant taken reasonable care in making decisions regarding the retention and 
supervision of Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 21 of 26

117. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
118. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT III 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST NES, LLC 
119. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 77 above. 
120. 
It is believed that each employee of Defendant, NES, operated at the 
direction of Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 22 of 26

121. 
Upon information and belief, the primary responsibility of each 
employee of Defendant, NES, LLC (“NES”) was to fulfill the needs or requests of 
Jeffrey Epstein; more particularly, his daily massage schedule.  
122. 
Upon information and belief, the employees of Defendant, NES, were 
compensated to primarily, if not exclusively, procure or maintain each young female 
masseuse, or to assist, knowingly or unknowingly, in the concealment of any 
misconduct committed against each masseuse.  
123. 
Upon information and belief, the employment responsibilities of the 
various employees of Defendant, NES, included but were not limited to: 1) recruiting 
young females, including minor children such as Plaintiff, to provide massages, 2) 
creating Jeffrey Epstein’s massage schedule, 3) maintaining Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage schedule, 4) escorting various young females into the massage room at the 
New York mansion owned by Defendant Nine East, 5) maintaining contact with the 
various young females who were recruited to the New York mansion for the 
purposes of providing Jeffrey Epstein with a massage, 6) providing compensation to 
each young masseuse upon the completion of her engagement with Jeffrey Epstein, 
7) providing meals and food and other services to the young females in order to 
provide an air of legitimacy to the functions of the corporation, 8) providing 
hospitality services to the young females in order to provide an air of legitimacy to 
the functions of the corporation, 9) providing educational services, 10) providing 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 23 of 26

medical services, 11) providing transportation services, 12) providing housing 
services, 13) providing various other enticements to ensure the continued 
cooperation of the various young female masseuse with Defendant NES’s corporate 
objective, 14) encouraging individuals, including the females who were recruited to 
the house to provide a massage to recruit other young females to engage in the same 
activity for Jeffrey Epstein, and 15) coordinating together and with Jeffrey Epstein 
to convey a powerful and legitimate enterprise system capable of gaining 
cooperation from young females recruited for massage, often minors such as 
Plaintiff.  
124. 
In fulfilling their employment responsibilities, each employee 
voluntarily assumed a duty with respect to each young female recruited to massage 
Jeffrey Epstein, including Plaintiff.  
125. 
To fulfill said duty, each employee was required to perform their 
assumed duty carefully without omitting to do what an ordinarily prudent person 
would do in accomplishing the task.  
126. 
The young females being recruited to engage in massages for Jeffrey 
Epstein were inexperienced in the art of massage, a fact that was known or should 
have been known to Defendant NES and its employees in the exercise of reasonable 
care.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 24 of 26

127. 
Plaintiff relied on Defendant NES’s voluntary assumption of a duty as 
well as the voluntary assumption of each individual employee to act with reasonable 
care towards her.   
128. 
In the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant and its employees further 
knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of Jeffrey Epstein and the 
proximate harm that would be caused by his likely sexual misconduct and various 
violations of New York Penal Law Section 130.  
129. 
The failure of Defendant NES and each of its respective employees to 
act in the same manner as an ordinarily prudent person, placed Plaintiff in a more 
vulnerable position than if Defendant and its employees had not assumed the 
obligation to treat her with reasonable care.   
130. 
In breaching its Duty, NES launched a force or instrument of harm 
directed toward Plaintiff.  In doing so, Defendant, NES, enhanced the risk Plaintiff 
faced and caused her to forego any opportunity she may otherwise have had to avoid 
the risk inherent with being in a room alone with Jeffrey Epstein to perform a 
massage as an untrained minor child.  
131. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
132. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 25 of 26

emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against NES, Inc, for 
compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive damages and such 
other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  Plaintiff hereby demands 
trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

- v. -
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
X 
X 
COUNT ONE 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 3 of 15
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
• age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 4 of 15
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 5 of 15
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 6 of 15
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 7 of 15
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 8 of 15
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3-2     Filed 08/20/19     Page 9 of 15
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 1 of 30

2. 
Plaintiff files this Complaint under a pseudonym in order to protect her 
identity because this Complaint makes allegations of a sensitive sexual nature the 
disclosure of which, in association with her name, would cause further harm to her. 
3. 
Plaintiff is currently a resident of and domiciled in the state of Florida.   
4. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein travelled 
between and stayed regularly in multiple residences, including in New York, New 
York (within the Southern District of New York) and the United States Virgin 
Islands.  He was a citizen of the United States and a resident of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.  
5. 
At all times material to this cause of action Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male born in 1953, who died on August 10, 2019.  
6. 
Defendant, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein”) 
the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein was opened and domiciled in the United States Virgin 
Islands, St. Thomas Division, and is the legal entity responsible for intentional, 
criminal, or tortious conduct committed by Jeffrey Epstein as described in this 
Complaint.   
7. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation was a domestic business corporation conducting business in New York, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 2 of 30

with its principal place of business located at 575 Lexington Avenue, Fourth Floor, 
New York, NY 10022.   
8. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Financial Trust Company, Inc. 
was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in New York.   
9. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant NES, LLC, was and is a 
domestic limited liability company registered in and conducting business in New 
York.   
10. 
Corporate Defendants NES, LLC; Financial Trust Company, Inc; Nine 
East 71st Street, referred to as “Defendants,” each performed substantial business in 
New York. 
11. 
Plaintiff intends to amend this complaint to add or substitute additional 
parties as discovery reveals the identities of other negligent corporate or individual 
actors.   
12. 
Jeffrey Epstein was an officer, director, or employee of many corporate 
entities registered in various states throughout the United States, any one of which 
may also bear legal responsibility for the crimes he committed against young 
females, including minors such as Plaintiff.   
13. 
Additionally, individuals who worked at the residences where he 
committed sexual violations, as well as others who assisted him in committing such 
violations, were employed through, or worked for, numerous other corporate entities 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 3 of 30

whose negligence likely caused or contributed to the sexual violations that caused 
harm to Plaintiff.   
14. 
 The complete universe of those individuals and companies whose 
negligence contributed to the crimes committed by Epstein are currently unknown.  
15. 
As Plaintiff learns through discovery the identities of additional 
individual or corporate entities and the manner in which those others caused or 
contributed to causing harm to Plaintiff through negligence, Plaintiff intends to 
amend to add those parties as well.  Should discovery reveal that any of the currently 
named Defendants are not the proper identity of the Companies identified as current 
Defendants, substitution of parties shall be requested to ensure accuracy and 
correctness of pleading.  
16. 
A substantial part of the acts, events, and omissions giving rise to this 
cause of action occurred in the Southern District of New York; venue is proper in 
this District.  28 U.S.C. section 1391(b)(2). 
17.

represented now through Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (and referred to herein as “Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein”) and Corporate Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat 
her in a non-negligent manner and not to commit, or conspire to commit, or cause to 
be committed intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts against Plaintiff, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 4 of 30

including any acts that would cause Plaintiff to be harmed through conduct 
committed against her in violation of New York Penal Law section 214-G, New 
York Penal Law section 130.20; or New York Penal Law 130.35; or New York Penal 
Law 130.52; or New York Penal Law 130.66; or New York Penal Law 130.67. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
18. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male over 45 years old.  Epstein was tremendously wealthy, widely recognized as a 
billionaire, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal 
sexual crimes in violation of federal and state statutes and to employ and conspire 
with other individuals and corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes 
or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
19. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his 
employees; to the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his 
direction; to the victims procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to 
advance and carry out and conceal his crimes and torts.   
20. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he 
regularly traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 5 of 30

31H with tail number N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-
1159B with tail number N909JE).   
21. 
Jeffrey Epstein also travelled between and frequently inhabited and 
travelled between numerous properties and homes, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 valued conservatively 
by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00; a ranch located at 49 Zorro 
Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056 valued conservatively by Jeffrey 
Epstein’s own admission at $17,246,208.00; a home located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida 33480 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own 
admission at $12,380,209.00; an apartment located at 22 Avenue Foch, Paris, France 
75116 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at $8,672,820.00; 
an Island located at Great St. James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, C); 
and an Island Little St. James Island No. 6B USVI 00802 (A, B, C).  See Jeffrey 
Epstein “Asset Summary – June 30, 2019” filed in Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB on July 
15, 2019 attached hereto as Exhibit A.  
22. 
Jeffrey Epstein was otherwise affiliated with the corporations that 
owned or controlled each of the real property listed in the preceding paragraph. 
23. 
The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct 
while at his townhouse in New York and concern the various corporate entities 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 6 of 30

which provided the opportunity for his illicit conduct to occur and remain concealed 
for years.   
24. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females as young 
as 14 years old.   
25. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor 
children, and took pleasure corrupting vulnerable young females, including minor 
children, into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
26. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees 
and associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the 
purpose of harming teenage girls through sexual exploitation. 
27. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence 
that he got pleasure out of corrupting vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
28. 
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment inclusive of One Count 
of Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part due to 
Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 
East 71st Street.   
29. 
On July 8, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested pursuant to the 
aforementioned Indictment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.    
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 7 of 30

30. 
The Indictment stated in part, and Plaintiff herein adopts as true, that 
“from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey 
Epstein, the defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New York (the “New York 
Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the “Palm Beach Residence”) to 
engage in sex acts with him, after which the victims were given hundreds of dollars 
in cash.”  Criminal Indictment at 1. 
31. 
“Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, 
Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly 
abused by EPSTEIN.  In this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm 
Beach.”  Criminal Indictment at 1-2.   
32. 
“The victims described herein were as young as 14 years old at the time 
they were abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation.  Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that 
many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18, including because, in some 
instances, minor victims expressly told him their age.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.  
33. 
“In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple 
states to sexually abuse and exploit, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, … worked and conspired 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 8 of 30

among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with 
EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence.”  Criminal 
Indictment at 2.   
34. 
The indictment further explained, and Plaintiff adopts and alleges, that, 
“[v]ictims were initially recruited to provide ‘massages’ to Epstein, which would be 
performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.   
35. 
“Between at least in or about 2002 and in or about 2005, Epstein abused 
numerous minor victims at the New York Residence by causing these victims to be 
recruited to engage in paid sex acts with him.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.     
36. 
Defendants enabled Jeffrey Epstein to receive near daily massages from 
young females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than 
receive regular body massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing the young 
females in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130. 
37. 
Additionally, employees of the various Defendant corporations 
performed actions or inactions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in 
danger of being sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his 
sexually abusive acts.   
38. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females.  The nature of 
the Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking venture and enterprise enabled victims 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 9 of 30

themselves to elevate their status to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an 
elevation only made possible through the negligence of Defendants.   
39. 
Recruiters were taught by employees of Defendants to inform targeted 
victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, resources, and 
influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance their 
careers and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body massages 
in order to avail receive his assistance and influence.   
40. 
The collaboration from Defendants and the many employees fulfilled 
Epstein’s compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, 
psychological, financial, and related vulnerabilities. Defendants’ tactics included 
promising the victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission 
into educational institutions, educational tuition, protection, and other things of 
value in exchange for sex and concealment of Jeffrey Epstein’s actions.    
41. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females, 
dated back to at least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased 
substantially with the necessary assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ 
employees.   
42. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, 
and with help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 10 of 30

recruited or procured dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, 
for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual gratification.  
43. 
Jeffrey Epstein, and consequently Defendants, specifically targeted 
underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or economically disadvantaged young 
females to sexually molest and abuse.   
44. 
Additionally, Defendants through employees, informed young females 
that Jeffrey Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and could either advance or 
destroy the career or education of any young female brought to provide Jeffrey 
Epstein a massage, depending on her degree of cooperation.   
VE 
45. 
Minor victim VE was subjected to the types of illegal sexual acts 
detailed in the Criminal Indictment filed against Jeffrey Epstein by the Southern 
District of New York.  
46. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed abhorrent acts of sexual abuse against 
Plaintiff in 2001 when she was only sixteen years old. 
47. 
In or about 2001, Plaintiff was recruited by another minor child to go 
to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, New York to provide him with a 
“massage.”  
48. 
The minor child who recruited Plaintiff (“Plaintiff’s friend”) informed 
Plaintiff that she would be paid $300 to provide a massage to a man in Manhattan.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 11 of 30
---

49. 
Plaintiff was a minor female with no experience or training in massage.  
50. 
She was recruited under the false pretense that she would be providing 
a legitimate body massage at the mansion owned or controlled by Defendant, Nine 
East.  
51. 
In or about the Fall of 2001, Plaintiff’s friend brought Plaintiff to 
Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide him with a massage.  
52. 
Upon arrival to the mansion, the two minor children were escorted 
inside by an employee of Defendant NES, LLC and taken to Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room.   
53. 
Plaintiff’s friend entered the massage room and left Plaintiff outside the 
door.   
54. 
Moments later, Plaintiff’s friend exited the room and instructed 
Plaintiff to enter the room alone.   
55. 
Plaintiff walked into the dark room which contained a massage table, 
various massage oils, and numerous photographs of nude girls.  
56. 
Unsure of what to expect, Plaintiff waited for the man to arrive for his 
massage.   
57. 
Jeffrey Epstein entered the room and immediately removed his clothing 
before positioning himself on the massage table. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 12 of 30

58. 
Jeffrey Epstein then provided Plaintiff with instruction on how to 
massage his body.   
59. 
Jeffrey Epstein quickly turned the massage into a sexual encounter with 
the then sixteen-year-old Plaintiff.  
60. 
During the sexual encounter, Plaintiff told Jeffrey Epstein that she did 
not feel comfortable.  Jeffrey Epstein ignored her and continued to engage in the 
improper and illegal sexual contact until he was finished.    
61. 
The sexual encounter ended when Jeffrey Epstein masturbated to 
climax. 
62. 
Plaintiff was paid $300 cash before being escorted out of his mansion, 
all with assistance from Defendants; this payment was made to induce Plaintiff to 
conceal the activities of Epstein and to entice her to return.   
63. 
Plaintiff observed the opulence of the mansion owned by Defendant, 
Nine East, and the organization of Defendant, NES, Inc., which collectively 
facilitated her further cooperation with Jeffrey Epstein, culminating in New York 
Penal Law Section 130 crimes being committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein. 
64. 
Within days, Plaintiff returned to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion wherein 
she endured yet another sexual assault, this time more severe.   
65. 
Plaintiff was taken by elevator to the floor where Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room was located.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 13 of 30

66. 
Similar to the first time, Jeffrey Epstein appeared wearing only a towel 
and laid face down on the massage table.  Within minutes, he again turned the 
massage into a sexual encounter against the 16-year-old plaintiff.  He instructed her 
to take her clothes off this time.   
67. 
During the second encounter, in addition to harmful, forcible, physical 
touching and sexual exploitation of Plaintiff, Jeffrey Epstein forcibly used a sex toy 
on Plaintiff, forcibly pressing it onto and in Plaintiff’s vagina.   
68. 
Jeffrey Epstein then commanded Plaintiff to straddle him.  Knowing 
that she had no way out of the Mansion, she complied with Jeffrey Epstein’s orders.   
69. 
Jeffrey Epstein moved plaintiff’s panties aside and attempted to insert 
his penis into her vagina, briefly penetrating her, while Plaintiff was resisting.   
70. 
During this encounter, Epstein digitally penetrated Plaintiff. The 
encounter ended with Jeffrey Epstein masturbating to climax.   
71. 
Throughout the duration of the sexual encounter, Plaintiff found herself 
trapped in Jeffrey Epstein’s large mansion under the impression that there was no 
feasible or safe means of escape. 
72. 
All sexual acts were performed by Jeffrey Epstein intentionally and for 
no legitimate purpose and for his own gratification when Plaintiff was a minor child 
less than seventeen years of age.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 14 of 30

73. 
The intentional acts of Jeffrey Epstein against Plaintiff constitute a 
sexual offense as defined in New York Penal Law § 130.  
74. 
Pursuant to New York Penal Law § 130.05, a person is deemed 
incapable of consent when she is less than seventeen years old.   
75. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed sexual misconduct against Plaintiff as 
defined in §130.20 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein 
engaged in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff without Plaintiff’s consent.   
76. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed rape in the first degree as defined in §130.35 
inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff by forcible 
compulsion; 
77. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed a forcible touching against Plaintiff as 
defined in §130.52 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein, 
intentionally and for no legitimate purpose, engaged the forcible sexual touching of 
Plaintiff for the purpose of degrading or abusing her or for the purpose of gratifying 
his sexual desire.  
78.

degree against her as defined in §130.66 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as 
Jeffrey Epstein inserted a foreign object into the vagina of Plaintiff by forcible 
compulsion.

COUNT III 
NEGLIGENT SECURITY AGAINST  
NINE EAST 71st STREET, CORPORATION 
86. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 above. 
87. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation (hereinafter “Nine East”), was the lawful owner of the property located 
at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, 10021. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 18 of 30

88. 
Defendant, Nine East, acquired title to the property on September 6, 
1989 and retained such title until the property was transferred to Maple, Inc. on 
December 11, 2011.  
89. 
At all such times, Defendant Nine East maintained legal control over 
the subject premises.  
90. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a regular habitant of Defendant Nine East and in 
fact resided at the premises when he was present in New York.  
91. 
Defendant knew or should have known when Defendant was in the 
home owned by Defendant Nine East when Epstein had young females, including 
minor females such as Plaintiff.   
92. 
When Plaintiff was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein in 2001, 
Defendant, Nine East, as the owner of the property where all of the sexual abuse 
occurred, had a non-delegable duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe 
condition.  
93. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty additionally included the duty to take 
precautions to protect guests, visitors, or invitees from foreseeable harm, including 
foreseeable criminal conduct.  
94. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty further included the duty to take 
reasonable precautionary measures to minimize the risk of criminal acts upon 
visitors.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 19 of 30

95. 
Most important, Defendant had a duty to take protective measures when 
it could be shown that the company possessing, owning, or controlling the property, 
knew or had reason to know from past experience that there was a likelihood of 
conduct that would endanger a visitor.   
96. 
To establish foreseeability, the criminal conduct at issue must be 
reasonably predictable based on the prior occurrence of the same or similar criminal 
activity at a location sufficiently proximate to the subject location. 
97. 
No conduct becomes more foreseeable or predictable than the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein, in which he engaged regularly, if not daily, when he was 
in Defendant’s property.  
98. 
Nearly every day that Jeffery Epstein was on or in the property of 
Defendant Nine East, he was engaging in criminal sexual behavior in violation of 
New York Penal Code Section 130.  
99. 
Defendant knew or should have known of Jeffrey Epstein’s propensity 
for sexually abusing minor children, including regularly on the premises.  
100. 
Defendant knew of should have known from past experience that there 
was a high likelihood that Jeffrey Epstein would engage in foreseeable criminal 
conduct that was likely to seriously endanger or injure a visitor, including Plaintiff.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 20 of 30

101. 
Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff by failing to take even minimal 
safety precautions to protect against the predictable criminal acts of Jeffrey Epstein, 
which were reasonably predictable and foreseeable to occur on the property.  
102. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
103. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, the Plaintiff has 
in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT IV 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST 
FINANCIAL TRUST COMPANY, INCORPORATED 
104. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 above. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 21 of 30

105. 
At all times material hereto, Financial Trust Company, Inc. (hereinafter 
“Financial Trust”) was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in 
New York.   
106. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Financial Trust, employed 
Jeffrey Epstein.  
107. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, had a duty to exercise reasonable care to 
refrain from retaining in its employ a person with known dangerous propensities in 
a position that would present a foreseeable risk of harm to others.   
108. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to satisfy the personal needs 
of Jeffrey Epstein, which included daily massages which Epstein requires to be 
sexual in nature.   
109. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s requirement that he receive regular massages from 
untrained young females caused Defendant and its employees to knowingly turn a 
blind eye to the dangerous sexual addictive propensities of Jeffrey Epstein, despite 
knowledge that he would cause harm to many young females including Plaintiff, in 
order to retain its most valuable employee—Jeffrey Epstein.  
110. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to further Jeffrey Epstein’s 
goal to obtain, recruit, and procure young females for the purposes of providing 
sexually explicit massages to Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 22 of 30

111. 
During the course and scope of his employment for Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein did fulfill the corporate objective of receiving sexual massages procured for 
him by employees of Defendant.  
112. 
Jeffrey Epstein was notorious for converting each massage into a 
sexually exploitive activity in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130, a fact 
which was known or should have been known in the exercise of reasonable care by 
Defendant.  
113. 
Even though Defendant, Financial Trust, knew of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
propensity for the sort of behavior that caused Plaintiff’s harm and Jeffrey Epstein’s 
constant engagement in this type of criminal behavior during the course and scope 
of his employment, Defendant retained Jeffrey Epstein and failed to properly 
supervise him.  
114. 
Jeffrey Epstein did not have a set work schedule or office but instead 
conducted business on behalf of the corporation from various locations all over the 
world.   
115. 
While conducting said business, Jeffrey Epstein was frequently using 
corporate finances in furtherance of his sexually explicit behavior.   
116. 
Upon information and belief, at times other employees of the Defendant 
corporation were coordinating these sexually explicit massages for Epstein to engage 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 23 of 30

in during business hours, while he was within the course and scope of his 
employment for Defendant.  
117. 
In fact, while Jeffrey Epstein was conducting business telephone calls 
or authorizing company actions on behalf of Defendant, Financial Trust, he would 
frequently be receiving a sexually explicit massage.   
118. 
In certain circumstances, sexually explicit massages provided by young 
women, oftentimes minor children, who were untrained in the art of massage, were 
coordinated by another employee of Defendant who knew or should have known 
that the massage was being conducted by an underage girl for the exclusive purpose 
of committing sexual crimes against her.  
119. 
Jeffrey Epstein engaged in this type of sexually abusive behavior on a 
daily basis to the extent that engaging in sexual massages became the most regular 
activity that he engaged in while in the course and scope of his employment.  
120. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual routine of recruiting and engaging in sexually 
explicit massages began many years before the formation of Defendant and was not 
a lifestyle unknown to Defendant, Financial Trust.  
121. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care 
should have known that Jeffrey Epstein was potentially dangerous, had engaged in 
a pattern of criminal sexual behavior against young females, including minors, for 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 24 of 30

years prior to the formation of Defendant Financial Trust, and that he was not going 
to cease committing criminal sexual acts.   
122. 
Jeffrey Epstein was retained with knowledge of the propensity of this 
sort of behavior.   
123. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, retained Jeffrey Epstein with knowledge 
that he would in fact injure others, such as Plaintiff, during the course and scope of 
his employment.  
124. 
Despite such knowledge, Financial Trust knowingly placed Jeffrey 
Epstein in a position to cause foreseeable harm, which could have been prevented 
had Defendant taken reasonable care in making decisions regarding the retention and 
supervision of Jeffrey Epstein.  
125. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
126. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 25 of 30

and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT V 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST NES, LLC 
127. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 above. 
128. 
It is believed that each employee of Defendant, NES, operated at the 
direction of Jeffrey Epstein.  
129. 
Upon information and belief, the primary responsibility of each 
employee of Defendant, NES, LLC (“NES”) was to fulfill the needs or requests of 
Jeffrey Epstein; more particularly, his daily massage schedule.  
130. 
Upon information and belief, the employees of Defendant, NES, were 
compensated to primarily, if not exclusively, procure or maintain each young female 
masseuse, or to assist, knowingly or unknowingly, in the concealment of any 
misconduct committed against each masseuse.  
131. 
Upon information and belief, the employment responsibilities of the 
various employees of Defendant, NES, included but were not limited to: 1) recruiting 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 26 of 30

young females, including minor children such as Plaintiff, to provide massages, 2) 
creating Jeffrey Epstein’s massage schedule, 3) maintaining Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage schedule, 4) escorting various young females into the massage room at the 
New York mansion owned by Defendant Nine East, 5) maintaining contact with the 
various young females who were recruited to the New York mansion for the 
purposes of providing Jeffrey Epstein with a massage, 6) providing compensation to 
each young masseuse upon the completion of her engagement with Jeffrey Epstein, 
7) providing meals and food and other services to the young females in order to 
provide an air of legitimacy to the functions of the corporation, 8) providing 
hospitality services to the young females in order to provide an air of legitimacy to 
the functions of the corporation, 9) providing educational services, 10) providing 
medical services, 11) providing transportation services, 12) providing housing 
services, 13) providing various other enticements to ensure the continued 
cooperation of the various young female masseuse with Defendant NES’s corporate 
objective, 14) encouraging individuals, including the females who were recruited to 
the house to provide a massage to recruit other young females to engage in the same 
activity for Jeffrey Epstein, and 15) coordinating together and with Jeffrey Epstein 
to convey a powerful and legitimate enterprise system capable of gaining 
cooperation from young females recruited for massage, often minors such as 
Plaintiff.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 27 of 30

132. 
In fulfilling their employment responsibilities, each employee 
voluntarily assumed a duty with respect to each young female recruited to massage 
Jeffrey Epstein, including Plaintiff.  
133. 
To fulfill said duty, each employee was required to perform their 
assumed duty carefully without omitting to do what an ordinarily prudent person 
would do in accomplishing the task.  
134. 
The young females being recruited to engage in massages for Jeffrey 
Epstein were inexperienced in the art of massage, a fact that was known or should 
have been known to Defendant NES and its employees in the exercise of reasonable 
care.  
135. 
Plaintiff relied on Defendant NES’s voluntary assumption of a duty as 
well as the voluntary assumption of each individual employee to act with reasonable 
care towards her.   
136. 
In the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant and its employees further 
knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of Jeffrey Epstein and the 
proximate harm that would be caused by his likely sexual misconduct and various 
violations of New York Penal Law Section 130.  
137. 
The failure of Defendant NES and each of its respective employees to 
act in the same manner as an ordinarily prudent person, placed Plaintiff in a more 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 28 of 30

vulnerable position than if Defendant and its employees had not assumed the 
obligation to treat her with reasonable care.   
138. 
In breaching its Duty, NES launched a force or instrument of harm 
directed toward Plaintiff.  In doing so, Defendant, NES, enhanced the risk Plaintiff 
faced and caused her to forego any opportunity she may otherwise have had to avoid 
the risk inherent with being in a room alone with Jeffrey Epstein to perform a 
massage as an untrained minor child.  
139. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
140. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against NES, Inc, for 
compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive damages and such 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 3     Filed 08/20/19     Page 29 of 30

other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  Plaintiff hereby demands 
trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

Plaintiff, 
vs. 
DARREN K. INDYKE AND  
RICHARD D. KAHN AS JOINT  
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE  
TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 1 of 7

ARGUMENT 
I. 
PLAINTIFF IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN 
THIS CIRCUIT.  
This action involves Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault of Plaintiff (“Plaintiff”) 
in violation of the New York Law and/or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 through 1595.  Plaintiff submits this Memorandum of Law 
in support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Proceed Anonymously.  Allowing 
Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will protect her highly sensitive personal 
information that will remain the focus of this litigation. There is no prejudice to 
Defendants in allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously, nor is there any significant 
public interest in the disclosure of the Plaintiff’s identity.  In fact, the public interest 
in this case weighs in favor of granting Plaintiff’s request to proceed anonymously 
for her protection.  
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) requires a Complaint to “include the 
names of all the parties.”  However, the court has discretion to allow a plaintiff to 
proceed anonymously.  Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 190 (2d. 
Cir. 2008).  “[C]ourts have granted anonymity to protect against disclosure of a wide 
range of issues involving matters of the utmost intimacy, including sexual assault.” 
Doe. No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 196 (EDNY 2006); see also 1991 McKinney’s 
Sessions Laws of N.Y. at 2211-2212 (“sexual assault victims have unfortunately had 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 2 of 7

to endure a terrible invasion of their physical privacy. They have a right to expect 
that this violation will not be compounded by a further invasion of their privacy”).  
“When determining whether a plaintiff may be allowed to maintain an action 
under a pseudonym, the plaintiff’s interest in anonymity must be balanced against 
both the public interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant.”  Id. at 189.  
The balancing of interests entails the consideration of ten non-exhaustive factors, 
though the court has discretion to consider “other factors relevant to the particular 
case under consideration.” Id. at 189-190. The ten factors are: 
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and 
of a personal nature; (2) whether identification poses a risk of 
retaliatory physical or mental harm to the party seeking to proceed 
anonymously or even more critically, to innocent non-parties; (3) 
whether identification presents other harms and the likely severity of 
those harms, including whether the injury litigated against would be 
incurred as a result of the disclosure of the plaintiff’s identity; (4) 
whether the plaintiff is particularly vulnerable to the possible harms of 
disclosure, particularly in light of [her] age; (5) whether the suit is 
challenging the actions of the government or that of private parties; (6) 
whether the defendant is prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to press 
[her] claims anonymously, whether the nature of that prejudice (if any) 
differs at any particular stage of the litigation, and whether any 
prejudice can be mitigated by the district court; (7) whether the 
plaintiff’s identity has thus far been kept confidential; (8) whether the 
public’s interest in the litigation is furthered by requiring the plaintiff 
to disclose his identity; (9) whether, because of the purely legal nature 
of the issues presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public 
interest in knowing the litigants’ identities; and (10) whether there are 
any  alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the 
plaintiff. 
Id. at 190 (internal citations and quotations omitted). 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 3 of 7

II. 
ALL TEN ANONYMITY FACTORS WEIGH IN FAVOR OF 
PERMITTING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY.  
In this case, all delineated Sealed Plaintiff factors support Plaintiff’s 
application for anonymity, which should be granted for her protection.  Plaintiff is a 
victim of multiple instances sexual assault as a minor child.  The heinous acts that 
were committed against Plaintiff are highly sensitive in nature and are particularly 
difficult for her to address in a public forum. 
For those reasons, among many others, identification of Plaintiff in this matter 
may pose a risk of retaliation. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  In order to 
warrant anonymity, the possible retaliatory harm may be either physical or 
psychological in nature. See Doe v. Del Rio, 241 F.R.D. 154, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) 
Epstein’s vast wealth and far reaching connections make it clear that retaliation 
could be employed against individuals pursuing claims against the Estate of Jeffrey 
Epstein.  In addition to exposing Plaintiff to physical or psychological harm, 
retaliation could also silence potential witnesses from coming forward.  
The public exposure of Plaintiff’s identity would certainly cause her to suffer 
additional or exacerbated emotional or psychological harm including shame, 
embarrassment, depression, anxiety, and the array of side effects that go along 
therewith.  Should Plaintiff’s real identity be revealed, her safety could also be at 
risk as she is the world and the press who are currently laser focused on Jeffrey 
Epstein and his sexually exploitative escapades.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 4 of 7

Despite the fact that Defendants are private parties and not Government 
entities, Defendants are not “ordinary” private parties because of Epstein’s known 
wealth, power, and reputation. See Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195 (2006).  Jeffrey Epstein 
has been a known sexual predator with substantial financial influence for many 
years.  For years before his death, Epstein had been investigated by various state 
prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for his sexual assaults on 
young girls.  
Given Epstein’s notoriety, Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and the 
widespread concealment of the same “raise concerns affecting a larger association 
rather than the interest of an individual plaintiff.” See id. at 195. In this case, the 
“larger association” is society in general. Society has an interest in eradicating the 
predatory practices of powerful men against vulnerable, susceptible women—
including the practice of luring young girls for sexual purposes.  This case is 
therefore more “analogous to one involving a government defendant, where personal 
anonymity is more readily granted because of the existence of a public interest in the 
action.” EW v. New York Blood Center, 213 F.R.D. 108, 112 (EDNY 2003). 
“The public right to scrutinize governmental functioning is not so completely 
impaired by a grant of anonymity to a party as it is by closure of the trial itself . . . 
Party anonymity does not obstruct the public’s view of the issues joined or the 
court’s performance in resolving them.”  See Doe v. Stegall¸ 653 F.2d 180, 185 (5th 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 5 of 7

Cir. 1981).  The public’s interest in this legal question is not furthered by requiring 
Plaintiff to disclose her identity. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190 (citing Del 
Rio, 241 F.R.D. at 154 (“whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the 
litigants’ identities”)); see also Free Speech v. Reno, Case No. 98 Civ. 2680 MBM, 
1999 WL 47310 at *3 (SDNY Feb. 1, 1999) (“because the particular plaintiffs in this 
constitutional challenge are essentially interchangeable with similarly situated 
persons, there appears little public interest in which particular persons have actually 
sued…”).  Because Plaintiff’s anonymity would not impair the public’s right to view 
or scrutinize this lawsuit, this factor weighs in favor of nondisclosure.  Moreover, 
“the public generally has a strong interest in protecting the identities of sexual assault 
victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”  
Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195.  
Finally, [t]he Second Circuit directed district courts to evaluate “whether there 
are any alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff.” 
Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190 (citing Roe v. Aware Woman Center for Choice, 
Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 687 (11th Cir. 2001)): 
The only justification the defendants offer for stripping Roe of her 
privacy is the argument that they will not be able to adequately conduct 
discovery without knowing her true identity. However, that argument 
is eviscerated by Roe’s offer to disclose her name to the defendants for 
discovery purposes on condition that they do not disclose it to the 
general public. That is a reasonable way to reconcile the competing 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 6 of 7

interests, and the district court can enter an appropriate protective order. 
The district court should have granted Roe’s motion to proceed 
anonymously.   
Here, Plaintiff will cooperate with the court and the Defendants and reveal 
Plaintiff’s true identity to defendants for discovery purposes on the condition that 
Defendants do not disclose Plaintiff’s name to the general public. 
III. CONCLUSION 
The balancing factors articulated by the Second Circuit weigh in favor of 
protecting Plaintiff’s identity by allowing her to proceed anonymously.  For the 
foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion for 
Leave to Proceed Anonymously.

KATLYN DOE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against-
DARREN K. INDYKE, et al.., 
Defendant. 
-----------------------------------------------------------x 
CASTEL, U.S.D.J. 
19-cv-7771 (PKC) 
ORDER 
Plaintiff seeks leave to proceed in this action without disclosing her identity using 
instead a pseudonym. She alleges that Jeffrey Epstein, with the assistance of associates and 
entities, engaged in "manipulate[ion]," "c011trol," "sexual exploitation," "sexual assault[]," 
"sexual abuse," and "forced ... intercourse" of or with plaintiff; she was seventeen when the 
course of conduct began. (Complaint ,r,r 58-68.) At this juncture, no defendant has been served. 
Rule I0(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., provides that "[t]he title of [a] complaint must name 
all the parties." The Second Circuit has recognized that the use of a pseudonym is, however, 
appropriate in limited circumstances where the reasons for anonymity outweigh the public's right 
of access to judicial proceedings and any prejudice to a defendant. Sealed Plaintiffv. Sealed 
Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). The Circuit's opinion in Sealed Plaintiff lays out 
ten non-exhaustive factors to be considered in determining whether to allow a case to proceed on 
an anonymous basis. Id. at 190. The Court analyzes the Complaint in light of these factors. 
- 1 -

Case 1:19-cv-07771-PKC   Document 28   Filed 09/12/19   Page 2 of 5
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 10/16/19     Page 2 of 5
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are 
highly sensitive and of a 
personal nature. 
The Complaint alleges an on-going pattern of sexual assault and abuse beginning 
when plaintiff was seventeen years-old and asserts that she has and is continuing to suffer 
psychological injury as a result. (Complaint 1152-65.) These are highly sensitive allegations of 
a personal nature. 
(2) whether identification of the plaintiff poses a risk of 
physical or mental retaliation to the plaintiff or to a 
third paity. 
No risk of retaliation is alleged. Jeffrey Epstein is dead and there is no credible 
evidence of a risk of retaliation from others. There is an allegation of threats of retaliation in the 
past if she did not comply with demands for sex acts that she would suffer financial, 
psychological, and reputational harm (Id. 1 84) but no facts me alleged that those threats are 
likely to continue after the death of Epstein. 
(3) whether identification of plaintiff poses the risk of other 
harms, their likely severity and whether they ai·e of the type 
that the litigation seeks to redress. 
The nature of the allegations make it logical to conclude at this emly stage that 
disclosure of plaintiffs identity would cause further psychological hmm to plaintiff which is the 
precise hann the litigation seeks, in pai-t, to redress.

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 10/16/19     Page 3 of 5
( 4) whether there are other factors that make the 
plaintiff paiticularly vulnerable to hmm of 
disclosure, for exainple, because of her age. 
By the Comt's calculation, the plaintiff is 29 or 30. She is described in the 
complaint as having physical conditions that make her paiticularly vulnerable. (Id. ,i,r 54-55.) 
She alleges that she has incmTed and will continue to incur "medical and psychological 
expenses" as a result of the conduct alleged. (Id. ,i 132.) 
(5) whether the action challenges the actions of government or 
government actors, or merely private parties. 
The actions alleged are not the actions of a government actor or instrumentality 
but rather those of private paities. 
( 6) the nature of any prejudice to a defendant from 
allowing the plaintiff to proceed anonymously and 
whether any prejudice can be mitigated by the court. 
The Complaint alleges that the representatives of the estate of Epstein have 
liability for his actions. It also alleges that various non-natural persons are liable for acts and 
omissions causing plaintiff harm. In such circumstances it is critical that the accused defendants 
know the identity of the plaintiff in order to investigate and defend against the claim. The Court 
can mitigate the prejudice to defendants by requiring the disclosure of the actual name of the 
plaintiff in a document to be served on defendants and also filed under seal with the Comt. 
Plaintiff does not object to disclosure "for discovery purposes on the condition that Defendants 
do not disclose Plaintiff's name to the general public." (P. Mem. 6; Doc 3-1.)

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 10/16/19     Page 4 of 5
(7) whether the plaintiff's identity has thns far been 
kept confidential. 
Insofar as the Comi is aware, the identity of the plaintiff is not widely known. 
(8) whether there is a legitimate public interest or 
benefit in requiring the plaintiff 
to disclose her identity. 
There is public interest in the litigation because of the notoriety of Epstein and 
those with whom he associated, but disclosure of the identity of the plaintiff is not likely to be of 
a legitimate importance or benefit to the public. 
(9) Whether the issues in the action are predominately 
or purely legal nature suggesting that the public 
interest in the plaintiffs identity may be weak. 
The issues in the case are not purely or predominately of a legal nature. This case 
turns principally on its facts. 
(I 0) whether there are any alternative mechanisms for 
protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff. 
It is the disclosure of her identity that would exacerbate any preexisting harm to 
plaintiff and hence there is not alternative mechanism for protecting her confidentiality. 
CONCLUSION 
Factors 1 and 3 tilt strongly in favor of permitting plaintiff to proceed 
anonymously and are supported by factors 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Factors 2, 5, 9 are either neutral or 
- 4 -

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 10/16/19     Page 5 of 5
weakly support denying the motion. The Court concludes that, at this juncture, the public right to 
know is substantially outweighed by the plaintiffs legitimate need for anonymity and that 
prejudice to a defendant can be mitigated by orders of the Court. The Court reserves the right to 
modify this Order as the case progresses. 
Plaintiffs motion (Doc 3) is GRANTED. Within seven days of the appearance of 
a defendant, plaintiff shall disclose her identity to the appearing defendant in a document to be 
submitted to the Court for sealing. No defendant may disclose the identity of plaintiff to any 
person other than counsel without further order of this Comi. 
SO ORDERED.

Re: 
VE v. Nine East 71st Street, et al., 1:19-cv-07625 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We represent Plaintiff VE in the above-captioned action.  On November 12, 2019, counsel for 
Defendants authored a letter to the Court requesting a two-week extension to answer, move or otherwise 
respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint, from November 15, 2019 to November 29, 2019.  [DE 27].   
Plaintiff filed her complaint in this matter on August 20, 2019.  On September 10, 2019, counsel 
for Defendants agreed to accept service of Plaintiff’s complaint on behalf of all Defendants thereby 
making Defendants’ respective responsive pleadings due on October 1, 2019—twenty-one days later.  
At the request of Defendants, Plaintiff granted all Defendants an extension of time to respond to 
Plaintiff’s complaint through and including November 15, 2019, pending court approval of said 
agreement.  All parties also agreed to adjourn to a mutually agreeable date after November 15 any court 
conferences scheduled to occur before then pending approval.  
Counsel for Defendants now seek an additional “two week extension of Defendants’ time to 
answer, move or otherwise respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint from November 15, 2019 to November 29, 
2019” while representing that “[t]his is the first request for an extension of this deadline.”  While it may 
be semantically true that this is the first request for an extension of this deadline that Defendants have 
made to this Court, it is certainly not the first request for extension nor the first extension as Plaintiff has 
already graciously provided Defendants with a forty-five (45) day extension to respond to her complaint.  
Furthermore, in framing Plaintiff’s position on such request for further extension, Defendants 
represented to the Court that Plaintiff “cannot agree to postpone the conference” indicating that 
Defendants are not seeking an adjournment of the Initial Pretrial Conference.  However, the conference 
that Plaintiff does not agree to postpone is the Rule 26(f) Conference that per the Federal Rules of Civil 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 28     Filed 11/12/19     Page 1 of 2

Procedure and the local rules of this Court must occur by November 15, 2019—twenty-one days prior 
to the Initial Pretrial Conference which is set to occur on December 6, 2019.  To date, Plaintiff has asked 
counsel for Defendants to provide dates and times to conduct the Rule 26(f) Conference on more than 
one occasion to no avail.  At this time, Plaintiff requests that the Court Order Defendants to comply with 
their Rule 26(f) obligations and engage in the conference by the November 15, 2019 deadline.   
Pertinently, in seeking the additional fourteen (14) day extension, counsel for Defendants 
represented to Plaintiff that the need for further extension arises from Defendants’ intent to file a pleading 
in a Court in the United States Virgin Islands relating to the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, which will 
provide information on a “claims resolution program.”  Plaintiff does not believe that the use of any 
alternative dispute resolution mechanism should stay or modify the course of litigation in this matter.  
Plaintiff intends to issue discovery and begin taking depositions as soon as permitted by the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules of this Court given the voluminous discovery that 
is anticipated to occur in this case as it pertains to all Defendants.  There is no reason to provide 
Defendants with an additional fourteen (14) day extension as they have already been provided with an 
additional forty-five (45) days to respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  Furthermore, absent relief from the 
Court, Defendants are obligated to participate in the Rule 26(f) conference in this matter by Friday, 
November 15, 2019.  Being that the basis for Defendants’ currently requested extension relates to 
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court deny

Dear Judge Nathan:

sanders 
We represent Darren K. lndyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (incorrectly named herein as "Joint Personal Representatives" of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein), Nine East 71 st Street, Corporation, Financial Trust Company, Inc., and 
NES, LLC (together, "Defendants") in the referenced action. We write to respectfully request a 
two week extension of Defendants' time to answer, move or otherwise respond to Plaintiff's 
Complaint, from November 15, 2019 to November 29, 2019. The Initial Pretrial Conferen'ee i 
scriecluled for December S, 2019. The requested extension would not affect any other 
scheduled dates in this action. 
This is the first request for an extension of this deadline. The Court previously So 
Ordered the parties' agreement whereby we accepted service of Plaintiff's Complaint and 
setting the November 15 response deadline (ECF #21 ). 
Plaintiff's counsel does not consent to this request, stating: "I cannot agree to extend 
your time to respond any further and cannot agree to postpone the conference." However, as 
explained above, this is the first request to extend the November 15 deadline; and we do not 
request an adjournment of the Initial Pretrial Conference. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

MOTION FOR LEAVETO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 30     Filed 11/15/19     Page 1 of 4

Defendants Darren K.Indyke and Richard D.Kahn,Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey
E.Epstein (incorrectlynamed herein as “Joint Personal Representatives”of the Estate of Jeffrey
E.Epstein),Nine East 71st Street,Corporation,Financial Trust Company,Inc.,and NES,LLC
(together,“Defendants”),bytheir attorneys,submit this memorandum of law in response to
Plaintiff’s Motion For Leave To Proceed Anonymously(the Motion)(ECF #4):
ARGUMENT
Defendants do not object to Plaintiff proceeding under a pseudonym to prevent the
disclosure of her identityto the general public.However,this response is necessaryfor two
separate reasons.
First,Plaintiff’s Motion asserts numerous unproven statements,couched as facts already
in evidence,as well as conclusions of law.Defendants object to these unproven and conclusory
assertions.In anyevent,the Court does not need to consider suchassertions to resolve Plaintiff’s
Motion.
Second,it is imperative that Plaintiff’s desire to shield her identityfrom the general
public not come at the expense of Defendants’fundamental right to fullyand fairlyrespond to
Plaintiff’s allegations in her Complaint.Therefore,Defendants respectfullyrequest that the
Court resolve Plaintiff’s Motion byentering the proposed order annexed hereto as Exhibit A (the
“Proposed Order”).The Proposed Order would protect Plaintiff’s identityfrom public disclosure
while enabling Defendants to fullyrespond to the Complaint withminimal prejudice. The
Proposed Order would also permit the parties to seekto modifyit as necessaryto meet the needs
of this case as it evolves.1
The Proposed Order accords withwell-established Second Circuit law because it
1Should this matter proceed to discovery,the Parties would be able to address discovery issues implicated by
Plaintiff’s desire to proceed anonymously in a separate discovery order that otherwise addresses general
confidentialityconcerns.
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 30     Filed 11/15/19     Page 2 of 4

balances Plaintiff’s legitimate desire to maintain confidentialitywithDefendants’right to fully
defend themselves in this action.See Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant,537F3d 185,189(2d
Cir.2008)(“W e agree that the interests of boththe public and the opposing partyshould be
considered when determining whether to grant an application to proceed under a pseudonym.”);
Doe v. Skyline Automobiles Inc.,375F Supp 3d 401,407(S.D.N.Y.2019)(“Allowing Plaintiff
[alleging sexual assault,harassment,and discrimination]to proceed anonymouslywould
disadvantage Defendants at all stages of litigation,including settlement,discovery,and trial.
Plaintiff's anonymitywould make it more difficult to obtain witnesses and witness testimony,
Defendants would have less leverage in settlement negotiations,and Defendants would not be
able to fullyand adequatelycross-examine the Plaintiff.”);Doe I v. Four Bros. Pizza, Inc.,13-
CV-1505VB,2013W L6083414,at *31(S.D.N.Y.Nov.19,2013)(“Significantly,it will not be
feasible for the parties to proceed withdiscoveryin a meaningful waywhile plaintiffs remain
anonymous.”).
The Proposed Order is also consistent withPlaintiff’s positions in her Motion.The
Motion provides that Plaintiff’s counsel “will cooperate withthe court and the Defendants and
reveal Plaintiff’s true identityto defendants for discoverypurposes on the condition that
Defendants do not disclose Plaintiff’s name to the general public.” (ECF #4-1at p.7).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing,Defendants respectfullyrequest that the Court enter the Proposed
Order and grant Defendants suchother and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

THE COURT:  Good morning.  
MALE SPEAKER:  Good morning.
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Good morning, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ordinarily we’d start by calling the
case but we have a number of cases here and rather than do
this in a tedious way, we’ve asked everyone to sign in on an
appearance sheet.  And I just want to make sure I know who
everyone is.  So first, on plaintiff’s side in these various
cases, these are cases, just for the record, these are cases
that are brought by various plaintiffs against for shorthand
the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein.  
Can I know who Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson
are?
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Brad Edwards.
MS. HENDERSON:  Brittany Henderson.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Arick Fudali?
MR. FUDALI:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Arick
Fudali.
THE COURT:  Good morning.  Roberta Kaplan?
MS. KAPLAN:  Good morning, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  And Kate Donneger [Ph.]?
MS. DONNEGER:  Good morning, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.  David Brody, Laura Star,
Alan Goldfarb and Andrew Posen [Ph.].
MR. BRODY:  Good morning, Your Honor.  David Brody.

MS. STAR:  Laura Star.
MR. POSEN:  Andrew Posen [Ph.].
MR. GOLDFARB:  Alan Goldfarb.
THE COURT:  Got it.  Then I have David Boies, Sigrid
McCawley, Josh Schiller.
MR. BOIES:  Good morning, Your Honor.  David Boies.
MR. SCHILLER:  Josh Schiller.  Good morning.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sigrid McCawley.   
THE COURT:  Got it.  Marion Wang and David Mullkoff.
MS. WANG:  Mariann Wang.  Daniel Mullkoff will join
me later.  
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. WANG:  Good morning.
THE COURT:  Good morning.  And on defendant’s side,
well, you have a fewer number of people so why don’t you just
introduce yourselves?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Bennet
Moskowitz; Troutman Sanders, here with my colleague Charles
Glover, and we represent the co-executors of the Estate of
Jeffrey E. Epstein as well as with certain exceptions various
other defendants in the actions for which we’re here today. 
To explain that a little further --
THE COURT:  That’s all right. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That’s fine. 
THE COURT:  For the time being, that’s fine.
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 4 of 52

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  All right.  So the first thing I want to
do is just explain what my role is in these cases and perhaps
what my role isn’t in these cases.  First of all, I don’t know
how much you all know about the inner workings of the court
but when a civil case comes into this court it is assigned to
a district judge and it is designated to a magistrate judge. 
Or a magistrate judge is designated on the case.  Having a
magistrate judge such as myself designated on a case does not
mean that I do anything on the case.  It usually doesn’t even
mean I know that the case is in front of me at all.  And
certainly, it doesn’t give me authority to act.  The authority
to act comes from an order of reference by the district judge
on that case.  There is a difference between a designation and
a reference.  When a district judge refers a case to a
magistrate judge, the docket for that case will have an entry
that says order of reference.  The order of reference will
specify what it’s for.  In these cases, a number of the
district judges have referred the cases to me for what’s
called general pretrial supervision.  General pretrial
supervision includes supervising the discovery process,
certain motions that are not dispositive motions, seeing if I
can assist with settlement, scheduling matters.  It does not
include dispositive motions, making reports and
recommendations on dispositive motions unless the order of
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 5 of 52

reference says that.  And an order of reference can be
anything as narrow as can you work on one very particular
thing or can you assist with settlement?  To as broad as on
the parties’ consent it’s before you for all purposes.  
The decision was made, as I understand it, that as
an institutional matter all these cases were not going to be
placed before a single district judge.  But it was also
decided that they would be designated to a single magistrate
judge so that if the district judges wanted to refer for, for
example, discovery supervision or to aid in settlement, that
would be before a single magistrate judge, and I am that lucky
magistrate judge.  But not all of the cases that we’ve seen
come into the court have been referred to me at this time.  So
you have to look at the dockets in your cases, and new ones as
they come in because I’m sure some new ones will come in, and
see if there is actually an order of reference.  Now, you may
see a different magistrate judge designated and it may have
slipped through the cracks.  A lot of these are just -- they
come out of the wheel and it’s random.  There’s one I know
that’s still showing a designation to Judge Fox.  I think it
will be re-designated to me.  If you’re noticing that and
you’re not noticing a re-designation to me, you can just give
our chambers a call and bring it to our attention and we can
look into that.
But even if they are all designated to me, which I
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 6 of 52

think is the plan, again, they may or may not all be referred
to me.  Right now there are orders of reference in, for
general pretrial supervision, in one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, and I believe there will be nine because
Judge Gardephe just signed one, nine of the cases out of 14. 
Judge Buchwald has one case that is 19-CV-10474.  I do not
believe she is going to refer.  I think she prefers to
supervise the case herself.  And there are a couple where I
just don’t know yet.  And of course I think there’s one that
may not even be assigned to a district judge yet.  And again,
they’re still coming in.  So just be aware of that because
there’s a good chance that I’m going to be supervising your
case for discovery and for non-dispositive disputes for
scheduling, for seeing if I can assist with settlement.  But
there is also a chance that I will not be.  All right?  And in
particular right now I know that Judge Buchwald does not wish
me to supervise hers.
In addition, Judge Schofield has two cases right
now.  They are 19-CV-10475 and 19-CV-10577.  I believe she
scheduled her own conference a little farther down the road. 
I think she still wants to go forward with that but I
anticipate that at some point either before then or after then
she is likely to refer to me as well, but she wants to get a
handle on it herself.  
So district judges are individuals.  They handle
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 7 of 52

things in individual ways sometimes.  And just be aware
dispositive motions will go in front of them unless they are
specifically referred to me.  And if any order of reference is
narrow, you have to look at it, see what it says, and
understand that’s the particular reason it’s before me.  All
right?  
So with that said, I nonetheless wanted to give
notice to anyone who’s on these cases that I was having this
conference so that you could be informed, so that you could be
present if you have an interest, and you could hear what’s
said.  So that’s number one.
Number two, I have seen in the press and in some of
the correspondence that was put in front of the Court in one
of the cases that there’s some talk about the estate working
toward coming up with a settlement idea, concept, a plan for
trying to create a fund or do something.  I’ve also seen some
murmurings, I don’t know if they’re true or not, that not all
of the plaintiffs’ attorneys might be fully on board with the
process that’s being set up which may not have been involving
them.  
So I’d like to understand what is going on on that
front.  And if it is possible to have these cases put on a
settlement track, I’d like to make sure that everyone’s on
board with the process of developing a plan for that and to
get a feel for what it’s going to entail, potential time line
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 8 of 52

issues that are involved so that we can first see before we
get into discovery issues other kinds of squabbles, see if in
fact settlement is possible and we can move toward that.
So let me start on defendant’s side since rumor has
it, and see what you have to say on that.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Would you
like me to stand or --
THE COURT:  It’s okay.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I’m happy to.  I’m glad you raised
this because one of the things I wanted to bring to Your
Honor’s attention is that having assumed, although I don’t
like assumptions, that you may have seen in the press that
there is some kind of a claims program, I wanted to actually
take the opportunity today to explain to you briefly what is
going on.  And since you asked specifically, I’ll start there. 
So there is what I feel confident in calling an
extraordinary opportunity that has already started that can
lead to an alternative to all this litigation.  A lot of
people here as you can see.  And this would be an
extraordinary opportunity also to conserve party and judicial
resources.  And what happened is almost a week ago exactly the
co-executors, and this is probably some of the stories you
have seen, filed through counsel, not us, through estate
counsel in US Virgin Islands where the will is being probated,
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 9 of 52

an application for expedited approval of a claims
administration process.  So if I can just briefly explain what
that action means and what was actually filed because with
respect to everyone in the room, I don’t know that every story
was as accurate as each other.  So the filing was for approval
to have the process go forward.  I fully expect it will be
approved.  I’m not the Court, obviously.  But I have every
reason to believe it will be promptly approved.  What it is
not is actually the nuts and bolts of how the program will
work.  What it does is it says the executors have selected
very esteemed people, Kenneth Feinberg who many view, I
believe rightfully so, is the nation’s leading claims
administration expert.  Jordana Feldman, who is also a leading
expert.  She actually just very recently left her position as
deputy special master of the September 11th victim compensation
fund.  And she has demonstrated through that profound empathy
for victims, deep commitment to fairness of process, fairness
of outcome.  And also Camille Viras [Ph.] who has worked with
Mr. Feinberg over many years and is also a leading expert.  I
selected those three people to design, and then Ms. Feldman to
administer the program.  However, what’s happening now is now
that the filing has been made, and this is all in the filing
and for any details I don’t have I would encourage anyone who
has questions on the plaintiff’s side to reach out to the
program administrators and designers for whom I don’t speak
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 10 of 52

because they’re fully independent.  But what the application
laid out is basically the overview of what the program is and
is not leaving open what will be the protocol for the design
of how the program works on a finer basis to be designed now
with input invited from every plaintiff’s attorney sitting
here today, their clients, and anyone else who’s out there
that is contemplating bringing a claim against the estate
related to, you know, these general sexual abuse allegations. 
So everyone is invited to provide input.  
Ms. Feldman will have complete autonomy.  She has
completed autonomy as to decision-making authority over the
program operations and to claim determinations.  The estate
has no authority, will have no authority to modify or reject
Ms. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim.  The
claimants will retain their rights unless and until they
actually accept a determination.  So in other words, this
again, all through the filing and what’s been reported in the
press, everyone in this room, their clients can, it’s
voluntary, but again, extraordinary opportunity, they can
through the entire process of the claims program, find out if
they’re eligible to receive a claim determination, receive a
claim determination, and then decide do they want to accept it
or not.  Unless they accept it and sign a release, all their
legal rights in terms of these lawsuits are preserved.  So I
will say right now, and it’s probably not necessarily a
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 11 of 52

discussion for today, but it’s directly relevant to what
you’ve asked me about, we of course on the co-executors side
are more than willing to work with plaintiffs to stay actions,
toll claims, whatever they need to preserve their claims so
they have no prejudice if they also then go forward to see if
the claims process can resolve their claim in a much more, you
know, general I shall say, more efficient than most civil
litigation works in this country, and confidentially which I
should point out means that it’s a confidential process and
the estate itself is bound by certain confidentiality.  But
the claimants are more than free absent, you know, certain
things and we worked on the protocol, to go out and tell their
stories if they still want to.  So that’s what I mean when I
say confidential.  I know there have been a lot of concerns
about people wanting to proceed anonymously so that the claims
process is great for that concern too.
There is no cap as I understand it on the claims
determinations meaning whatever the claims administrators
decide in their expert judgment should be awarded to someone
there’s not going to be an arbitrating limit in any way on
what that is.  Again, encourage anyone with specific questions
in that regard to weigh in on the protocol and to ask the
administrators themselves.  And I would just like to say that,
you know, because of this extraordinary opportunity, I think
it would be a bad outcome for the Court, a bad outcome for all
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 12 of 52

the parties in here on both sides for these cases to move full
steam ahead while this opportunity is now live.  I mean the
approval says the timing will be prompt.  The claims
administrators expect that within 90 days or so of the Court’s
approval of the filing they’ll start receiving claims.  This
is not going to be a long drawn out thing.  And I see no
benefit to in the meantime having people, you know, clutter
these dockets with things that could probably, we hope, and I
expect and hope, will ultimately be avoided forever.
THE COURT:  All right.  One thing I forgot to say up
front is you don’t see a court reporter sitting here.  We do
have electronic recording equipment which means that if all
goes well there should be a recording of this conference.  And
so if anyone wants to have a transcript made, that’s possible. 
And this is an on-the-record conference.  If you’re not
familiar with how to go about obtaining a transcript, I think
most people are, but if you’re not, you can order it through
the court’s website.  The website was just redesigned so the
instructions I used to give people about this are now a little
different.  But I believe that up at the top of the website
you’ll see a few horizontal lines that suggest maybe there’s a
drop down menu there.  And if you click on it, you should find
something about courtroom technology.  And if you follow
through and scroll down on that page you should find something
about what’s called electronic court reportings or ECR which
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 13 of 52

will tell you how to go about ordering a transcript.  
Because we do not have a court reporter and because
any record will be through somebody typing up what they are
hearing on a recording, I’m going to ask anyone who speaks to
introduce yourself each time before you speak so that there’s
no confusion as to who’s speaking.  That was Mr. Moskowitz
speaking, correct?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Correct, Your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Correct.  Okay.  So if anyone else wants
to speak on this subject, just please identify who you are
again because there are a lot of you on plaintiff’s side. 
Anyone on plaintiff’s side want to say something on the
subject?
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, Roberta Kaplan.  I’m
counsel for the pseudonymous plaintiff in the case pending
before Judge Failla.  
You heard I think a number of times Mr. Moskowitz
use the word extraordinary.  And on that word and perhaps that
word only I’m in full agreement with Mr. Moskowitz.  I have
been -- I and many of my counsel here have been litigating in
this courthouse for combined decades and we are approached the
other side as a group many weeks ago to try to talk about,
negotiate, and be involved in a settlement process that would
be set up to administer claims for 14, 15, 16-year-old
children who were criminally abused, sexually abused by Mr.
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 14 of 52

Epstein.  There was radio silence, complete radio silence on
their end for week after week despite repeated entreaties from
myself and others for us to have involvement in who was
selected and who would be in charge of this.  These are women
who want agency over their lives, number one?  Two, what the
procedure would be.  And three, Your Honor, perhaps most
importantly, how much money would be set aside?  We have
basically no information about what’s in the estate, what
assets are in the estate, what assets are not in the estate,
who is the beneficiary of the estate.  We are told it’s Mr.
Epstein’s brother but we have no due diligence on that.  And
we said to the other side that before this process was created
we thought we were entitled to some due diligence about what
assets are being put on the table to settle claims and what
assets are going to go to Mr. Epstein’s brother.  We’ve had
zero disclosure about that.  We’ve had zero discussions about
who the person would be and how to set it up.  I’m always,
Your Honor, and I think I speak for everyone here, we are
always willing to keep an open mind about settlement.  But
given the way that this has been created, the secret
unilateral way that this has been created that frankly was
incredibly disrespectful to these women who have already
suffered criminal horrible abuse, we have serious doubts.  And
the idea that we would stay any of these matters in favor of
the process that he described I think would be irrational for
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 15 of 52

many of us.  I don’t know if Your Honor has any questions but
at least in my case I think that’s our reaction.
THE COURT:  I’ll hear from anyone else who wants to
be heard on this topic. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Sure.  Your Honor, Brad Edwards.  I’m
here on behalf of VE, Catlin [Ph.] Doe, Priscilla Doe, and
Lisa Doe for plaintiffs proceeding under pseudonyms.
I agree with most of what Ms. Kaplan said.  I will
say that it seems to me that this slow developing vague
settlement concept, once it gets set up it might be okay or it
might be good for some people.  It doesn’t make any sense at
all that is an all or nothing thing meaning we have said we’re
willing to talk settlement as per our Rule 26 obligations with
any of the individual plaintiffs.  And what I understand is
we’re not going to do that.  It is either you’re going to be a
part of this process like it or not, and you may like it, you
may not, you don’t know much about it, we can’t tell you much
about it, but we hope that you’ll just stay your actions while
we try to develop what it is or is not.  That doesn’t seem
like it’s a very responsible way to approach this.  There
could also be some discussion on individual claims along the
way especially lawsuits that have already proceeded.  I’m just
going to just give you an example.  I filed the case on behalf
of VE more than 60 days ago.  We’ve already had our Rule 26
conference.  I have an initial pretrial conference still set
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 16 of 52

for December 6.  I would say that trial could be had by July. 
These are very simple cases.  Why in the world would we be
made to stay this case basically for at least 90 more days for
this thing to get set up and time to then go through the
process.  We could have had a trial by the time that we even
learn what this process is, so that I could educate my clients
on whether or not this might or might not be a good deal.  So
I think it only makes sense --
THE COURT:  Which case are you talking about again?
MR. EDWARDS:  VE.  It is --
THE COURT:  Before Judge Nathan?
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes.
THE COURT:  So she has a conference on which day?
MR. EDWARDS:  December 6.  And we held our Rule 26
conference November 15th.
THE COURT:  And do you think this case can go to
trial that fast?
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I’m very familiar
with these cases in that I litigated when Mr. Epstein was
alive these same types of cases for over ten years.  So I’m
intimately familiar with the facts.  They are very simple
cases to try.  I think that by next summer they could be ready
for trial.  But certainly, we are ready to propound discovery. 
We have less than five depositions to take in the case and
we’re ready to go.  I don’t want that to be delayed because
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 17 of 52

we’re trying to set up what is, as you can tell, very slow
developing vague concept that might be acceptable or might
not.  So I just don’t want for the plaintiffs who are already
pursuing these actions to be prejudiced waiting for something
that’s being unilaterally created.  And we don’t have great
confidence that many plaintiffs are going to opt in but we
have an open mind and are willing once it’s set up to engage. 
That’s just not the time right now.  So that’s our position as
it stands.
THE COURT:  Anyone else?
MS. McCAWLEY:  This is Sigrid McCawley and myself
along with David Boies and Josh Schiller, we represent five of
the victims who filed suit to date.
I echo Ms. Kaplan’s concerns.  We have been part of
this dialogue with the reach out to help craft something that
would be responsible and reasonable for the victims who are at
issue here and the fact that the defendants unilaterally
selected a group without that input I think is inappropriate. 
We are learning more about it today obviously so we’ll reserve
final judgment on that.  We are of course open, and our
clients are open, to discussing the possibility of settlement
but I do have significant concerns about what they filed in
the USVI.
THE COURT:  Anyone else?  All right.  For cases to
settle, I’m going to direct this to defendants, for cases to
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 18 of 52

settle there has to be not just interest on both sides but
there has to be seats at the table on both sides.  There has
to be willingness to participate from both sides.  Settlement
is uniquely non-unilateral.  And if the defendants are really
interested in trying to get these cases resolved outside of
the litigation context, then you have to do more than just say
they’re invited to the table and some window of time.  There
has to be a real concerted effort to get people talking to
each other and to get plaintiffs’ counsel on board with what
you’re trying to do.  And they may or may not be so readily on
board.  And you have to, on defendant’s side, be willing to
have an open mind, you know, and have people who are willing
to talk and maybe bend and maybe rethink if plaintiffs have a
different idea and the different idea’s a good one.  So this
being presented to them as well this is what it’s going to be
and you can have some input after we’ve already figured out
some basics may not be sitting real well.
MR. FUDALI:  May I address that, Your Honor?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I don’t think that that’s how we
view this.  Defendants’ counsel are correct.  Many of them
reached out to us and said they would welcome a claims
administration program.  It is true that the co-executors
vetted and carefully selected Ken Feinberg, Jordana Feldman,
and Camille Viras, like I said, unquestionably the leading
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 19 of 52

people in the field, to be independent claims administrators. 
So this is not a situation where we’ve set up a --
THE COURT:  Right.  But they were -- but these
independent claims administrators were selected by one side
and not agreed upon by both.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Absolutely.  And I think Mr.
Feinberg’s 98 percent or so participation rate in the 9/11
fund speaks for itself as well as his experience with the
church sexual abuse system, claims process in the BP oil
spill.  All of these situations, I don’t believe that
claimants went out and hired Mr. Feinberg yet they were very
successful programs.  And here nothing’s been fully baked. 
All that was in the public filing, the very public filing that
I guess I heard some people aren’t aware of the details and I
absolutely encourage them to read it, is that the program is
now going to be set up.  The protocol is everything for how
the program works is my understanding.
THE COURT:  Well, are the names of --
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  And that is when the sides should
come together and the administrators I fully expect and
understand will be in communication if they aren’t already.  I
don’t know.
THE COURT:  Let me interrupt you for a second.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
THE COURT:  Are the names of the administrators, the
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 20 of 52

choice of the administrators, is that fully baked?  Or is
there a possibility to add someone to that group for example?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I don’t know about the latter, but
yes, they have been selected as the administrators.  I mean
another thing I point out is that -- another thing that’s
unusual in this situation is that the estate is subject to the
probate court.  So what was presented to them was a very good
faith above and beyond effort to.  I can assure you, though I
don’t speak for the estate counsel and I don’t speak for the
administrators that the co-executors are hiring Ken Feinberg,
Jordana Feldman, Camille Viras, have a very sincere desire to
have a successful program that can resolve in a much more
efficient resolution of claims in a non-adversarial fashion. 
I mean a lot of careful vetting and due diligence went in on
their end and I do understand that some of the plaintiffs’
lawyers maybe had different picks of who they wanted to be. 
Some of them I should say as well were rather inflexible in
that regard.  And it is correct we didn’t choose necessarily
who their top people are.  But this notion that we’ve gone out
and we’re imposing this vague thing on them I don’t think it’s
fair.  And again, they’re right, it’s voluntary.  I would hope
that they appreciate, like I said, that this is a significant
opportunity to resolve claims that will not result in any
detriment.  
I also want to just quickly touch upon Mr. Edwards
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 21 of 52

raised the timing.  He did litigate cases not in this court. 
I think that’s a very aggressive view of timing on his end. 
We haven’t even answered the complaint and the action which we
have this quote/unquote Rule 26 conference during which we
really didn’t have much to talk about because we haven’t even
answered the complaint.  I view that as maybe that perhaps
fell through on the court’s side, not Your Honor, on whether
that should occur then.  So we had it out of caution.  But
this notion that we’re months away from significant things
happening in these cases, I don’t know what the basis for that
is.
THE COURT:  So some of the questions that have been
raised over here about the size of the fund, what assets are
in the estate, what assets are not in the estate, you said
that claims would not be capped.  But is the fund a certain
amount?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I don’t have the answer to that
question.  Certainly that’s an issue that should be discussed
at this time along with any other issue that plaintiffs want
to raise.  They should call Ms. Feldman, call Mr. Feinberg,
set up times to meet with them.  Again, I don’t speak for
them.  But my understanding is they want to hear from all
interested parties.  They finally made that clear.
THE COURT:  Well, you’re counsel in this case.  So
if cases settle --
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 22 of 52

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
THE COURT:  -- in this Court, I would think you
would need to be involved as well in this process and not
just, you know, refer them to somebody else who’s not
representing a party.  So I think you need to be more
personally involved, you or your firm or one of the firms
involved representing defendants, and try to ensure that there
is good dialogue, that there is good communication, and that
what plaintiffs’ counsel has to say is not falling on deaf
ears, is not, you know, not being responded to.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Agree 100 percent and that’s fully
our intent.  This was just filed a week ago.  And also, we
will be fully involved; however, not at the expense of
inserting ourselves into anything that the administrators view
as solely within their domain as independent claims
administrators.  So there’s a little question there that yes,
we will communicate with them.  We encourage plaintiffs’
counsel to do the same.  We will stay fully involved to find
out what’s going on.
THE COURT:  Will you have authority to settle any
individual case outside of this framework that you’re
discussing?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Settlement discussions are always
welcome.  I don’t have any specific authority in that regard
but no door is closed.
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 23 of 52

THE COURT:  All right.  What I’d like to do with
respect to settlement is have an update after there’s been a
period of time when everyone has been conferring and
plaintiffs have been at the table through their counsel to
give me just a status report on how that’s going and whether
it’s looking promising or whether it’s not from anyone’s point
of view.  And that doesn’t mean other things can’t be handled
on a parallel track.  But I think that settlement is an
important track.  Plaintiffs are clearly interested. 
Defendants are clearly interested.  And when everyone’s
interested in settlement, seems to me that’s the first thing
you want to all try to do.  But it’s got to really be a
process where everyone really has seats at the table, it’s not
just lip service to seats at the table, okay, to discuss any
and everything that seems important to that process including,
you know, how much is in a fund and including, you know, what
is in this estate and not, so that plaintiffs understand, it’s
almost like early disclosure of an insurance policy in a case. 
Well, what is there?  Right.  That’s one thing that’s under
Rule 26(a), a part of it, is to understand on plaintiff’s side
what resources are there that are available towards
settlement.  That’s one reason why that information becomes
important.
All right.  I’m going to move on from that and we’ll
talk about timing at the end with respect to anything and
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 24 of 52

everything.  I know that in some cases defendants haven’t even
been served much less answered and there may also be motions. 
There may also be motions to dismiss.  I know there is at
least a potential statute of limitations issue that’s out
there that defendants may wish to litigate, may not wish to
litigate.  Don’t know.  Can you tell me on defendant’s side
whether there are any motions planned?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, there are motions planned, Your
Honor, and the statute of limitations are certainly relevant
to some of those motions.  I don’t have all the bases for the
motions that we’ll begin filing I believe starting next week. 
And actually, I have a quick question if I can get back to
that on the timing.  Among other things, every plaintiff has
asked for punitive damages but those are expressly barred by
New York statute and other jurisdictions that they may argue
are relevant.  So we will be moving to dismiss claims for
punitive damages as well.  And again, we are developing other
bases for motions.
THE COURT:  Right.  As I said, as far as I know I
don’t have any of these cases for dispositive motions to issue
reports and recommendations on dispositive motions.  So any
such motions remain before the district judge.  I can probably
with respect to most -- different judges are different, but
with respect to most of them, I can probably set a schedule
for the motions, but I’m not going to be the one who decides
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 25 of 52

the motions.  With respect to scheduling, on any motion of any
kind I always appreciate if lawyers talk to one another and
propose briefing schedules because, you know, I’m assuming
you’ll be reasonable.  If it looks unreasonable to me like
we’ll brief this motion in three months and do an opposition
three months later I will say no, you’re not going to do that. 
But most times lawyers can propose sensible schedules and,
like I said, always appreciate it if you talk to one another. 
With respect to discovery, if there are dispositive motions,
that does not necessarily stay discovery.  The default in this
Court is it does not stay discovery.  There has to be an order
from the Court saying discovery is stayed.  But it may make
sense if there is a dispositive motion to stay discovery in
whole or in part, very often what I do in cases is I try to
get a feel for what should be done soon, it’s not overly
burdensome, and where there some reason to do it sooner, what
should be put off until later because maybe you save the money
on it and maybe it’s less important at that initial juncture. 
And I try to do something that is sensible that allows the
case to move in a sensible way with an understanding that
motions are pending.  So when you confer about discovery when
we get there, think about that as well.  Don’t simply argue to
me if there’s a motion that it should be all or nothing.  You
can argue that, but also talk about whether there’s some
compromise approach that makes sense for the particular needs
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 26 of 52

of the particular case.  
With respect to settlement, keep one eye on that
even if you’re engaged in discovery because I’m a firm
believer that there are windows where cases are capable of
being settled.  And sometimes it needs a certain something in
discovery to aid that.  Now, maybe as part of a claims
administration process documentation would be submitted or
would be discussed in that separate process anyway, but it may
be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand
certain discovery before you can figure out the right
settlement for a particular case.  So that might be a higher
priority item because if you want to go toward an early
settlement there may be certain things in discovery that are
particularly important to learn or understand before you are
in a position to accept or reject a proposed settlement or to
make a proposed settlement.
It seems a little bit premature, even though I
wanted to get a jump on these cases, to be setting discovery
schedules especially in cases where there’s not been an
answer, certainly in cases where there’s not even been
service.  And especially in cases where there may be a motion
in lieu of an answer.  But I do want everyone to confer about
discovery and I want everyone to submit proposals.  The more
joint they are, the better.  The more you have really
conferred the better.  When I talk about good faith
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 27 of 52

conference, I don’t mean I sent an email and I didn’t get a
response yet.  When I talk about good faith conference I mean
you picked up the phone, you spoke to each other, you talked
through issues, you tried to work out issues and only if you
can’t then you bring them to my attention.  That goes for
discovery along the way.  I will not even entertain a
discovery dispute if it doesn’t appear to me that you fully
conferred in good faith.
Pet peeve, we’re not there yet, pet peeve I get a
discovery motion, I get an opposition that says we’ll do
certain things, I get a reply that says never mind, I have
wasted my time reading it.  All it tells me is you’ve had a
failure of good faith conference.  You should have been able
to figure that out through talking to each other rather than
spending money on briefing.
I’ll also note, by the way, that Ms. Kaplan, you
sent me, I think you’re the one who sent me three binders of
courtesy copies of things, yes?  Those are your binders?
MS. KAPLAN:  I believe so.  So Your Honor, two
issues.  One, we have an issue about spoliation that we hope
to be decided today.  And two, Judge Failla called us
yesterday and told us that she wanted you to decide the
pseudonymous --
THE COURT:  That’s fine.
MS. KAPLAN:  -- motion in our case.  So that’s what
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 28 of 52

we sent you, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  That’s fine.  You don’t have to spend
your time and money putting together beautiful binders for me. 
I mean it’s very nice, but I have three binders which I’ve
combined into one.  I mean I have three binders combined in
one.  One had, I don’t know, maybe four, three documents and I
said oops, there’s one missing.  So instead of sending the one
that was missing you sent an entire new binder that had four
instead of three.  And then there was another one with
separate tabs and separate letters and separate cover pages
and I just took it all apart and put it all in one and I
really didn’t even need it at all.  But thank you.  And then
in the binders I did get, with respect to the Jane Doe issue,
the one thing that I actually wanted to see which was the two
competing proposed orders, one of those was missing from the
binder.  Defendant’s was not in there.  So come on, if you’re
going to give me binders and you’re going to give me courtesy
copies, at least give me the things that I’m most going to
want to see.  But save your time, save your energy, save your
money.  If it’s something lengthy that has a lot of exhibits
I’m not going to want to print out, yes, courtesy copies are
really appreciated.  But you can just stick a courtesy copy in
an envelope and say here’s a courtesy copy.  I don’t need
things so pretty.  It’s nice but it’s not actually necessary
especially if you ask for fees later and complaining that you
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 29 of 52

spent money on this sort of thing.
MS. KAPLAN:  I apologize, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  That’s okay.
MS. KAPLAN:  I think from our perspective there was
some lack of understanding as to --
THE COURT:  Don’t apologize for trying to be
organized and have a nice presentation.  I appreciate it.  I’m
not trying to be critical.  I’m just saying it’s really not
necessary.  On the John Doe -- John Doe?  Jane Doe, Jane Doe
issues, I have no problem signing an order.  The only question
is what form of order.  And because there are several cases
with Jane Does or somebody Doe, and because many of those, if
not all, most, are going be referred to me for general
pretrial supervision which will include decisions like that,
it would be nice to have some uniformity.  So I know that
Judge Castel has already issued a couple of orders.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I have an update.  I
apologize to interrupt.  I do have an update about this issue.
THE COURT:  You’ve requested that Judge Castel do
something different?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No.  Mr. Edwards and I, recognizing
that uniformity makes sense and recognizing that it would be a
shame to burden the Court with motion, continued motion
practice about this because as we’ve clarified in our
responses that Your Honor may or may not have seen --
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 30 of 52

THE COURT:  You’re going along with the form of
order that Judge Castel issued?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Right.  We don’t object to anonymity
from the general public.  We just want to make sure it doesn’t
come at the expense of our ability to defend the actions.  And
Mr. Edwards and I agreed yesterday in principle to a form
order that I’m going to promptly send him.  I’ll try to do it
today.  This was just late afternoon yesterday.  And I
respectfully submit that it makes sense to have that order
entered in each action.  It strikes the right balance between
protecting the plaintiffs’ anonymity from the general public
and also making sure we are free to defend the case by using
that information without otherwise exposing it to people that
it shouldn’t go to.
THE COURT:  Well, I must say I don’t envy you both
because you’re before a lot of different district judges who
are individuals and will handle cases differently.  Also, you
have a lot of different plaintiffs’ lawyers who are different
and may want to handle cases differently.  On plaintiff’s
side, you know, if you had been, whoever it was -- I’m not
sure who it was who wanted to have the cases all put before
one judge, whether it was defendant’s side that wanted to do
that or plaintiffs’ side.
MS. KAPLAN:  I’m the guilty party, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  If you had been successful in
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 31 of 52

having the cases before one judge, you would have had to have
coordinated among plaintiffs’ counsel either to figure out
who’d be lead counsel or at least who would take the lead on
something like proposing the terms of an order like this.  So
I’m hoping that even though you’re spread out among different
judges, plaintiffs’ counsel can coordinate and can have one
voice for negotiating something like that and have one order,
one form of order that can govern in all of these cases for
anyone who wants to proceed under a pseudonym.  And it may be
because Judge Castel has already entered orders, that’s fine,
but I’m sure he would be fine with my modifying an order to
make it consistent with orders in other cases if that makes
more sense.  Right?  So I understand defendant’s view, I
understand the views that have been articulated by Ms. Kaplan
in her correspondence.  There ought to be a happy medium that
protects anonymity and it still doesn’t prejudice defendants. 
You may have gone a little overboard in the protections you
were seeking.  They can be addressed as we go to some extent. 
See if you can work it out.  Possible to work it out?  I’m
hoping.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Will do, Your Honor.
MS. KAPLAN:  We will try, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  You can do it.  I’m quite
confident you can manage to come up with a proposed order for
anonymity that will make sense and not prejudice anyone’s
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 32 of 52

rights.  
With respect to spoliation, it’s raised in one case,
the Judge Failla case, which is 8673.  I have a simple
response to this.  Counsel should know what their obligations
are and those obligations are pretty clear under the law and
counsel should take them seriously.  If you do not preserve
evidence that should be preserved that you had a reason to
believe was relevant to claims or defenses in the case and
that you didn’t take steps to preserve, there can be negative
consequences down the road.  In order to be confident about
what evidence it is that you better take steps to preserve, it
can’t hurt to be asking plaintiff’s counsel to summarize for
you those things that you think are important if they’re
potentially going to make something of this.  That’s just for
your information.  But ultimately it is defendant’s obligation
to preserve.  I don’t think I should have to tell them that. 
And I don’t plan at this point to issue an order with respect
to preservation unless and until I see something where it
seems fairly clear that there has been, you know, a lack of
preservation or there’s been that conduct.  The one thing that
was brought out by Ms. Kaplan with respect to the need for
spoliation was a story that was reported somewhere in the
press where defendants have said no, you misunderstood what
happened.  At this point I have no reason to doubt what
defendants’ counsel are saying about what happened, so
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 33 of 52

therefore, I have no reason to believe there is bad faith or
bad conduct.  And so therefore, I’m going to deny the request
to order preservation.  I’m only going to remind everyone of
their obligations as counsel to preserve evidence which should
go without saying.
MS. KAPLAN:  The only thing I would add to that,
Your Honor, we’re fine with that, is that Mr. Epstein, as Your
Honor surely knows, has multiple residences in multiple
countries across the world.  And we just want to make sure
that those same efforts are ongoing with respect to every --
the Virgin Islands, Paris, New Mexico, New York, Florida, and
we haven’t gotten that assurance.
THE COURT:  So counsel, you heard it here.  Make
sure your efforts are broad enough.  And this motion is an
example to me of the good faith conference point.  You know,
it seemed to me that further conference about what had
happened with respect to the incident, it seems you did have
some back and forth about this.  But I mean a preservation
order from the Court is fairly significant.  There has to be
something that really spurs it.  And I think on plaintiffs’
side hearing that the story in the press was -- that some bag
had been removed from somewhere which was really not
documents, I gather was some clothing --
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  It was clothing for the decedent to
be laid to rest in, Your Honor.
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 34 of 52

THE COURT:  Yes.  I mean if there’s a reason to
doubt that, there’s a reason to doubt that.  You’ll tell the
Court.  If there isn’t, then we don’t have something
extraordinary.  All right?  But we do have a decedent who had
a lot of property, had a lot of locations where he could be
found at various points in time and the preservation
obligation is going to be fairly broad, still tailored to
what’s relevant to this case but still fairly broad.  And some
of these allegations do go back in time which makes the time
frame for preservation that much more challenging.
All right.  Any other particular issues that anyone
wants to raise?  Pseudonymous, spoliation, anything else? 
Okay.  
So what I’d like you to do is confer among the
plaintiffs’ counsel -- by the way, do you know, do you
anticipate more cases being filed and if so, how many more? 
Can you give me a clue?  Do you know if there are more
plaintiffs’ counsel out there who are likely to be
representing parties?
MR. FUDALI:  Arick Fudali, Your Honor, the Bloom
Firm.  I can tell the Court that we do anticipate filing more
lawsuits in this case.  I can’t say if there’s other plaintiff
attorneys involved.  But from our perspective, I believe at
least at this point there is a plan to file more lawsuits.
THE COURT:  Can you give me an approximate number? 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 35 of 52

I won’t hold you to it.
MR. FUDALI:  I can say less than five probably.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. FUDALI:  But please don’t hold me to that.
THE COURT:  I won’t.  I just wanted to get a feel.
MR. FUDALI:  The other issue is, Your Honor, and
perhaps you were about to address this, but I think to echo
what some of my colleagues said earlier is about clarity.  I
think the problem is that a lot of the plaintiffs are having,
plaintiffs’ attorneys, we’re all in the dark and we’re all
waiting and that’s not something plaintiffs or plaintiffs'
attorneys like to do.  So I don’t know if Your Honor is
willing to --
THE COURT:  In the dark and waiting for what?
MR. FUDALI:  I’m sorry, details of the settlement
program.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. FUDALI:  And I wonder if Your Honor is willing
to set some sort of deadline --
THE COURT:  Yes.  I’m going to do that.
MR. FUDALI:  -- that defendants could give us some
details, that we have something to bring back to our clients.
THE COURT:  Well, I’m going to set a deadline for
reporting back to me on the status of the settlement process
and by that deadline there will have had to have been
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 36 of 52

discussions because I do not want a status report that says we
know nothing, we haven’t been talking, we are in the dark.
MR. FUDALI:  Okay.  Yes.
THE COURT:  Because that would be pointless for a
status report.
MR. FUDALI:  I think just, yeah, we all just want
more detail so our clients can make an informed decision
immediately or at least in the near future so we’re not just
waiting, you know, with deciding.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. FUDALI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
MS. WANG:  Good morning.  Marion Wang.  I just
wanted to inform Your Honor that we filed another case this
morning, so we have a total of three cases.
THE COURT:  I think we saw that one.  We’ve been
checking. 
THE CLERK:  [Inaudible].
THE COURT:  We didn’t see that one?  We saw another
one?
THE CLERK:  [Inaudible].
THE COURT:  Oh, we saw one from yesterday.
MS. WANG:  We filed one yesterday and we filed one
this morning.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. WANG:  So we have three total.  Two are on your
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 37 of 52

appearance list, and so there’s a third one.
THE COURT:  Do you have the docket number on that
one, the case number on that one?
MS. WANG:  Yes, we do.  My colleague does.
THE COURT:  It’s 19-CV something.
MS. WANG:  Yes.  It is 10788.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Can anyone else give me any ideas
to roughly how many more may be coming down the pike?
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, Brad Edwards.  Potentially
dozens more cases could be filed.  I’m just not sure whether
they’re going to be filed here or potentially in the Virgin
Islands or Florida.  So it’s tough to --
THE COURT:  Through your firm?
MR. EDWARDS:  Through our firm.
THE COURT:  Okay.  I would just urge that if you’re
anticipating filing more cases, you try to get on with it and
not have this continuing sort of trickle of cases because
especially if we start setting schedules for things, I’m
trying to have some consistency on how cases are handled.  If
one comes in a month down the road, another one comes in two
months down the road, another one comes in three months down
the road, you’re not going to be on the same schedule. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, I’ll tell you that Mr.
Moskowitz and I have been conferring pretty thoroughly on
issues including the anonymity issue.  And one thing that we
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 38 of 52

have discussed, we filed four cases immediately and since that
time our back and forths have led me to believe that by this
point we would have something more substantive with respect to
this proposal of settlement plan.  And so that’s what we’ve
been waiting for.  To some extent at Mr. Moskowitz’s urging,
and I don’t really hold him --
THE COURT:  You mean before filing more cases?
MR. EDWARDS:  Right, before filing.  So that’s
what -- we don’t want to cloud the Court with a bunch of cases
that ultimately turn out to be unnecessary because they
decided to put the entire estate into this plan and it’s going
to be a good thing.  So we’re kind of in this limbo not
knowing enough information which piggybacks what counsel said
a minute ago.  I think once we get clarity, we’ll be able to
know are there going to be dozens of other cases that need to
be filed or are we going to get somewhere with this
resolution.
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, I would only add to that we
will seek to file anything promptly but as Your Honor may
imagine given the circumstances of this case there are women,
now grown women, who were victimized by Mr. Epstein who for
years and years have kept it hidden living in fear,
traumatized by it.  And my law firm, and I’m sure this is true
for the other firms, literally get a half dozen calls a day
from new women who are reading about this and who say oh my
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 39 of 52

God, you know, maybe --
THE COURT:  I see.
MS. KAPLAN:  And so we can’t control that.  I can
promise you that as soon as we learn of people who we think
have claims we will do everything we can to file as
expeditiously as possible.
THE COURT:  You know, there’s some tension obviously
between any attorney in an existing case that says we want to
move this case and we want to move this case quickly toward
trial.  And you know, some desire to have cases handled in
some kind of way that’s consistent and not know how many more
cases are coming or when they’re coming in.  They don’t have
to all be handled the same way.  They don’t all have to be on
the same schedule.  It can be sort of a basic concept and then
as new cases come in the same sort of concept applies.  But it
may be efficient that if someone is deposed, for example, like
an executor or someone else on the defendant’s side that the
person is not deposed repeatedly.  So you may be able to come
up with an agreement that a deposition in one case can be used
in another case.  But what if it’s by one counsel and you
didn’t have your seat at the table because, you know, you’re a
new attorney coming in and you didn’t have a chance to be
there?  So when you’re thinking about discovery, think about
things like that.  It may make sense to start thinking about
proceeding with certain types of document discovery, holding
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 40 of 52

off on some depositions certainly on defendants’ side because
those may be the same or very similar in a lot of respects. 
Obviously, there are going to be individual stories, but some
of the kinds of questions that I imagine plaintiffs are going
to want to be asking are going to be the same in all the
cases.  So use some thought.
I’m sending you back with things to think about and
things to report back to me on.  I’m not setting any discovery
schedules right now.  That doesn’t mean I want the cases to
just linger and have nothing happen.  But I think it’s a
little bit premature.  I think that it would be -- I just want
to pull up a calendar here because I forgot to bring my
calendar.  We have holidays coming.  We have obviously
Thanksgiving around the corner and then we’re going to hit
December, January time frame.  So my computer doesn’t want to
bring me a calendar year.  I mean ordinarily I’d say 30 days
and get back to me on what’s going on with settlement but
that’s going to run into holiday time.  So I mean if you can
get back to me with a report before the Christmas holidays
hit, that would be great but that may be tight to really have
everybody involved at the table and have some discussion going
on.  And my erstwhile deputy has brought me my calendar.
By the way, this person sitting at the table is
Hannah Martin.  She’s one of my law clerks.  If you want to
call my chambers about something, she’s a good contact person. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 41 of 52

I’m sure she’s thrilled to hear me say that.  If you happen to
be a member of the press, are any members of the press here? 
Look at all these members of the press.  Welcome to my
courtroom.  If you have inquiries, please do not call Hannah. 
Please call the district executive’s office because if you
call us, other than telling you yes it’s true, we have a
conference today at 10 o’clock, or something like that, we’re
going to steer you to the district executive’s office for
press inquiries.  So please just do that in the first
instance.  And they’ll contact us if they need information
from us to pass along to you.  But for litigants -- all right,
so let me look at this calendar.
It is now November 21.  Well, what do you think on
both sides would be rational for reporting back with respect
to status of getting some input on plaintiff’s side, getting
information from defendants, all that?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  So on defendants’ side, two things I
think are relevant to that, Your Honor, recognizing that we
can’t keep, you know, letting things linger because of new
cases coming in as you were alluding to.  Currently with
respect to cases for which response deadlines to complaints
are already set, I believe the last of those response
deadlines runs December 20 or something.  So I think it would
make sense for getting back to the Court to be sometime after
that, not too long.  And obviously, there’s the holidays so
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 42 of 52

maybe a couple of weeks after that would make sense.  Also, in
terms of timing generally, this will come as no surprise I
think to Your Honor, we will, we have and we will continue on
my end to work as diligently as possible to promptly provide
information that we agree should be provided.  Things do take
a little longer given that it’s not just an estate but perhaps
the most complex estate that I’m aware of in existence right
now.  So to get answers to questions that may in some cases be
simple take a little longer in my situation.
THE COURT:  I don’t need a status report that says
we’ve worked it all out.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Right.
THE COURT:  I need a status report that says here’s
the progress that has been made on both sides with attorneys
on both sides confident that there is in fact progress, that
there is in fact a flow of information, that they’re in fact
sitting down and talking about things and that they’re
learning and that they’re engaged and that they have some
hope.  Okay?  That’s what I want to hear.  That’s your
mission.  All right?  And on defendants’ side, it is very much
in your interest to help facilitate this and try to make sure
this happens efficiently because to the extent anyone is
holding off on filing new cases to see if in fact there’s a
workable plan for settlement that will avoid the need for
litigation, the longer it goes where they have doubts that
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 43 of 52

that is in fact a workable plan, the more likely they are,
especially after what I said about trying to coordinate cases,
to just start filing these cases.  I certainly don’t mind -- I
can’t speak to statute of limitation issues and whether this
period of time would matter or not on those issues, but I
don’t mind if you hold off on filing cases if you think that’s
fast because you’re optimistic about a settlement fund.  Use
your judgment about when you file cases.  I’m not going to
direct you when to file them.  But you’ve got a lot of
different balls in the air.  You’ve got when cases are going
to be filed, how many there are, if discovery should move or
should not move, whether they should be coordinated in some
way or not, whether certain discovery should go first and
other discovery later, whether there are going to be
dispositive motions, how that affects whether there should be
discovery.  And all of this with this backdrop of talking
about settlement.  So I’m thinking maybe we’ll just do one
overall status report in all these separate cases before
separate judges.  That may be difficult.  Maybe I can at least
get for each cluster of plaintiff’s’ lawyers the same letter
filed in each of the cases that you have.  If you can all
coordinate, so much the better.  If you can’t, you’ll have to
put them on the docket separately.  But anyway, status reports
on everything, meaning discussions on settlement.  Needless to
say, don’t put confidential details about settlement on ECF. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 44 of 52

Settlement is the one time I’ll hear from you ex parte about
things if we really get there.  If you really want to give me
details like that, send me something ex parte solely on
settlement.  But what I’m looking for at this point is
something more general that you think can be on the public
docket.  So if you can, please put things on the public
docket.  There’s press interest in this case.  Let’s try to
have as much on the public docket as we can.  Okay?  But a
single report that talks (A) about progress of settlement
talks and (B) about a plan for moving forward with the cases. 
And if they have to be case specific, they’re case specific. 
Do what you think you have to do saving money to the extent
you can, breaking it out if necessary.  Use judgment. 
Understand that I’d rather have three letters than 53 letters
but, you know, I’ll read what I have to read.  Okay?  And how
about January 10?  That takes you a couple of weeks past New
Year’s.  Everybody okay with that?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Works for defendants, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Look, if anyone has an
immediate need that comes up between now and then, I’m not
going anywhere including through the holidays.  I’ll be
around.  You can contact my chambers.  Put a letter on ECF. 
Yes.
MR. GOLDFARB:  Thank you, Judge.  Thank you for
allowing us to appear from Miami.  Alan Goldfarb for Jane Doe
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 45 of 52

17.
One suggestion I might offer, Your Honor, is for the
next significant hearing I’d like to hear from whoever the
claims administrator would be and have some answers here in
court so they can participate in explaining this process as to
how they see it instead of hunting back and forth as I think
might happen.  So I actually was hoping you would have had a
pre-Christmas status on that issue alone so we can get some
indication, which is almost 30 days from now, Judge, on how
that process would work here from the horse’s mouth, and we
all hear it at once.  We’re told how this would work, we
understand it, and we go back and decide if we accept that or
not.  You know, January 10th feels a little long for me for the
process.  You’re talking about 90 days.  And I don’t mind
coming back up here to your wonderful city again
Christmastime.
THE COURT:  I didn’t know you were coming but you’re
welcome.
MR. GOLDFARB:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Basically what we did is we put a notice
on the docket on the first group of cases that we were having
a conference and then we started reaching out to counsel in
later filed cases who seemed to already know that there was a
conference.  So we just figured people would show up.  But we
didn’t reach out to anyone in Florida.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 46 of 52

January 10, I’m basically thinking kicking it more
than 30 days because of the holidays.  That’s why January 10. 
But what I’m thinking ought to happen between now and then, I
give it to you for serious consideration, is you folks ought
to schedule a meeting without me.  You ought to schedule a
meeting with the claims administrators and with counsel in
these cases on both sides.  And you ought to sit around a
table and you ought to talk about all the questions and get as
many answers as you can get and try to gain some confidence
that you are all participating and your views are being taken
seriously and valued.  And that’s what I think you ought to do
because in settlement discussions that’s what happens.  People
talk outside of the court about things and try to advance the
ball.  And you do have a lot of people.  And if you talk one
on one, then you have another one on one with a different
lawyer and the message is heard differently or different
questions are asked and answered, you know, you’re going to
have some confusion reigning.  So I would strongly recommend
we not use the courtroom for that meeting at this stage but
that you see if you can set one up and literally bring people
to the table as a settlement discussion.  And then when you
report back, you’ll have something to report back on.  Yes?
MR. BOIES:  Your Honor, David Boies.  I agree
completely with the Court we need to meet among ourselves. 
You got good counsel on both sides here.  I think that we can
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 47 of 52

make progress.  However, my consistent experience over, as Ms.
Kaplan was saying, over a considerable number of years is that
counsel, even with a best faith world, tend to work harder
when they’ve got a appearance before the Court in order to
respond to where they are.  And I think that if -- I would I
think echo what Mr. Goldfarb said which is that if the Court
were to set a conference on December 20th just to sort of
report on where we were in terms of the settlement process and
the administrators, I think that would spur us over the next
days to maybe work harder and more effectively than if we
didn’t have that date.
THE COURT:  Are there any attorneys here in the
courtroom who do not have your personal calendars with you
because they were confiscated at the door?  Do you all have
your calendars?
MALE SPEAKER:  Yes, Your Honor.
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Sure.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  And Your Honor, I mean going back to
exactly what you said about just being practical with the
holidays, I’m out of state that week, December 20th.
THE COURT:  All right.  I’m not scheduling any
conference December 20.  But what I suggest is when I step
down from the bench I suggest that the attorneys stick around
for a minute, compare notes on their availability, see if you
can at least tentatively come up with a couple of dates that
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 48 of 52

might work for a meeting among you.  You’re going to have to
get in touch with the administrators to see if they’re
available which is why more than one date would be useful. 
See if you can get something on the calendar that’s a firm
date to start having real meetings to be able to discuss
things with everybody who wants to be involved involved, and
everyone could hear everyone else’s questions.  I just don’t
think I should be using the courtroom for that at this time.  
MS. KAPLAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  We will.  I
think what you’re hearing, if I could speak from the
plaintiffs’ side, is we’ve been asking for exactly that
meeting now for many weeks, so --
THE COURT:  Okay.  So let’s --
MS. KAPLAN:  -- that’s why you’re hearing the
consternation on our side.
THE COURT:  All right.  Well, we don’t want
consternation.  We don’t want anybody feeling frustrated.  We
want everybody feeling encouraged that there is responsiveness
and that this is going to move forward on a track that
everybody’s going to be optimistic about.  That’s the goal. 
All right?  You are all good counsel and you all understand
the need to work together.  And settlement doesn’t happen
unless people work together.  So let’s start making that
happen.  Try to schedule, you know -- I mean look, you can
provide information, you can provide some information in
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 49 of 52

writing perhaps.  Whatever.  You can start doing that pretty
promptly.  But try to schedule a meeting where you start
talking about this so that by January 10 it’s not just you met
on January 9.  You know, you had a meeting, you started
talking, you had some further dialog, you have some progress
to report.  That’s the goal to have progress to report.  And I
fully agree that having the Court keep tabs makes things
happen that doesn’t otherwise happen which is why even at this
ridiculously early stage for many of these cases you are all
here today because the goal is to take stock of this and to
try to oversee this and to try to make these cases move in an
appropriate way instead of just having lots of separate
squabbles going on, lots of separate issues floating around,
different sorts of letters expressing different sorts of
frustration.  Right?  We’re going to try to have this as
frustration free as possible.  These are serious claims. 
Defense counsel recognizes that.  There are a lot of them. 
There are more to come.  Let’s see if we can get them on a
settlement track that everybody is comfortable with.  And
January 10, one letter, 30 letters, whatever it is, try to
report back on settlement, on motion practice if there’s going
to be motion practice, on discovery proposals if you think
discovery is in order and you know, with lots of thought.  And
to the extent you differ, I’ll see how you differ.  To the
extent you can be of one mind as to how things should proceed,
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 33     Filed 11/26/19     Page 50 of 52

great.  All right?
MS. KAPLAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. FUDALI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  It’s a goal.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Go forth.  Go forth and do.

___________________________________/ 
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, VE, by and through her undersigned counsel, for her claims against 
Defendants, alleges as follows: 
1. 
 The controversy in this cause of action exceeds the sum or value of 
$75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of different States.  
Therefore, jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. section 1332.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 1 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 1 of 48

2. 
Plaintiff files this Complaint under a pseudonym in order to protect her 
identity because this Complaint makes allegations of a sensitive sexual nature the 
disclosure of which, in association with her name, would cause further harm to her. 
3. 
Plaintiff is currently a resident of and domiciled in the state of Florida.   
4. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein travelled 
between and stayed regularly in multiple residences, including in New York, New 
York (within the Southern District of New York) and the United States Virgin 
Islands.  He was a citizen of the United States and a resident of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.  
5. 
At all times material to this cause of action Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male born in 1953, who died on August 10, 2019.  
6. 
Defendant, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein”) 
the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein was opened and domiciled in the United States Virgin 
Islands, St. Thomas Division, and is the legal entity responsible for intentional, 
criminal, or tortious conduct committed by Jeffrey Epstein as described in this 
Complaint.   
7. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation was a domestic business corporation conducting business in New York, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 2 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 2 of 48

with its principal place of business located at 575 Lexington Avenue, Fourth Floor, 
New York, NY 10022.   
8. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Financial Trust Company, Inc. 
was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in New York.   
9. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant NES, LLC, was and is a 
domestic limited liability company registered in and conducting business in New 
York.   
10. 
Corporate Defendants NES, LLC; Financial Trust Company, Inc; Nine 
East 71st Street, referred to as “Defendants,” each performed substantial business in 
New York. 
11. 
Plaintiff intends to amend this complaint to add or substitute additional 
parties as discovery reveals the identities of other negligent corporate or individual 
actors.   
12. 
Jeffrey Epstein was an officer, director, or employee of many corporate 
entities registered in various states throughout the United States, any one of which 
may also bear legal responsibility for the crimes he committed against young 
females, including minors such as Plaintiff.   
13. 
Additionally, individuals who worked at the residences where he 
committed sexual violations, as well as others who assisted him in committing such 
violations, were employed through, or worked for, numerous other corporate entities 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 3 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 3 of 48

whose negligence likely caused or contributed to the sexual violations that caused 
harm to Plaintiff.   
14. 
 The complete universe of those individuals and companies whose 
negligence contributed to the crimes committed by Epstein are currently unknown.  
15. 
As Plaintiff learns through discovery the identities of additional 
individual or corporate entities and the manner in which those others caused or 
contributed to causing harm to Plaintiff through negligence, Plaintiff intends to 
amend to add those parties as well.  Should discovery reveal that any of the currently 
named Defendants are not the proper identity of the Companies identified as current 
Defendants, substitution of parties shall be requested to ensure accuracy and 
correctness of pleading.  
16. 
A substantial part of the acts, events, and omissions giving rise to this 
cause of action occurred in the Southern District of New York; venue is proper in 
this District.  28 U.S.C. section 1391(b)(2). 
17. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein (legally 
represented now through Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (and referred to herein as “Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein”) and Corporate Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat 
her in a non-negligent manner and not to commit, or conspire to commit, or cause to 
be committed intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts against Plaintiff, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 4 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 4 of 48

including any acts that would cause Plaintiff to be harmed through conduct 
committed against her in violation of New York Penal Law section 214-G, New 
York Penal Law section 130.20; or New York Penal Law 130.35; or New York Penal 
Law 130.52; or New York Penal Law 130.66; or New York Penal Law 130.67. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
18. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male over 45 years old.  Epstein was tremendously wealthy, widely recognized as a 
billionaire, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal 
sexual crimes in violation of federal and state statutes and to employ and conspire 
with other individuals and corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes 
or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
19. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his 
employees; to the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his 
direction; to the victims procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to 
advance and carry out and conceal his crimes and torts.   
20. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he 
regularly traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 5 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 5 of 48

31H with tail number N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-
1159B with tail number N909JE).   
21. 
Jeffrey Epstein also travelled between and frequently inhabited and 
travelled between numerous properties and homes, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 valued conservatively 
by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00; a ranch located at 49 Zorro 
Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056 valued conservatively by Jeffrey 
Epstein’s own admission at $17,246,208.00; a home located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida 33480 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own 
admission at $12,380,209.00; an apartment located at 22 Avenue Foch, Paris, France 
75116 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at $8,672,820.00; 
an Island located at Great St. James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, C); 
and an Island Little St. James Island No. 6B USVI 00802 (A, B, C).  See Jeffrey 
Epstein “Asset Summary – June 30, 2019” filed in Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB on July 
15, 2019 attached hereto as Exhibit A.  
22. 
Jeffrey Epstein was otherwise affiliated with the corporations that 
owned or controlled each of the real property listed in the preceding paragraph. 
23. 
The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct 
while at his townhouse in New York and concern the various corporate entities 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 6 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 6 of 48

which provided the opportunity for his illicit conduct to occur and remain concealed 
for years.   
24. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females as young 
as 14 years old.   
25. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor 
children, and took pleasure corrupting vulnerable young females, including minor 
children, into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
26. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees 
and associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the 
purpose of harming teenage girls through sexual exploitation. 
27. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence 
that he got pleasure out of corrupting vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
28. 
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment inclusive of One Count 
of Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part due to 
Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 
East 71st Street.   
29. 
On July 8, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested pursuant to the 
aforementioned Indictment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.    
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 7 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 7 of 48

30. 
The Indictment stated in part, and Plaintiff herein adopts as true, that 
“from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey 
Epstein, the defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New York (the “New York 
Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the “Palm Beach Residence”) to 
engage in sex acts with him, after which the victims were given hundreds of dollars 
in cash.”  Criminal Indictment at 1. 
31. 
“Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, 
Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly 
abused by EPSTEIN.  In this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm 
Beach.”  Criminal Indictment at 1-2.   
32. 
“The victims described herein were as young as 14 years old at the time 
they were abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation.  Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that 
many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18, including because, in some 
instances, minor victims expressly told him their age.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.  
33. 
“In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple 
states to sexually abuse and exploit, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, … worked and conspired 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 8 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 8 of 48

among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with 
EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence.”  Criminal 
Indictment at 2.   
34. 
The indictment further explained, and Plaintiff adopts and alleges, that, 
“[v]ictims were initially recruited to provide ‘massages’ to Epstein, which would be 
performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.   
35. 
“Between at least in or about 2002 and in or about 2005, Epstein abused 
numerous minor victims at the New York Residence by causing these victims to be 
recruited to engage in paid sex acts with him.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.     
36. 
Defendants enabled Jeffrey Epstein to receive near daily massages from 
young females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than 
receive regular body massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing the young 
females in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130. 
37. 
Additionally, employees of the various Defendant corporations 
performed actions or inactions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in 
danger of being sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his 
sexually abusive acts.   
38. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females.  The nature of 
the Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking venture and enterprise enabled victims 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 9 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 9 of 48

themselves to elevate their status to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an 
elevation only made possible through the negligence of Defendants.   
39. 
Recruiters were taught by employees of Defendants to inform targeted 
victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, resources, and 
influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance their 
careers and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body massages 
in order to avail receive his assistance and influence.   
40. 
The collaboration from Defendants and the many employees fulfilled 
Epstein’s compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, 
psychological, financial, and related vulnerabilities. Defendants’ tactics included 
promising the victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission 
into educational institutions, educational tuition, protection, and other things of 
value in exchange for sex and concealment of Jeffrey Epstein’s actions.    
41. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females, 
dated back to at least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased 
substantially with the necessary assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ 
employees.   
42. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, 
and with help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 10 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 10 of 48

recruited or procured dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, 
for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual gratification.  
43. 
Jeffrey Epstein, and consequently Defendants, specifically targeted 
underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or economically disadvantaged young 
females to sexually molest and abuse.   
44. 
Additionally, Defendants through employees, informed young females 
that Jeffrey Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and could either advance or 
destroy the career or education of any young female brought to provide Jeffrey 
Epstein a massage, depending on her degree of cooperation.   
VE 
45. 
Minor victim VE was subjected to the types of illegal sexual acts 
detailed in the Criminal Indictment filed against Jeffrey Epstein by the Southern 
District of New York.  
46. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed abhorrent acts of sexual abuse against 
Plaintiff in 2001 when she was only sixteen years old. 
47. 
In or about 2001, Plaintiff was recruited by another minor child to go 
to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, New York to provide him with a 
“massage.”  
48. 
The minor child who recruited Plaintiff (“Plaintiff’s friend”) informed 
Plaintiff that she would be paid $300 to provide a massage to a man in Manhattan.

49. 
Plaintiff was a minor female with no experience or training in massage.  
50. 
She was recruited under the false pretense that she would be providing 
a legitimate body massage at the mansion owned or controlled by Defendant, Nine 
East.  
51. 
In or about the Fall of 2001, Plaintiff’s friend brought Plaintiff to 
Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide him with a massage.  
52. 
Upon arrival to the mansion, the two minor children were escorted 
inside by an employee of Defendant NES, LLC and taken to Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room.   
53. 
Plaintiff’s friend entered the massage room and left Plaintiff outside the 
door.   
54. 
Moments later, Plaintiff’s friend exited the room and instructed 
Plaintiff to enter the room alone.   
55. 
Plaintiff walked into the dark room which contained a massage table, 
various massage oils, and numerous photographs of nude girls.  
56. 
Unsure of what to expect, Plaintiff waited for the man to arrive for his 
massage.   
57. 
Jeffrey Epstein entered the room and immediately removed his clothing 
before positioning himself on the massage table. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 12 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 12 of 48

58. 
Jeffrey Epstein then provided Plaintiff with instruction on how to 
massage his body.   
59. 
Jeffrey Epstein quickly turned the massage into a sexual encounter with 
the then sixteen-year-old Plaintiff.  
60. 
During the sexual encounter, Plaintiff told Jeffrey Epstein that she did 
not feel comfortable.  Jeffrey Epstein ignored her and continued to engage in the 
improper and illegal sexual contact until he was finished.    
61. 
The sexual encounter ended when Jeffrey Epstein masturbated to 
climax. 
62. 
Plaintiff was paid $300 cash before being escorted out of his mansion, 
all with assistance from Defendants; this payment was made to induce Plaintiff to 
conceal the activities of Epstein and to entice her to return.   
63. 
Plaintiff observed the opulence of the mansion owned by Defendant, 
Nine East, and the organization of Defendant, NES, Inc., which collectively 
facilitated her further cooperation with Jeffrey Epstein, culminating in New York 
Penal Law Section 130 crimes being committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein. 
64. 
Within days, Plaintiff returned to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion wherein 
she endured yet another sexual assault, this time more severe.   
65. 
Plaintiff was taken by elevator to the floor where Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room was located.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 13 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 13 of 48

66. 
Similar to the first time, Jeffrey Epstein appeared wearing only a towel 
and laid face down on the massage table.  Within minutes, he again turned the 
massage into a sexual encounter against the 16-year-old plaintiff.  He instructed her 
to take her clothes off this time.   
67. 
During the second encounter, in addition to harmful, forcible, physical 
touching and sexual exploitation of Plaintiff, Jeffrey Epstein forcibly used a sex toy 
on Plaintiff, forcibly pressing it onto and in Plaintiff’s vagina.   
68. 
Jeffrey Epstein then commanded Plaintiff to straddle him.  Knowing 
that she had no way out of the Mansion, she complied with Jeffrey Epstein’s orders.   
69. 
Jeffrey Epstein moved plaintiff’s panties aside and attempted to insert 
his penis into her vagina, briefly penetrating her, while Plaintiff was resisting.   
70. 
During this encounter, Epstein digitally penetrated Plaintiff. The 
encounter ended with Jeffrey Epstein masturbating to climax.   
71. 
Throughout the duration of the sexual encounter, Plaintiff found herself 
trapped in Jeffrey Epstein’s large mansion under the impression that there was no 
feasible or safe means of escape. 
72. 
All sexual acts were performed by Jeffrey Epstein intentionally and for 
no legitimate purpose and for his own gratification when Plaintiff was a minor child 
less than seventeen years of age.

COUNT III 
NEGLIGENT SECURITY AGAINST  
NINE EAST 71st STREET, CORPORATION 
86. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 above. 
87. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation (hereinafter “Nine East”), was the lawful owner of the property located 
at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, 10021. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 18 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 18 of 48

88. 
Defendant, Nine East, acquired title to the property on September 6, 
1989 and retained such title until the property was transferred to Maple, Inc. on 
December 11, 2011.  
89. 
At all such times, Defendant Nine East maintained legal control over 
the subject premises.  
90. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a regular habitant of Defendant Nine East and in 
fact resided at the premises when he was present in New York.  
91. 
Defendant knew or should have known when Defendant was in the 
home owned by Defendant Nine East when Epstein had young females, including 
minor females such as Plaintiff.   
92. 
When Plaintiff was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein in 2001, 
Defendant, Nine East, as the owner of the property where all of the sexual abuse 
occurred, had a non-delegable duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe 
condition.  
93. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty additionally included the duty to take 
precautions to protect guests, visitors, or invitees from foreseeable harm, including 
foreseeable criminal conduct.  
94. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty further included the duty to take 
reasonable precautionary measures to minimize the risk of criminal acts upon 
visitors.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 19 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 19 of 48

95. 
Most important, Defendant had a duty to take protective measures when 
it could be shown that the company possessing, owning, or controlling the property, 
knew or had reason to know from past experience that there was a likelihood of 
conduct that would endanger a visitor.   
96. 
To establish foreseeability, the criminal conduct at issue must be 
reasonably predictable based on the prior occurrence of the same or similar criminal 
activity at a location sufficiently proximate to the subject location. 
97. 
No conduct becomes more foreseeable or predictable than the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein, in which he engaged regularly, if not daily, when he was 
in Defendant’s property.  
98. 
Nearly every day that Jeffery Epstein was on or in the property of 
Defendant Nine East, he was engaging in criminal sexual behavior in violation of 
New York Penal Code Section 130.  
99. 
Defendant knew or should have known of Jeffrey Epstein’s propensity 
for sexually abusing minor children, including regularly on the premises.  
100. 
Defendant knew of should have known from past experience that there 
was a high likelihood that Jeffrey Epstein would engage in foreseeable criminal 
conduct that was likely to seriously endanger or injure a visitor, including Plaintiff.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 20 of 30

101. 
Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff by failing to take even minimal 
safety precautions to protect against the predictable criminal acts of Jeffrey Epstein, 
which were reasonably predictable and foreseeable to occur on the property.  
102. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
103. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, the Plaintiff has 
in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT IV 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST 
FINANCIAL TRUST COMPANY, INCORPORATED 
104. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 above. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 21 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 21 of 48

105. 
At all times material hereto, Financial Trust Company, Inc. (hereinafter 
“Financial Trust”) was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in 
New York.   
106. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Financial Trust, employed 
Jeffrey Epstein.  
107. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, had a duty to exercise reasonable care to 
refrain from retaining in its employ a person with known dangerous propensities in 
a position that would present a foreseeable risk of harm to others.   
108. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to satisfy the personal needs 
of Jeffrey Epstein, which included daily massages which Epstein requires to be 
sexual in nature.   
109. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s requirement that he receive regular massages from 
untrained young females caused Defendant and its employees to knowingly turn a 
blind eye to the dangerous sexual addictive propensities of Jeffrey Epstein, despite 
knowledge that he would cause harm to many young females including Plaintiff, in 
order to retain its most valuable employee—Jeffrey Epstein.  
110. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to further Jeffrey Epstein’s 
goal to obtain, recruit, and procure young females for the purposes of providing 
sexually explicit massages to Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 22 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 22 of 48

111. 
During the course and scope of his employment for Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein did fulfill the corporate objective of receiving sexual massages procured for 
him by employees of Defendant.  
112. 
Jeffrey Epstein was notorious for converting each massage into a 
sexually exploitive activity in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130, a fact 
which was known or should have been known in the exercise of reasonable care by 
Defendant.  
113. 
Even though Defendant, Financial Trust, knew of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
propensity for the sort of behavior that caused Plaintiff’s harm and Jeffrey Epstein’s 
constant engagement in this type of criminal behavior during the course and scope 
of his employment, Defendant retained Jeffrey Epstein and failed to properly 
supervise him.  
114. 
Jeffrey Epstein did not have a set work schedule or office but instead 
conducted business on behalf of the corporation from various locations all over the 
world.   
115. 
While conducting said business, Jeffrey Epstein was frequently using 
corporate finances in furtherance of his sexually explicit behavior.   
116. 
Upon information and belief, at times other employees of the Defendant 
corporation were coordinating these sexually explicit massages for Epstein to engage 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 23 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 23 of 48

in during business hours, while he was within the course and scope of his 
employment for Defendant.  
117. 
In fact, while Jeffrey Epstein was conducting business telephone calls 
or authorizing company actions on behalf of Defendant, Financial Trust, he would 
frequently be receiving a sexually explicit massage.   
118. 
In certain circumstances, sexually explicit massages provided by young 
women, oftentimes minor children, who were untrained in the art of massage, were 
coordinated by another employee of Defendant who knew or should have known 
that the massage was being conducted by an underage girl for the exclusive purpose 
of committing sexual crimes against her.  
119. 
Jeffrey Epstein engaged in this type of sexually abusive behavior on a 
daily basis to the extent that engaging in sexual massages became the most regular 
activity that he engaged in while in the course and scope of his employment.  
120. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual routine of recruiting and engaging in sexually 
explicit massages began many years before the formation of Defendant and was not 
a lifestyle unknown to Defendant, Financial Trust.  
121. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care 
should have known that Jeffrey Epstein was potentially dangerous, had engaged in 
a pattern of criminal sexual behavior against young females, including minors, for 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 24 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 24 of 48

years prior to the formation of Defendant Financial Trust, and that he was not going 
to cease committing criminal sexual acts.   
122. 
Jeffrey Epstein was retained with knowledge of the propensity of this 
sort of behavior.   
123. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, retained Jeffrey Epstein with knowledge 
that he would in fact injure others, such as Plaintiff, during the course and scope of 
his employment.  
124. 
Despite such knowledge, Financial Trust knowingly placed Jeffrey 
Epstein in a position to cause foreseeable harm, which could have been prevented 
had Defendant taken reasonable care in making decisions regarding the retention and 
supervision of Jeffrey Epstein.  
125. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
126. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical

and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 above. 
128. 
It is believed that each employee of Defendant, NES, operated at the 
direction of Jeffrey Epstein.  
129. 
Upon information and belief, the primary responsibility of each 
employee of Defendant, NES, LLC (“NES”) was to fulfill the needs or requests of 
Jeffrey Epstein; more particularly, his daily massage schedule.  
130. 
Upon information and belief, the employees of Defendant, NES, were 
compensated to primarily, if not exclusively, procure or maintain each young female 
masseuse, or to assist, knowingly or unknowingly, in the concealment of any 
misconduct committed against each masseuse.  
131. 
Upon information and belief, the employment responsibilities of the 
various employees of Defendant, NES, included but were not limited to: 1) recruiting

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 26 of 48

young females, including minor children such as Plaintiff, to provide massages, 2) 
creating Jeffrey Epstein’s massage schedule, 3) maintaining Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage schedule, 4) escorting various young females into the massage room at the 
New York mansion owned by Defendant Nine East, 5) maintaining contact with the 
various young females who were recruited to the New York mansion for the 
purposes of providing Jeffrey Epstein with a massage, 6) providing compensation to 
each young masseuse upon the completion of her engagement with Jeffrey Epstein, 
7) providing meals and food and other services to the young females in order to 
provide an air of legitimacy to the functions of the corporation, 8) providing 
hospitality services to the young females in order to provide an air of legitimacy to 
the functions of the corporation, 9) providing educational services, 10) providing 
medical services, 11) providing transportation services, 12) providing housing 
services, 13) providing various other enticements to ensure the continued 
cooperation of the various young female masseuse with Defendant NES’s corporate 
objective, 14) encouraging individuals, including the females who were recruited to 
the house to provide a massage to recruit other young females to engage in the same 
activity for Jeffrey Epstein, and 15) coordinating together and with Jeffrey Epstein 
to convey a powerful and legitimate enterprise system capable of gaining 
cooperation from young females recruited for massage, often minors such as 
Plaintiff.

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 27 of 48

132. 
In fulfilling their employment responsibilities, each employee 
voluntarily assumed a duty with respect to each young female recruited to massage 
Jeffrey Epstein, including Plaintiff.  
133. 
To fulfill said duty, each employee was required to perform their 
assumed duty carefully without omitting to do what an ordinarily prudent person 
would do in accomplishing the task.  
134. 
The young females being recruited to engage in massages for Jeffrey 
Epstein were inexperienced in the art of massage, a fact that was known or should 
have been known to Defendant NES and its employees in the exercise of reasonable 
care.  
135. 
Plaintiff relied on Defendant NES’s voluntary assumption of a duty as 
well as the voluntary assumption of each individual employee to act with reasonable 
care towards her.   
136. 
In the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant and its employees further 
knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of Jeffrey Epstein and the 
proximate harm that would be caused by his likely sexual misconduct and various 
violations of New York Penal Law Section 130.  
137. 
The failure of Defendant NES and each of its respective employees to 
act in the same manner as an ordinarily prudent person, placed Plaintiff in a more 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 28 of 30
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 28 of 48

vulnerable position than if Defendant and its employees had not assumed the 
obligation to treat her with reasonable care.   
138. 
In breaching its Duty, NES launched a force or instrument of harm 
directed toward Plaintiff.  In doing so, Defendant, NES, enhanced the risk Plaintiff 
faced and caused her to forego any opportunity she may otherwise have had to avoid 
the risk inherent with being in a room alone with Jeffrey Epstein to perform a 
massage as an untrained minor child.  
139. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
140. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against NES, Inc, for 
compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive damages and such 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3   Filed 08/20/19   Page 29 of 30

other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  Plaintiff hereby demands 
trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

COUNT ONE 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3-2   Filed 08/20/19   Page 3 of 15
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 36 of 48
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
• age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3-2   Filed 08/20/19   Page 4 of 15
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 37 of 48
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3-2   Filed 08/20/19   Page 5 of 15
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 38 of 48
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3-2   Filed 08/20/19   Page 6 of 15
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 39 of 48
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN   Document 3-2   Filed 08/20/19   Page 7 of 15
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 40 of 48
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 41 of 48
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters.

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 37-1     Filed 11/29/19     Page 42 of 48
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Estate”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation (“Nine East”), Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. (“FTC”), and NES, LLC (“NES”, and together with Nine East and FTC, the 
“Corporate Defendants”; and the Corporate Defendants together with the Estate, the 
“Defendants”)  respectfully submit this Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to 
Dismiss Counts I and III - V of Plaintiff VE’s  (“Plaintiff”) First Amended Complaint1 (the 
“Amended Complaint”) (Doc. # 3) 2 in their entity and Count II to the extent it is time barred 
with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Plaintiff’s allegations, which are assumed to be true solely for purposes of this Motion, 
present a discernable though partially time-barred battery claim against Decedent Jeffrey E. 
Epstein (“Decedent”) and vague, conclusory negligence claims against the three Corporate 
Defendants.  Plaintiff alleges Decedent sexually abused Plaintiff in 2001 when she was sixteen 
years old. (Am. Compl. ¶ 46.) Plaintiff asserts five causes of action in her Complaint: two 
duplicative battery claims against the Estate (Counts I and II) and a negligence claim against 
each Corporate Defendant (Counts III – V, respectively).  The Estate, while preserving all rights 
and legal positions, does not hereby seek to dismiss both claims against it in their entirety. 
However, Plaintiff’s first battery claim should be dismissed for two reasons.  First, this 
claim is outside the scope of the New York Child Victims Act (“CVA”) and thus completely 
time barred.  Second, this cause of action is duplicative of and subsumed by Plaintiff’s second 
battery claim.  The second battery cause of action is itself time barred to the extent it is based on 
occurrences after Plaintiff turned 18.  
Plaintiff amended her Complaint before completing service on Defendants.  
A copy of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Bennet J. Moskowitz 
submitted herewith.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 5 of 16

-2- 
The Court should also dismiss Plaintiff’s negligence claims against the Corporate 
Defendants because they are based on threadbare recitals of the elements of negligence causes of 
action and conclusory statements, as well as impermissible group pleading.  Plaintiff effectively 
concedes she did not have solid grounds to name the Corporate Defendants in this action,  
alleging: “[s]hould discovery reveal that any of the currently named Defendants are not the 
proper identity of the Companies identified as current Defendants, substitution of parties shall be 
requested to ensure accuracy and correctness of pleading.” (Id. ¶ 15 (emphasis added).)   
Plaintiff’s demands for punitive damages must also be dismissed.  New York Estates, 
Powers And Trusts Law expressly provides punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties 
adjudged in any personal injury action brought to recover damages from an estate. 
I. 
ALLEGED FACTS 
Plaintiff alleges that in 2001 a minor identified only as “Plaintiff’s friend” – and not 
anyone else, whether an employee of any Corporate Defendant or otherwise – “recruited” 
Plaintiff, who was then 16 years old, to give a massage to Decedent at his personal residence. 
(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 47-48.)  Plaintiff alleges the massage became a “sexual encounter” following 
which Decedent paid Plaintiff money. (Id. ¶¶ 59 – 62.)  Plaintiff further alleges she returned to 
Decedent’s residence “within days” where she experienced “another sexual assault” by 
Decedent. (Id. ¶ 64.).  
Based on these allegations related entirely to conduct allegedly committed by Decedent, 
Plaintiff claims the Corporate Defendants are somehow liable to her.  Plaintiff alleges without 
any supporting factual allegations that the Corporate Defendants “owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat 
her in a non-negligent manner and not to commit, or conspire to commit, or cause to be 
committed intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts against Plaintiff.” (Id. ¶ 17.)    
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 6 of 16

-3- 
Aside from such conclusory recitals of elements of negligence causes of action, many 
made “upon information and belief,” labels and group pleading that lumps the Corporate 
Defendants together, Plaintiff does not allege any specific facts concerning Nine East and FTC 
except the following innocuous background assertions: Nine East was a New York corporation 
(id. ¶ 7) that owned or controlled Decedent’s personal residence where the alleged sexual 
assaults took place (id. ¶¶ 7, 50); and FTC was a U.S. Virgin Islands Corporation conducting 
business in New York (id. ¶ 8).  Further, and also excluding mere labels and conclusions, 
Plaintiff’s sole specific factual allegations against NES are that it was a New York limited 
liability company whose employee escorted Plaintiff into Decedent’s residence (id. ¶52)—but 
not any specific facts suggesting let alone unequivocally stating the unidentified employee 
witnessed or even knew about the alleged sexual assaults.  
II.
ARGUMENT 
a.
Legal Standard: Plaintiff’s legal conclusions and contradictory allegations 
are not accepted as true. 
Although the Court must normally accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in a 
complaint and draw all inferences in a plaintiff’s favor, those principles are inapplicable to legal 
conclusions. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 
U.S. 544, 555, 556 (2007)).  Thus, a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or “a 
formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 
(2007).  Moreover, “‘[w]here [the] plaintiff’s own pleadings are internally inconsistent, a court is 
neither obligated to reconcile nor accept the contradictory allegations in the pleadings as true in 
deciding a motion to dismiss.’” Whitley v. Bowden, No. 17-cv-3564 (KMK), 2018 WL 2170313, 
at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018) (quoting Carson Optical Inc. v. eBay Inc., 202 F. Supp. 3d 247, 
255 (E.D.N.Y. 2016)). 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 7 of 16

-4- 
b.
Plaintiff’s first battery claim (Count I) is time barred and must be dismissed. 
Plaintiff’s first cause of action, which asserts a claim for battery separate and apart from 
her claim for battery in violation of NY Penal Law § 130, expired over a decade ago.  Under 
New York law, actions for battery must be commenced within one year (CPLR § 215(3)); and 
actions for personal injury must be commenced within three years (CPLR § 214(5)).  However, 
because Plaintiff alleges she was a minor at the time of the alleged battery, her time to file her 
battery claim was tolled until she turned eighteen. CPLR § 208.  
Plaintiff alleges the battery against her occurred in 2001 when she was sixteen years old. 
(Compl. at ¶¶ 46-47, 51, 92.)  Therefore, Plaintiff turned eighteen in 2003.  Plaintiff’s battery 
claim expired in 2004 (or, if considered a claim for personal injury, in 2006), long before she 
filed this action in August 2019.  
The CVA does not alter this result.  The CVA created a one-year period in which civil 
claims alleging damages “suffered as a result of conduct which would constitute a sexual offense 
as defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal law committed against a child less than 
eighteen years of age” could be filed despite otherwise having expired. CPLR § 214-g (emphasis 
added).  Thus, the CVA does not revive causes of action unless they are based on NY Penal Law 
§130 offenses. Id.  Plaintiff’s Count I for battery, which is distinct from Plaintiff’s claim for 
battery in violation of NY Penal Law § 130, is untimely and must be dismissed.  
c.
Plaintiff’s first battery claim must be dismissed because it is duplicative of 
Plaintiff’s second battery claim. 
Even assuming Count I states a NY Penal Law § 130 offense, which it does not, it must 
be dismissed as entirely duplicative of Count II.  See Price v. L’Oreal USA, Inc., 17-cv-0614, 
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165931, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2017) (“Defendants’ motion to dismiss 
the unjust enrichment claim under New York law (see Count V) is granted because it is 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 8 of 16

-5- 
duplicative of the other claims.”).  Counts I and II are based on the same alleged occurrences and 
seek the same relief.  Therefore, it would serve no legitimate purpose to permit Plaintiff to 
pursue both claims.  Count I should be dismissed for this additional reason.  
d.
Plaintiff’s negligence claims against the Corporate Defendants must be 
dismissed because they are based on conclusory statements and 
impermissible group pleading—not facts. 
Plaintiff failed to allege “enough facts” to state any negligence claim against the 
Corporate Defendants “that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 
570 (2007) (emphasis added).  It is well-settled that Plaintiff must demonstrate grounds for relief 
beyond mere “labels and conclusions.” Id. at 555.  Rather, to state a claim, Plaintiff’s Complaint 
must set forth “[f]actual allegations [that are] … enough to raise a right to relief above the 
speculative level.” Id.  “Though the Court must accept the factual allegations of a complaint as 
true, it is ‘not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.’” Swan 
Media Grp., Inc. v. Staub, 841 F. Supp. 2d 804, 806 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). 
Additionally, “[w]here a complaint names multiple defendants, that complaint must 
provide a plausible factual basis to distinguish the conduct of each of the defendants. … A 
plaintiff cannot merely lump all the defendants together in each claim and provide no factual 
basis to distinguish their conduct.” Ochre LLC v. Rockwell Architecture Planning & Design, 12-
cv-2837, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172208, at *16-17 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 28, 2012) (citing Atuahene 
v. City of Hartford, 10 Fed. App’x 33, 34 (2d Cir. 2001)). 
With respect to the allegations against the Corporate Defendants, and as explained more 
fully below, Plaintiff has not made factual allegations sufficient to “raise the right to relief above 
the speculative level.” See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Besides generic conclusions that the 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 9 of 16

-6- 
Corporate Defendants “provided the opportunity” (Compl. ¶ 23), “collaborat[ed]” (id. ¶ 40), 
gave “the necessary assistance” (id. ¶ 41) and the like, there are no alleged facts describing what 
any of the Corporate Defendants’ employees or other agents did or failed to do that was 
negligent or how such negligence proximately caused Plaintiff’s alleged damages.  Further, most 
of Plaintiff’s allegations about the Corporate Defendants impermissibly lump their conduct 
together. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 23, 37-44, 62-63.)  The Corporate Defendants cannot reasonably 
prepare a response to such conclusory, vague claims, which are hereby further addressed in turn. 
i.
Plaintiff’s “negligent security” claim against Nine East (Count III) 
must be dismissed because it is based on labels and conclusions and is 
contradicted by Plaintiff’s own allegations.  
Count III fails to state a claim because, aside from labels and conclusions, the Complaint 
is devoid of any facts concerning Nine East except that it owned real property where torts against 
Plaintiff allegedly took place—hardly enough to “raise the right to relief above the speculative 
level.” See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Though far from clear, Plaintiff’s legal theory against 
Nine East appears to be that, because Nine East owned Decedent’s New York residence where 
the alleged torts took place, Nine East is necessarily liable to Plaintiff for Decedent’s alleged 
conduct. This is not the law in New York. See 85 NY Jur Premises Liability § 212 (2) 
(“Generally, the law does not impose a duty to control the conduct of third persons to prevent 
them from harming others even where, as a practical matter, the defendant could have exercised 
such control.”). 
Moreover, to sufficiently allege a “negligent security” cause of action, the Plaintiff must 
allege facts establishing: (i) Nine East owed Plaintiff a duty; (ii) Nine East breached that duty; 
and (iii) injury to Plaintiff substantially caused by that breach.  Sofia v. Esposito, 17-cv-1829, 
2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60947, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2018) (quoting Pasternack v. Lab. 
Corp. of Am. Holdings, 807 F.3d 14, 19 (2d Cir. 2015)).   Other than conclusions reciting these 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 10 of 16

elements, which are insufficient to state a claim, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, Plaintiff does not allege 
any facts establishing Nine East owed her a duty, how Nine East breached any duty or how any 
such breach caused Plaintiff’s alleged damages.  
There are no allegations connecting Plaintiff’s visits to Decedent’s personal residence 
with any negligence on the part of any employees or other agents of Nine East.  Plaintiff does not 
even identify any such employees or agents. 
To the contrary, Plaintiff alleges her “friend,” not someone acting on behalf of Nine East, 
caused Plaintiff to visit the real property owned by Nine East. (Compl. ¶¶ 47, 51-61.) Plaintiff 
further alleges that she returned to the real property “within days” (id. ¶¶ 64-72) without 
claiming that was at a specific person’s behest.   
Plaintiff also alleges the “opulence of the mansion … facilitated [Plaintiff’s] further 
cooperation with Decedent.” (Id. ¶ 63.)  Such allegations are inconsistent with any suggestion 
that Nine East is liable to Plaintiff due to actions of Nine East’s agents.  The Court is not 
obligated to reconcile or accept Plaintiff’s contradictory allegations as true. Whitley, 2018 WL 
2170313, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018).  Accordingly, Count III for negligent security against 
Nine East must be dismissed for failure to state a claim. 
ii.
Plaintiff’s negligence claim against FTC (Count IV) must be dismissed 
because it is also based on labels and conclusions and is otherwise 
contradicted by Plaintiff’s own allegations. 
Plaintiff’s negligence claim against FTC is similarly deficient. Plaintiff’s legal theory 
concerning FTC appears to be that, because FTC employed Decedent when the alleged torts took 
place, FTC is necessarily liable to Plaintiff—i.e., negligent supervision of an employee.  Under 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 11 of 16

-8- 
New York law, in addition to the elements of negligence,3 a plaintiff alleging negligent 
supervision must show: (1) the tortfeasor and the defendant were in an employee-employer 
relationship; (2) the employer knew or should have known of the employee’s propensity for the 
conduct which caused the injury prior to the injury’s occurrence; and (3) the tort was committed 
on the employer’s premises or with the employer’s chattels. Man Zhang v. City of N.Y., 17-cv-
5415, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163485, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Sep. 19, 2019) (citing Green v. City of 
Mount Vernon, 96 F. Supp. 3d 263, 297 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Ehrens v. Lutheran Church, 385 F.3d 
232, 235 (2d Cir. 2004)).   
As with Count III, Count IV is supported by nothing more than mere labels and 
conclusions regarding FTC’s so called negligent conduct.  For example, Plaintiff alleges the 
sexual assaults occurred “during the course and scope of employment for [FTC]” (Compl. ¶ 111) 
without asserting factual allegations as to how or why that was the case.  
Plaintiff failed to allege any facts beyond labels and conclusions establishing FTC owed 
Plaintiff any duty, breached that duty and that such breach injured her.  Nor does Plaintiff allege 
specific facts showing FTC knew or should have known Decedent’s propensity for the conduct 
that allegedly caused Plaintiff’s injuries.   
Plaintiff’s allegation against FTC made “upon information and belief” -- that “at times 
other employees of the Defendant corporation were coordinating these sexually explicit 
massages for Epstein to engage in during business hours, while he was within the course and 
scope of his employment for Defendant” -- fails to rescue Plaintiff’s cause of action against FTC.  
In addition to being conclusory and thus otherwise failing to satisfy the pleading standards set 
forth in Twombly and Iqbal, Plaintiff’s allegation does not raise a right to relief above 
As explained above, under New York law, a plaintiff must establish the following elements to state a claim for 
negligence: (i) a duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant; (ii) breach of that duty; and (iii) injury substantially 
caused by that breach. Sofia, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60947 at *10. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 12 of 16

speculation. See Gilford v. NYS Office of Mental Health, No. 17-CV-8033 (JPO), 2019 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 38450, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 11, 2019) (“No matter what the pleading standard is, her 
complaint must at least contain enough factual allegations that are not made upon information 
and belief to ‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level.’” (emphasis added) (citing 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555)). 
Plaintiff’s allegations are also inconsistent with her legal theory that FTC is somehow 
liable for Decedent’s misconduct.  Plaintiff alleges the torts occurred on Nine East’s premises, 
not FTC’s premises.  Further, Plaintiff alleges Decedent sexually abused Plaintiff “intentionally 
and for no legitimate purpose and for his own gratification,” (id. ¶ 72)—not that Decedent 
performed the sexual acts in the course or scope of his employment by FTC.  As explained 
above, the Court is neither obligated to reconcile nor accept such contradictory allegations as 
true. Whitley, 2018 WL 2170313, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018).   
The most plausible reading of the Complaint is that FTC’s employment of Decedent had 
nothing to do with his alleged sexual assaults of Plaintiff.  Without factual allegations explaining 
how FTC acted negligently or how that negligence proximately caused Decedent’s alleged 
injuries, the Complaint does not plausibly state a claim against FTC.  Therefore, Count IV must 
be dismissed. 
iii.
Plaintiff’s negligence claim against NES (Count V) must be dismissed 
because it is based on conclusory allegations made largely “upon 
information and belief.” 
Plaintiff’s claims against NES are especially deficient.  Plaintiff’s allegations against 
NES are comprised of vague assertions made “upon information and belief” (see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 
130 (“Upon information and belief, the employees of Defendant, NES, were compensated to 
primarily, if not exclusively, procure or maintain each young female masseuse”; see also id. ¶¶ 
127 – 129, 131) and conclusory recitals of elements of an unspecified negligence cause of action 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 13 of 16

-10- 
(see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 139 (“Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law.”); see also id. ¶¶ 
132 – 138, 140).  
Aside from labels and conclusions, Plaintiff fails to allege facts establishing the elements 
of a negligence claim against NES.  Thus, Plaintiff does not allege facts establishing NES owed 
her a duty or breached such a duty.  Sofia, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60947 at *10.  Nor does 
Plaintiff allege any facts explaining how anything an NES employee or agent did or failed to do 
proximately caused Plaintiff’s alleged damages. Id.   
The only non-background fact Plaintiff alleges as to NES is a single ambiguous 
allegation that one of its employees “escorted” Plaintiff into Decedent’s residence before the first 
sexual assault occurred. (Id. ¶52.)  Plaintiff neither identifies the employee nor alleges the 
employee saw or otherwise knew about the alleged sexual assault.  
Plaintiff’s allegations are also incompatible with a cause of action against NES.  Plaintiff 
alleges two instances of sexual assault by Decedent.  Plaintiff claims her “friend,” not an NES 
employee, recruited Plaintiff to visit Decedent when the first assault allegedly occurred. (Id. ¶ 
47.)  Plaintiff alleges the second assault took place “within days,” without alleging any 
intervening factor such as conduct by an NES employee or otherwise. (Id. ¶ 64.)  As the 
Complaint does not plausibly allege NES acted negligently or how such negligence was the 
proximate cause of Plaintiff’s alleged injuries sustained as a result of alleged sexual assault 
committed by Decedent, Count V must also be dismissed for failure to state a claim. 
e.
Plaintiff’s claims for punitive damages must be dismissed because they are 
precluded by NY EPTL § 11-3.2.  
Plaintiff may not recover punitive damages in this action as a matter of law.  New York 
Estates, Powers And Trusts Law provides: “No cause of action for injury to person or property is 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 38     Filed 11/29/19     Page 14 of 16

-11- 
lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury. For any injury, an action may be 
brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive damages 
shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover damages for 
personal injury.” NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (emphasis added).  “Also, ‘there is a strong policy 
against the assessment of punitive damages against an estate on account of wrongful conduct of 
the decedent.’” Graham v. Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (quoting Blissett v. 
Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996)). 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant their Motion 
to Dismiss in its entirety together with such other and further relief as the Court deems just and 
proper.

Dear Judge Nathan: 
We represent Plaintiff VE in the above-captioned action.  Plaintiff filed her First Amended

Memorandum of Law [DE 38]. 
Pursuant to your Honor’s individual practices, this letter is intended to notify the Court and 
Defendants in writing that Plaintiff does not intend to file an amended pleading at this time and will rely 
on her current First Amended Complaint, which she will defend in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to 
Dismiss in accordance with the rules of this Court.

Plaintiff, VE, by and through her undersigned counsel, opposes Defendants’ Motion to 
Dismiss her Amended Complaint, and states as follows. 
I. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
In 2001, Plaintiff was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein when she was only sixteen years 
old.  [Amended Complaint, DE 3 ¶ 46].  As alleged in detail in the Amended Complaint, Jeffrey 
Epstein committed these abhorrent acts of sexual abuse against Plaintiff after she “was recruited 
by another minor child to go to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, New York to provide him 
with a “massage.” Id. at ¶ 46, 47.  Pursuant to the New York Child Victims Act (“CVA”), Plaintiff 
has a clear viable claim against Jeffrey Epstein for the abhorrent sexual violations that he 
committed against her. However, Jeffrey Epstein could not have and did not act alone.  
Jeffrey Epstein was an officer, director, employee, or owner of many corporate entities 
registered in various states throughout the United States, many of which also bear legal 
responsibility for the crimes that he committed against Plaintiff.  Id. at ¶ 12.  For example, 
Employees of Defendants who worked at the residences where he committed sexual violations as 
well as others who assisted him in committing such violations, were employed through, or worked 
for, the corporate entities named herein whose negligence caused or contributed to the sexual 
violations committed against Plaintiff. Id. at ¶ 13.  There can be no doubt that Defendant, Nine 
East 71st Street, as owner of the home wherein Plaintiff was sexually abused was negligent as the 
property owner who had a non-delegable duty to keep Plaintiff safe, which it clearly failed to do.  
Moreover, Defendants Financial Trust Company and NES, LLC both acted in a similar 
manner insofar as they each employed individuals whose sole purpose was to further Jeffrey 
Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise, which included the victimization of Plaintiff.  In fact, 
Defendant Corporations named in Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint performed actions or inactions 
that further placed Plaintiff in danger of being sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and assisted in 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 5 of 17

the concealment of his sexually abusive acts.  Id. at ¶ 37.  The recruiters were taught by employees 
of Defendants to inform targeted victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, 
resources, and influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance their 
careers and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body massages in order to avail 
receive his assistance and influence.  Id. at ¶ 39-44.  
Plaintiff has clearly made sufficient allegations within the four corners of her Amended 
Complaint to establish causes of action against Defendant Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Nine East 
71st Street, Corp., Financial Trust Company, Inc., and NES, LLC.  To the extent that the Court 
finds Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint deficient in any way, Plaintiff respectfully requests that she 
be granted leave to amend her Complaint as Jeffrey Epstein and these Defendants should be held 
responsible for the harm that they have each respectively caused Plaintiff.  Defendant Corporations 
should not be permitted to abscond from liability when their very actions and inactions caused 
Plaintiff to endure horrific sexual abuse at only sixteen years.  
II. 
ARGUMENT 
In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court must take all allegations in the Amended 
Complaint as true and all inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff in determining whether 
Plaintiff stated a cause of action. Plaintiff has properly pled all elements of her claim pursuant to 
the CVA and all other applicable New York law.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss 
should be denied in its entirety. 
A. 
Legal Standard 
“In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations in the Amended 
Complaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiffs' favor. 
The Court's function on a motion to dismiss is ‘not to weigh the evidence that might be presented at a 
trial but merely to determine whether the complaint itself is legally sufficient.’ The Court should not 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 6 of 17

dismiss the Amended Complaint if the plaintiffs have stated ‘enough facts to state a claim to relief that 
is plausible on its face.’ ‘A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that 
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct 
alleged.’” I.B. Trading, Inc. v. Tripoint Glob. Equities, LLC, No. 17-CV-1962 (JGK), 2017 WL 
5485318, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2017) (internal citations omitted); see also Mills v. Polar Molecular 
Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1174 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 
12(b)(6), all factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and all inferences are drawn 
in favor of the pleader).  Furthermore, a complaint must only contain “sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 
U.S. 662, 663 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  A claim is 
facially plausible when “the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the 
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 
663 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). 
Here, Plaintiff has properly included allegations that are directly relevant to her claims of 
sexual battery as a minor child.  Collectively, Defendants engaged in trafficking and sexually 
abusing girls in their criminal enterprise, of which Plaintiff was a direct victim.  The facts alleged 
in the Amended Complaint demonstrate knowledge and motive of all Defendants and demonstrate 
that the Defendants were indeed an operating group of co-conspirators who had operated in concert 
as such for years.   
B. 
Count I of Plaintiff’s Complaint is not time barred nor is it duplicative of 
Count II. 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s first cause of action for battery is time barred and must be 
dismissed pursuant to the one year statute of limitations imposed for claims of battery and the three 
year statute of limitations for personal injury in New York. [DE 38] at 4; CPLR § 215(3); CPLR 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 7 of 17

§ 214(5).  However, pursuant to CPLR § 215(8)(a) “[w]henever it is shown that a criminal action 
against the same defendant has been commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from 
which a claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least one year from the 
termination of the criminal action as defined in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law in which 
to commence the civil action, notwithstanding that the time in which to commence such action has 
already expired or has less than a year remaining.”   
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York 
filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment against Jeffrey Epstein inclusive of One Count of Sex 
Trafficking Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part based on the criminal activities 
that Epstein committed against children at Defendant Nine East’s property.  [DE 3] at ¶ 28-35.  
“Minor victim VE was subjected to the types of illegal sexual acts detailed in the Criminal 
Indictment filed against Jeffrey Epstein by the Southern District of New York.”  Id. ¶ 45.  The 
criminal action against Jeffrey Epstein terminated on August 27, 2019. Consequently, in accord 
with New York law, Plaintiff has until August 27, 2020 to file any claim for battery or personal 
injury.   
Defendant’s next argument is that Plaintiff’s first battery claim is duplicative of her second 
battery claim.  That is not the case.  Plaintiff is permitted to plead alternative theories of recovery 
and has good reason to do so in this instance.  As Defendants are aware, the constitutionality of 
the CVA has been challenged in New York state court, a fact which counsel for Defendants has 
already addressed in open court in another related matter in this District.  While Plaintiff strongly 
believes that the constitutional challenge to the Act will fail, the challenge is being litigated 
nonetheless.  Consequently, it is possible, although highly unlikely, that prior to trial in this matter, 
the Act could be declared unconstitutional.  Should that occur, Plaintiff is entitled to proceed under 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 8 of 17

Count I of her Amended Complaint for battery, which is a long standing cause of action that is not 
time barred by New York law as explained above.   
Although Defendants make initial assertions that Count II of Plaintiff’s Amended 
Complaint should be dismissed to the extent it is based on occurrences after Plaintiff turned 18, 
Plaintiff does not claim that there were any such occurrences.  Therefore, by Defendants’ own 
admissions, Count II of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint is not being challenged and should not be 
dismissed.   
C. 
Plaintiff has adequately pled her negligence claims against the Corporate 
Defendants.  
“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 
662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation omitted). Plaintiff’s 
Amended Complaint clearly meets the basic pleading requirements from Twombly/Iqbal because 
every allegation she has pled is “plausible on its face.”  
Furthermore, Plaintiff has not engaged in group pleading. Plaintiff has thoroughly laid out 
a factual basis that applies to each of the respective Defendants. Each delineated cause of action 
specifies one particular Defendant and includes the specific factual basis for that Defendant to 
support the cause of action as is required under New York law. The language of the Amended 
Complaint is clear, each of the Defendants were negligent. “Prior to discovery, plaintiff need not 
explain the details of each defendant’s role in the planning, funding, and executing defendants' 
alleged joint [] scheme.” Hudak v. Berkley Grp., Inc., No. 3:13-CV-00089-WWE, 2014 WL 
354676, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 23, 2014); see also Tardibuono-Quigley v. HSBC Mortg. Corp. 
(USA), No. 15-CV-6940 (KMK), 2017 WL 1216925, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2017); c.f. 
Precision Assocs., Inc. v. Panalpina World Transp., (Holding) Ltd., No. CV-08-42 JG VVP, 2013 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 9 of 17

WL 6481195, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2013), report and recommendation adopted, No. 08-CV-
00042 JG VVP, 2014 WL 298594 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2014). 
Defendants further argue that Plaintiff fails to provide the specific identity of any person 
who acted on behalf of the Corporate Defendants; however, the Second Circuit has made clear that 
the Twombly plausibility standard, “does not prevent a plaintiff from ‘pleading facts alleged ‘upon 
information and belief’’ where the facts are peculiarly within the possession and control of the 
defendant,” Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Boykin v. 
KeyCorp, 521 F.3d 202, 215 (2d Cir.2008)).  Corporate Defendants contend that the Corporate 
Defendants cannot reasonably prepare a response to Plaintiff’s claims as a result of alleged group 
pleading; however, they fail to identify that each was engaged in a similar role in this sex 
trafficking enterprise.   
i. Plaintiff’s “negligent security” claim against Nine East (Count III) 
should not be dismissed.  
As stated by Defendants, to sufficiently allege a negligent security cause of action in New 
York, Plaintiff must allege facts establishing: 1) Nine East owed Plaintiff a duty, 2) Nine East 
breached that duty, and 3) the breach caused injury to Plaintiff. Sofia v. Esposito, 17-cv-1829, 2018 
U.S. Dist. Lexis 60947, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2018) (quoting Pasternack v. Lab Corp. of Am. 
Holdings, 807 F.3d 14, 19 (2d Cir. 2015)).  Plaintiff was recruited as part of a sex trafficking 
enterprise to provide a massage to Jeffrey Epstein at the mansion owned or controlled by 
Defendant Nine East.  ¶ 50.  “Plaintiff observed the opulence of the mansion owned by Defendant, 
Nine East, and the organization of Defendant, NES, Inc., which collectively facilitated her further 
cooperation with Jeffrey Epstein, culminating in New York Penal Law Section 130 crimes being 
committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein.  ¶ 63. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Nine East 
knew that when Jeffrey Epstein was in the home owned by Nine East, he had young females 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 10 of 17

including Plaintiff present. ¶ 91.  As the property owner, Defendant Nine East had a non-delegable 
duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition.  
Pursuant to basic New York law, the “nondelegable duty exception, is applicable where 
the party ‘is under a d[o]uty to keep premises safe.’” (Backiel v. Citibank, 299 A.D.2d 504, 505 
(quoting Rosenberg v. Equitable Life Assur. Socy. of U.S., 79 N.Y.2d at 668)); see also Brothers 
v. New York State Elec. & Gas Corp., 11 N.Y.3d 251, 257–258; Blatt v. L'Pogee, Inc., 112 A.D.3d 
at 869, 978 N.Y.S.2d 291). In such instances, the party “is vicariously liable for the fault of [others] 
because a legal duty is imposed on it which cannot be delegated.” Horowitz v. 763 Eastern 
Associates, LLC, 125 A.D.3d 808 (2015) (Rosenberg v. Equitable Life Assur. Socy. of U.S., 79 
N.Y.2d at 668) 
Defendant argues that the law does not impose a duty to control the conduct of third persons 
to prevent them from harming others.  [DE 38] at 6.  To the contrary, “[a] possessor of land who 
holds it open to the public * * * is subject to liability to members of the public while they are upon 
the land * * * for physical harm caused by the * * * intentionally harmful acts of third persons * * 
* and by the failure of the possessor to exercise reasonable care to (a) discover that such acts are 
being done or are likely to be done, or (b) give a warning adequate to enable the visitors to avoid 
the harm, or otherwise to protect them against it.”  Nallan v. Helmsley– Spear, Inc., 50 N.Y.2d 
507, 519; (Restatement, Torts 2d, s 344).  The “duty to take minimal protective measures arises 
when it can be shown that the possessor of the property “either knows or has reason to know from 
past experience ‘that there is a likelihood of conduct on the part of third persons * * * which is 
likely to endanger the safety of the visitor.’” Provenzano v. Roslyn Gardens Tenants Corp., 190 
A.D.2d 718 (1993) (citing Nallan, 50 N.Y.2d 507, 519 (quoting Restatement [Second] of Torts, § 
344)).  Plaintiff has specifically alleged that Defendant Nine East knew or should have known that 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 11 of 17

there was a likelihood of conduct on the part of Jeffrey Epstein which was likely to endanger the 
safety of Plaintiff along with numerous allegations regarding the prevalence of his conduct of 
which Defendant knew.  ¶ 24-44; 90-92; 97-98.  In fact, Plaintiff specifically alleges “[d]efendant 
knew or should have known of Jeffrey Epstein’s propensity for sexually abusing minor children, 
including regularly on the premises.”  ¶ 99; see also 100-101.  
Count III against Defendant Nine East should not be dismissed as Plaintiff has sufficiently 
pled a cause of action for negligent security.  
ii. Plaintiff’s negligence claim against FTC (Count IV) should not be 
dismissed.  
A necessary element of a cause of action alleging negligent retention or negligent 
supervision is that the “employer knew or should have known of the employee's propensity for the 
conduct which caused the injury.”  Ronessa H. v. City of New York, 101 A.D.3d 947, 948 (2012) 
(citing Bumpus v. New York City Tr. Auth., 47 A.D.3d 653, 654).  Plaintiff must also show the 
following to allege negligent supervision: 1) the tortfeasor and the defendant were in an employee-
employer relationship, 2) the employer knew or should have known of the employee’s propensity 
for the conduct which caused the injury prior to the injury’s occurrence, and 3) the tort was 
committed on the employer’s premises or with the employer’s chattles.  Krystal G. v. Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, 34 Misc. 3d 531, 537 (Sup. Ct. 2011).  Furthermore, an employer 
is required to answer in damages for the tort of an employee against a third party when the 
employer has either hired or retained the employee with knowledge of the employee's propensity 
for the sort of behavior which caused the injured party's harm.  Kirkman by Kirkman v. Astoria 
General Hosp., 204 A.D.2d 401 (1994) (citing Detone v. Bullit Courier Service, Inc., 140 A.D.2d 
278, 279, 528 N.Y.S.2d 575).  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 12 of 17

Defendant Financial Trust Company employed Jeffrey Epstein.  DE 3 at ¶ 106.  As his 
employer, the company had a duty to exercise reasonable care to refrain from retaining in its 
employ a person with known dangerous propensities in a position that would present a foreseeable 
risk of harm to others.  Id. ¶ at 107.  In fact, Plaintiff makes the following allegations, which clearly 
meet the Twombly plausibility standard: 
• Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to satisfy the personal needs of Jeffrey Epstein, 
which included daily massages which Epstein requires to be sexual in nature.   
• Jeffrey Epstein’s requirement that he receive regular massages from untrained young 
females caused Defendant and its employees to knowingly turn a blind eye to the dangerous 
sexual addictive propensities of Jeffrey Epstein, despite knowledge that he would cause 
harm to many young females including Plaintiff, in order to retain its most valuable 
employee—Jeffrey Epstein.  
• Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to further Jeffrey Epstein’s goal to obtain, 
recruit, and procure young females for the purposes of providing sexually explicit massages 
to Jeffrey Epstein.  
• During the course and scope of his employment for Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein did fulfill 
the corporate objective of receiving sexual massages procured for him by employees of 
Defendant.  
• Jeffrey Epstein was notorious for converting each massage into a sexually exploitive 
activity in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130, a fact which was known or 
should have been known in the exercise of reasonable care by Defendant.  
• Even though Defendant, Financial Trust, knew of Jeffrey Epstein’s propensity for the sort 
of behavior that caused Plaintiff’s harm and Jeffrey Epstein’s constant engagement in this 
type of criminal behavior during the course and scope of his employment, Defendant 
retained Jeffrey Epstein and failed to properly supervise him.  
• Jeffrey Epstein did not have a set work schedule or office but instead conducted business 
on behalf of the corporation from various locations all over the world.   
• While conducting said business, Jeffrey Epstein was frequently using corporate finances 
in furtherance of his sexually explicit behavior.   
• Upon information and belief, at times other employees of the Defendant corporation were 
coordinating these sexually explicit massages for Epstein to engage in during business 
hours, while he was within the course and scope of his employment for Defendant.  
• In fact, while Jeffrey Epstein was conducting business telephone calls or authorizing 
company actions on behalf of Defendant, Financial Trust, he would frequently be receiving 
a sexually explicit massage.   
• In certain circumstances, sexually explicit massages provided by young women, oftentimes 
minor children, who were untrained in the art of massage, were coordinated by another 
employee of Defendant who knew or should have known that the massage was being 
conducted by an underage girl for the exclusive purpose of committing sexual crimes 
against her.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 13 of 17

• Jeffrey Epstein engaged in this type of sexually abusive behavior on a daily basis to the 
extent that engaging in sexual massages became the most regular activity that he engaged 
in while in the course and scope of his employment.  
• Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual routine of recruiting and engaging in sexually explicit massages 
began many years before the formation of Defendant and was not a lifestyle unknown to 
Defendant, Financial Trust.  
• Defendant, Financial Trust, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known 
that Jeffrey Epstein was potentially dangerous, had engaged in a pattern of criminal sexual 
behavior against young females, including minors, for years prior to the formation of 
Defendant Financial Trust, and that he was not going to cease committing criminal sexual 
acts.   
• Jeffrey Epstein was retained with knowledge of the propensity of this sort of behavior.   
• Defendant, Financial Trust, retained Jeffrey Epstein with knowledge that he would in fact 
injure others, such as Plaintiff, during the course and scope of his employment. 
Id. at ¶ 108-123.  
As is clear from the aforementioned assertions, Plaintiff makes many allegations to 
substantiate her claims against Defendant Financial Trust.  Consequently, Count IV of Plaintiff’s 
Amended Complaint should not be dismissed.  
iii. Plaintiff’s negligence claim against NES (Count V) should not be 
dismissed.  
Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claims against NES should be dismissed seemingly 
in whole because they are based “upon information and belief.”  [DE 38] at 9.  However, the 
Second Circuit has made clear that the Twombly plausibility standard, “does not prevent a plaintiff 
from ‘pleading facts alleged ‘upon information and belief’’ where the facts are peculiarly within 
the possession and control of the defendant,” Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d 
Cir. 2010) (citing Boykin v. KeyCorp, 521 F.3d 202, 215 (2d Cir.2008)).  Given that Plaintiff was 
a sixteen year old child at the time that Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted her while being 
negligently supervised by Defendant NES, Defendant is clearly peculiarly within the possession 
and control of the facts relevant to this cause of action.  Notwithstanding, pursuant to Twombly, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 14 of 17

the plausibility of Defendant NES’s misconduct is clearly established by (among others) these 
allegations: 
• Upon arrival to the mansion, the two minor children were escorted inside by an employee 
of Defendant NES, LLC and taken to Jeffrey Epstein’s massage room. ¶ 52. 
• Plaintiff observed the opulence of the mansion owned by Defendant, Nine East, and the 
organization of Defendant, NES, Inc., which collectively facilitated her further cooperation 
with Jeffrey Epstein, culminating in New York Penal Law Section 130 crimes being 
committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein. ¶ 63. 
• It is believed that each employee of Defendant, NES, operated at the direction of Jeffrey 
Epstein.  ¶ 128. 
• Upon information and belief, the primary responsibility of each employee of Defendant, 
NES, LLC (“NES”) was to fulfill the needs or requests of Jeffrey Epstein; more 
particularly, his daily massage schedule. ¶ 129. 
• Upon information and belief, the employees of Defendant, NES, were compensated to 
primarily, if not exclusively, procure or maintain each young female masseuse, or to assist, 
knowingly or unknowingly, in the concealment of any misconduct committed against each 
masseuse. ¶ 130. 
• Upon information and belief, the employment responsibilities of the various employees of 
Defendant, NES, included but were not limited to: 1) recruiting young females, including 
minor children such as Plaintiff, to provide massages, 2) creating Jeffrey Epstein’s massage 
schedule, 3) maintaining Jeffrey Epstein’s massage schedule, 4) escorting various young 
females into the massage room at the New York mansion owned by Defendant Nine East, 
5) maintaining contact with the various young females who were recruited to the New York 
mansion for the purposes of providing Jeffrey Epstein with a massage, 6) providing 
compensation to each young masseuse upon the completion of her engagement with Jeffrey 
Epstein, 7) providing meals and food and other services to the young females in order to 
provide an air of legitimacy to the functions of the corporation, 8) providing hospitality 
services to the young females in order to provide an air of legitimacy to the functions of 
the corporation, 9) providing educational services, 10) providing medical services, 11) 
providing transportation services, 12) providing housing services, 13) providing various 
other enticements to ensure the continued cooperation of the various young female 
masseuse with Defendant NES’s corporate objective, 14) encouraging individuals, 
including the females who were recruited to the house to provide a massage to recruit other 
young females to engage in the same activity for Jeffrey Epstein, and 15) coordinating 
together and with Jeffrey Epstein to convey a powerful and legitimate enterprise system 
capable of gaining cooperation from young females recruited for massage, often minors 
such as Plaintiff.  ¶ 131. 
• In fulfilling their employment responsibilities, each employee voluntarily assumed a duty 
with respect to each young female recruited to massage Jeffrey Epstein, including Plaintiff. 
¶ 132. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 15 of 17

• To fulfill said duty, each employee was required to perform their assumed duty carefully 
without omitting to do what an ordinarily prudent person would do in accomplishing the 
task.  ¶ 133. 
• The young females being recruited to engage in massages for Jeffrey Epstein were 
inexperienced in the art of massage, a fact that was known or should have been known to 
Defendant NES and its employees in the exercise of reasonable care. ¶ 134. 
• Plaintiff relied on Defendant NES’s voluntary assumption of a duty as well as the voluntary 
assumption of each individual employee to act with reasonable care towards her.  ¶ 135. 
• In the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant and its employees further knew or should 
have known of the dangerous propensities of Jeffrey Epstein and the proximate harm that 
would be caused by his likely sexual misconduct and various violations of New York Penal 
Law Section 130. ¶ 136. 
• The failure of Defendant NES and each of its respective employees to act in the same 
manner as an ordinarily prudent person, placed Plaintiff in a more vulnerable position than 
if Defendant and its employees had not assumed the obligation to treat her with reasonable 
care.  ¶ 137. 
This brief snapshot of the facts as alleged in the Amended Complaint undeniably states a 
claim for relief that is “plausible on its face.”  Therefore, Count V of Plaintiff’s Amended 
Complaint should not be dismissed.  
D. 
Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages must be dismissed because they are 
precluded by NY EPTL § 11-3.2. 
Finally, Defendant contends that punitive damages are not permitted against any Defendant 
in this action. It is Plaintiff’s position that punitive damages are warranted against the Estate in 
this case where the Estate is domiciled in the United States Virgin Islands as a result of Mr. Epstein 
purposefully availing himself to the jurisdiction. In terms of the corporate Defendants, each 
corporation engaged in sex trafficking, which is exactly the type of act for which punitive damages 
are permitted. See, e.g., Doralee Estates, Inc. v. Cities Serv. Oil Co., 569 F.2d 716 (2d Cir. 1977).  
E. 
Should the Court find any aspect of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint to be 
deficient, she respectfully requests leave to amend.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 45     Filed 12/18/19     Page 16 of 17

Plaintiff believes that her current complaint amply sets forth a basis for proceeding without any 
further amendments. But, in any event, Plaintiff requests leave to Amend should the Court find any 
fatal deficiencies in her pleading. See Twahir v. Village Care of New York, Inc., 2011 WL 2893466, 
*1 (S.D.N.Y 2011) (“Leave to amend should be freely granted when justice requires.” … “[T]he 
standard for determining futility is comparable to the standard for deciding a motion to dismiss under 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).”) 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
For all the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in its 
entirety.

40918662v1
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Estate”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation (“Nine East”), Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. (“FTC”), and NES, LLC (“NES”, and together with Nine East and FTC, the 
“Corporate Defendants”; and the Corporate Defendants together with the Estate, the 
“Defendants”), through their undersigned counsel,  respectfully submit this Reply Memorandum 
of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff VE’s  (“Plaintiff”) First Amended 
Complaint1 (the “Amended Complaint”) (ECF Doc. # 3) 2  with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Plaintiff’s arguments in her Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion 
to Dismiss (“Opposition Brief”) are entirely circular and thus unconvincing.  Specifically, in her 
Opposition Brief, Plaintiff responds to Defendants’ arguments in support of their Motion to 
Dismiss the negligence claims against the Corporate Defendants by: (i) referring back to 
Plaintiff’s allegations comprised of labels and conclusions, formulaic recitations of the 
negligence causes of action, allegations made “upon information and belief,” and impermissible 
group pleading; and (ii) then stating, contrary to Twombly and Iqbal3 and Second Circuit 
decisions applying the former, that such allegations are enough to state claims.   Plaintiff has 
therefore failed to address the specific pleading deficiencies raised by Defendants.  
Plaintiff also inappropriately attempts in her Opposition Brief to restate – i.e., effectively 
amend – her allegations in her Amended Complaint.  Such assertions are not entitled to any 
weight on this Motion.  See Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 1998) (“a 
Plaintiff amended her Complaint before completing service on Defendants.  
A copy of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Bennet J. Moskowitz 
(ECF Doc. # 37) submitted with Defendants’ moving brief (ECF Doc. # 38).   
See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 - 556 (2007).

2002). 
Separately, Plaintiff’s reliance on CPLR § 215(8)(a), which is a narrow New York rule 
applicable only where – unlike here – civil and criminal actions arise from the same discrete 
events, is completely misplaced.  As explained in further detail below, the criminal indictment 
Plaintiff relies on clearly does not arise from the alleged 2001 sexual battery of Plaintiff.  
Plaintiff also fails to deny that her claim for punitive damages is barred under New York 
law.  Plaintiff’s argument that USVI law should apply to this issue is wrong.  New York law 
holds that the law of the place of the alleged torts – here, New York – applies to the issue of the 
availability of punitive damages.   
I.
ARGUMENT 
a.
Plaintiff fails to point to alleged facts supporting her recitations of elements 
of causes of action against the Corporate Defendants—there are none.  
As fully explained in Defendants’ Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to 
Dismiss (“Moving Brief”) (ECF #38), with numerous citations to Plaintiff’s Complaint, Plaintiff, 
among other things: (i) does not allege any facts establishing Nine East, FTC or NES owed her a 
duty, how those entities breached any such duty or how any such breach caused Plaintiff’s 
alleged damages; (ii) alleges her “friend,” not someone acting on behalf of any of the Corporate 
Defendants, caused Plaintiff to visit the real property owned by Nine East where the alleged torts 
occurred (Compl. ¶¶ 47, 51-61); (iii) alleges the “opulence of the mansion [owned by Nine 
East]… facilitated [Plaintiff’s] further cooperation with Decedent” (Id. ¶ 63), not that anyone 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 49     Filed 01/02/20     Page 7 of 16

-3- 
40918662v1
acting on the Corporate Defendants’ behalf caused such facilitation; (iv) alleges the sexual 
assaults occurred “during the course and scope of [Decedent’s] employment for [FTC]” (Compl. 
¶ 111) without asserting factual allegations as to how or why that was the case; (v) alleges the 
torts took place on Nine East’s property, not on any property owned by FTC or NES; however, 
Plaintiff does not allege any facts showing FTC knew or should have known Decedent’s 
propensity for the conduct that allegedly caused Plaintiff’s injuries; and (vi) engages in 
impermissible group pleading. 
In response, Plaintiff again recites the elements of her negligence causes of action, often 
without even citing to her own allegations (see, e.g., Opp. Br. p. 7 (“As the property owner, 
Defendant Nine East had a non-delegable duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe 
condition.”; p. 9 “As [Decedent’s] employer, [FTC] had a duty to exercise reasonable care to 
refrain from retaining in its employ a person with known dangerous propensities in a position 
that would present a foreseeable risk of harm to others.”).  Plaintiff misses the point.  Plaintiff 
failed to allege facts supporting these and other conclusory assertions. Moreover, Plaintiff’s 
claim that she “has not engaged in group pleading” (Opp. Br. p. 5) is clearly incorrect. (See, e.g., 
Compl. ¶¶ 23, 37-44, 62-63.)   
Plaintiff now argues, but fails to allege in her Complaint, that she is permitted to rely on 
her numerous allegations made “upon information and belief” because facts, which Plaintiff does 
not identify, are peculiarly within the Corporate Defendants’ possession (Opp. Br. [ECF #45] p. 
10).   Plaintiff’s new theory is unconvincing for at least two reasons. 
First, Plaintiff ignores the principle, cited in the Moving Brief, that “[n]o matter what the 
pleading standard is, her complaint must at least contain enough factual allegations that are not 
made upon information and belief to ‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level.’” Gilford 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 49     Filed 01/02/20     Page 8 of 16

40918662v1
v. NYS Office of Mental Health, No. 17-CV-8033 (JPO), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38450, at *14 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 11, 2019)  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  Plaintiff’s Complaint does not 
contain enough factual allegations not made “upon information and belief” to state claims 
against the Corporate Defendants.  
Second, Plaintiff’s reliance on Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 
2010), to support her new argument is misplaced. The Second Circuit recently reaffirmed that the 
principle set forth in Arista does not grant plaintiffs license to “merely plop ‘upon information 
and belief’ in front of a conclusory allegation and thereby render it non-conclusory.” Citizens 
United v. Schneiderman, 882 F.3d 374, 385  (2d Cir. 2018).  However, that is exactly what 
Plaintiff did in this action—she plopped “upon information and belief” in front of numerous 
conclusory allegations against the Corporate Defendants.  
Moreover, the principle set forth in Arista does not apply where, as here, a plaintiff fails 
to explain why facts not alleged in her complaint are “peculiarly within [Defendants’] 
possession.”  See Rothbein v. City of N.Y., No. 18-CV-5106 (VEC), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
32358, at *29-30 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2019) (court had “no basis from which to infer Plaintiff’s 
belief … is anything more ‘than pure speculation’” where plaintiff failed to explain why 
information not alleged in her complaint was peculiarly within defendants’ possession and 
control (quoting Ludwig's Drug Store, Inc. v. Forest City Enters., No. 13-CV-6045, 2016 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 28038, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 2016))).    
Plaintiff’s lists of allegations against FTC and NES (Opp. Br. pp. 9-10 and 11-12, 
respectively) merely repeat her allegations stated within Counts II and III of her Complaint.  
However, those allegations merely are a recitation of the elements of the asserted negligence 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 49     Filed 01/02/20     Page 9 of 16

40918662v1
causes of action.  Plaintiff ignores that she failed to allege in her Complaint any facts supporting 
these recitations.   
To the extent Plaintiff now suggests FTC is somehow vicariously liable for Decedent’s 
alleged sexual assaults of Plaintiff (Opp. Br. p. 7), Plaintiff is wrong as a matter of law.  An 
employer is not liable for an employee’s acts where the employee departs from her duties for 
solely personal motives unrelated to the furtherance of the employer’s business. See, e.g., N. X. v. 
Cabrini Med. Ctr., 97 N.Y.2d 247, 251 (2002) (“A sexual assault perpetrated by a hospital 
employee is not in furtherance of hospital business and is a clear departure from the scope of 
employment, having been committed for wholly personal motives” (citing Judith M. v. Sisters of 
Charity Hosp., 93 N.Y.2d 932, 693 N.Y.S.2d 67, 715 N.E.2d 95 (1999))).4
The issues in the cases cited by Plaintiff to support this new vicarious liability theory are 
factually and procedurally distinguishable from this matter and thus have no bearing here. See 
Horowitz v. 763 E. Assocs., LLC, 125 A.D.3d 808, 809 (1st Dept. 2015) (appeal from summary 
judgment order in action brought by plaintiff, who allegedly fell through glass panel at building, 
against building’s owner and manager); Rosenberg v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc’y, 79 N.Y.2d 
663, 666 (1992) (appeal from Appellate Division order on judgment upon verdict in wrongful 
death action arising from cardiac failure resulting from EKG ordered by defendant). 
The state court cases Plaintiff relies on to support her negligence claim against FTC are 
also factually and procedurally inapplicable, otherwise not germane to whether Plaintiff stated a 
claim under the federal pleading standards (she did not) or do not support of Plaintiff’s positions 
Plaintiff cites several slip and fall/defective condition cases in which employees and independent contractors sued 
their employers. See Backiel v. Citibank, N.A., 299 A.D.2d 504, 504 (1st Dept. 2002) (office cleaner slipped and fell 
after exiting  building owned by defendant); Brothers v. N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp., 11 N.Y.3d 251, 255 (2008) 
(construction worker injured on jobsite); Blatt v. L’Pogee, Inc., 112 A.D.3d 869, 869 (1st Dept. 2013) (salesperson 
allegedly tripped and fell on hazardous condition created by another salesperson). Such fact patters have nothing to 
do with the issues in this action in which Plaintiff alleges various corporate entities are somehow liable to her 
because Decedent allegedly sexually assaulted Plaintiff at Decedent’s residence.

on this Motion. See Ronessa H. v. City of N.Y., 101 A.D.3d 947 (2nd Dept. 2012) (Appellate 
Division reversed the Supreme Court’s denial of motion after trial and dismissed plaintiff’s 
negligent supervision claim); Bumpus v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 47 A.D.3d 653 (2nd Dept. 2008) 
(short form decision that provides no details concerning which of plaintiff’s allegations the court 
deemed sufficient to state a claim); Kirkman by Kirkman v. Astoria Gen. Hosp., 204 A.D.2d 401, 
402 (2d. Dept. 1994) (reaffirming the well-established legal principle, advocated by Defendants 
here, that “there is no vicarious liability on the part of the employer for torts committed by the 
employee solely for personal motives unrelated to the furtherance of the employers' business.” 
(citations omitted)); Krystal G. v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, 933 N.Y.S.2d 515, 523 
(Sup. Ct. Kings Cnty. 2011) (court found plaintiff stated negligent supervision claim because, 
unlike Plaintiff here, the former specifically alleged what a defendant pastor did that showed he 
knew or should have known of assistant pastor’s propensity to commit sexual abuse). 
Plaintiff’s assertions that Plaintiff “need not explain the details of each defendant’s role 
in the planning, funding and executing of defendants’ alleged joint [] scheme” (Opp. Br. 5),  and 
that “Defendant [sic] argues that the law does not impose a duty to control the conduct of third 
persons to prevent them from harming others” (Opp. Br. 7), are straw man arguments.  
Defendants are not making these arguments. Nor are these the relevant issues on this Motion.   
Rather, the issue here is whether Plaintiff has alleged “enough facts” to state plausible 
negligence claims against any of the Corporate Defendants.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.  Plaintiff 
has failed to do so.   
The cases Plaintiff cites to support these straw man arguments are factually and/or 
procedurally distinguishable and thus present irrelevant issues.5  Other case law on which

Plaintiff relies to salvage her negligence claims against the Corporate Defendants stands for 
uncontroversial principles not in dispute (e.g., what the pleadings standards are, which is not in 
dispute, versus whether Plaintiff satisfied the standards, which is disputed).6
b.
CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not revive Plaintiff’s battery claims that expired over 
a decade ago because the referenced criminal indictment did not arise from 
Decedent’s alleged battery of Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff argues in her Opposition Brief that, if the New York Child Victims Act is 
declared unconstitutional, Plaintiff should nevertheless be permitted to pursue her first of two 
duplicative battery claims because it would be timely under CPLR § 215(8)(a).  However, CPLR 
§ 215(8)(a) is not applicable to this lawsuit.  
CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides: 
Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant 
has been commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a 
claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least one 
year from the termination of the criminal action as defined in section 1.20 
of the criminal procedure law in which to commence the civil action, 
notwithstanding that the time in which to commence such action has 
already expired or has less than a year remaining. (emphasis added). 
Here, the subject criminal indictment of Decedent (the “Indictment”), which Plaintiff 
attaches to her Amended Complaint, was not commenced with respect to the battery of Plaintiff 
its alleged role in servicing plaintiff’s mortgage); Precision Assocs. v. Panalpina World Transp., (Holding) Ltd., No. 
CV-08-42 (JG) (VVP), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177023 (E.D.N.Y. Sep. 20, 2013), at *61 adopted by 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 10345 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2014) (finding complaint included “significant detail” establishing antitrust 
misconduct involved knowledge and participation of corporate families); Hudak v. Berkley Grp., Inc., No. 3:13-cv-
00089-WWE, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8168, at *10-11 (D. Conn. Jan. 23, 2014) (finding FRCP 8 did not prohibit 
plaintiff from collectively referring to multiple defendants in TCPA action alleging defendants engaged in 
robocalling); Nallan v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc., 50 N.Y.2d 507, 518 (1980) (plaintiff shot by unknown assailant at 
publicly accessible lobby of defendants’ building);  Provenzano v. Roslyn Gardens Tenants Corp., 190 A.D.2d 718, 
(2nd Dept. 1993) (Appellate Division reversed trial court order and dismissed vicarious liability claims against 
defendants).  
See, e.g., Opp. Br. pp. 3 (citing Iqbal;  Twombly; I.B. Trading, Inc. v. Tripoint Glob. Equities, LLC, No. 17-CV-
1962 (JGK), 2017 WL 5485318, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2017); and Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170,

alleged in her Amended Complaint.  Indeed, Plaintiff does not allege she was one of the victims 
referenced in the Indictment.   
Nor could Plaintiff credibly assert she was one of the victims referenced in the 
Indictment.  The Indictment describes acts and occurrences in 2002 – 2005 related to three 
specific victims.  Plaintiff alleges torts predating that period.   
Plaintiff’s reliance on her allegation that she “was subjected to the types of illegal sexual 
acts detailed in the [Indictment]” (Compl. ¶ 44 (emphasis added)) is unconvincing for at least 
two reasons. First, the statements in the Indictment showing it did not arise from Decedent’s 
alleged battery of Plaintiff, and not Plaintiff’s allegation characterizing the Indictment, are 
controlling.   
Second, even assuming Plaintiff’s allegation is true, it merely suggests that she was also 
victim of Decedent.  However, Plaintiff does not, either in this allegation or elsewhere in her 
Amended Complaint, claim she was a victim of the occurrences charged in the Indictment.   
New York courts have found that CPLR § 215(8)(a) was inapplicable in circumstances 
where the subject civil action had a much clearer and closer nexus to a criminal action than the 
relationship Plaintiff has attempted to create here between this action and the Indictment.  See 
Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 AD2d 595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (“Contrary to the arguments 
advanced by the plaintiff, [CPLR § 215(8)(a)] applies only to those claims which are based on 
the events of February 26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with 
the events of these two days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against the defendant”); 
Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. 
Oct. 23, 2018) (finding CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal 
action and those alleged in civil action occurred on different dates). Cf. McElligott v. City of 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 49     Filed 01/02/20     Page 13 of 16

N.Y., 15-cv-7107 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201829, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017) 
(finding CPLR § 215(8)(a) was inapplicable to claims against civil defendants who were not 
charged as co-defendants in criminal action brought against another civil defendant, 
notwithstanding the same events gave rise both actions). 
Gallina is especially instructive on this issue.  In Gallina, an individual sued an attorney 
for battery and other claims based on the core allegation that, over the course of two years, the 
attorney committed various acts of sexual misconduct against the plaintiff including sexual 
assault Id. at *1.  It was uncontested that defendant had also been criminally charged with 
forceable touching for other incidents that occurred with plaintiff in 2017. Id. at *3. The court 
dismissed as time barred plaintiff’s battery counts based on incidents alleged to have occurred in 
2016.  Id. at *2-3.    
The court rejected plaintiff’s argument that CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied to the 2016 
incidents, finding:  
… Plaintiff argues that these 2016 incidents are events or occurrences 
from which the “criminal action” commenced as to the February, March 
and May 2017 incidents arose within the meaning of CPLR §215(8)(a). In 
essence, Plaintiff argues that the July and October 2016 incidents are part 
of the same ongoing course of events as the February, March and May 
2017 incidents and should therefore be deemed timely commenced. 
As noted by Defendant, the case law does not support Plaintiff's 
interpretation of the tolling provision of CPLR §215(8)(a). The criminal 
instruments provided by Plaintiff in opposition to Defendant's motion 
demonstrate that Defendant was charged for incidents occurring on three 
(3) specific dates — February 17, 2017, March 24, 2017 and May 16, 
2017. Pursuant to CPLR §215(8)(a), tolling would apply only to claims 
based on these dates, "because it was only in connection with the events of 
these [three] days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against the 
defendant." Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 AD2d 595, 596 [2d Dept. 
1999]. As criminal charges were not commenced with respect to the July 
2016 and October 2016 events, the tolling provisions of CPLR §215(8) do 
not apply to the First, Second, Third and Fourth Causes of Action. 
Accordingly, those Causes of Action are time-barred.

40918662v1
Id. at *3-4.   
Here, Plaintiff asserts a much weaker connection between this action and the Indictment 
than the one unsuccessfully asserted by the plaintiff in Gallina.  Therefore, the Court should 
reject Plaintiff’s argument for the application of CPLR § 215(8)(a). 
c.
New York Law applies to Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages because she 
alleges the subject torts took place in New York. 
Plaintiff does not dispute that New York law bars her claim for punitive damages as a 
matter of law.  Instead, Plaintiff erroneously asserts that USVI law applies to this issue without 
citing any legal authority to support that argument.7
Plaintiff alleges the acts and omissions giving rise to her causes of action occurred in 
New York (Compl. ¶¶ 15, 22).  Therefore, New York law applies to the issue of punitive 
damages. See Starr Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., 14-cv-0463-JMF, 2015 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 60272, *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (“Because punitive damages are conduct-regulating, 
‘the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.’”) (quoting Deutsch v. 
Novartis Pharms. Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2010); Guidi v. Inter-Continental 
Hotels Corp., No. 95-CV-9006, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6390, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)).8
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing and the reasons set forth in Defendants’ Moving Brief, 
Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant their Motion to Dismiss in its entirety 
together with such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.   
Nor does Plaintiff argue USVI law permits punitive damages against a decedent tortfeasor.  
Plaintiff’s reliance on Doralee Estates, Inc. v. Cities Serv. Oil Co., 569 F.2d 716 (2d Cir. 1977), to support the 
assertion that sex trafficking “is exactly the type of act for which punitive damages are permitted” (Opp. Br. 12), is 
baseless.  Doralee has nothing to do with sex trafficking—it concerns an oil spill.  Nor does Doralee involve claims 
against a decedent tortfeasor.

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent the five Plaintiffs referenced above whose cases have all been assigned to Your Honor. While 
we agree with Defendants’ assertion that our discussions with the designers and administrator of the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program have been positive and productive, in our view, it remains important to 
every aspect of the process that our cases are not stayed and that they proceed accordingly.   
As we explained during the Case Management Conference that was held on November 21, 2019, our clients 
have varying views of the process, and while each will maintain an open mind about potential alternative 
resolution, those who have filed lawsuits do not wish to delay the expeditious litigation of their claims. 
We have and will continue to work with Mr. Moskowitz to ensure that we arrive at as many agreements as 
possible.  Consequently, we agree with the following discovery schedule as proposed in his report: Plaintiffs 
and the Estate will make initial disclosures by January 23, 2020; the Parties will exchange proposed 
discovery plans by January 30, 2020; and the Parties will jointly submit to Your Honor a proposed discovery 
plan by February 6, 2020.

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation, Financial Trust Company, 
Inc., NES, LLC, Florida Science Foundation, Inc., HBRK Associates, Inc., JEGE, Inc., Maple, 
Inc., and LSJ, LLC (together, “Defendants”; and Defendants together with Plaintiffs VE, Katlyn 
Doe, Priscilla Doe, Lisa Doe and Anastasia Doe, the “Parties”) in the referenced actions, as 
applicable.  We write on behalf of all Parties to report to the Court regarding settlement and to 
respectfully request that the Court approve the Parties’ discovery proposal.  
We understand that the vast majority of the plaintiffs in the above referenced and other actions 
against the Estate pending in this District will or are very likely to participate in the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”), with five plaintiffs having already voluntarily 
stayed their actions pending their participation in the Program.  Counsel for all such plaintiffs 
have conferred extensively with the Program designers and administrator, including in person, 
to, among other things, provide specific input on the draft Program protocol issued on 
December 13, 2019.  We understand such discussions have been positive and productive. 
The Parties propose the following schedule for discovery:  Plaintiffs and the Estate will make 
initial disclosures by January 23, 2020; the Parties will exchange proposed discovery plans by 
January 30, 2020; and the Parties will jointly submit to Your Honor a proposed discovery plan by 
February 6, 2020.

DEBRA FREEMAN, United States Magistrate Judge: 
The above-referenced cases - all brought by plaintiffs claiming that they were sexually 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein and seeking damages from his estate - have been neither consolidated 
for any purpose, nor designated as "related" by the Court. Nonetheless, these cases (together 
with certain other, similar cases, not listed above) have been referred to the undersigned for 
general pretrial supervision, so that discovery - and potentially settlement - may be coordinated 
as reasonable. While, at the parties' request, discovery in the other Jeffrey Epstein cases referred 
to this Court has been stayed pending a further report on the parties' settlement efforts, the 
parties to each of the above-referenced cases have requested, by submissions dated January 10, 
2020, that this Court set a discovery schedule. This Court's having reviewed the parties' 
submissions, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
1. 
In each of the above-referenced cases in which the parties have not yet submitted 
a jointly proposed discovery plan pursuant to Rule 26( t) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the parties are directed to submit a proposed discovery schedule for this Court's review no later 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 53     Filed 01/14/20     Page 2 of 2
than February 6, 2020. This submission should address all of the matters set out in Rule 26(t)(3), 
and should specifically include proposed deadlines for: 
a. 
service of initial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(l); 
b. 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories; 
c. 
any motion for joinder of other parties or amendment of the pleadings; 
d. 
completion of fact discovery; and 
e. 
expert disclosures and the completion of expert discovery, if any. 
. 
. 
2. 
As to each of the above-referenced cases, this Court will hold a pretrial 
conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on February 11, 2020, at 
10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 17 A at the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 
10007. The parties should be aware, however, that the mere fact that this Court will be holding a 
single, joint case-management conference does not necessarily mean that this Court will set an 
identical discovery schedule in each case. At the conference, counsel should be prepared to 
address whether there are reasons why these cases should be treated differently for scheduling 
purposes.

Within 14 days from the Court’s entry of the discovery schedule, Defendants will provide 
Plaintiff with a standard, proposed electronically stored information (“ESI”) protocol in order to

Within 14 days from the Court’s entry of the discovery schedule, Defendants will provide 
Plaintiff with a proposed protective order, with standard clawback provisions, to address any 
issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials. 
At this time, the Parties have no proposed changes to the limitations on discovery 
imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
With the exception of the protective order mentioned above, the Parties are not currently 
aware of any other orders that the Court should issue under Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b) 
and  (c).

THE CLERK:  VE v. Nine East 71st Street, et al, 
and other cases associated with this one. 
Counsel, please state your name for the record. 
MR. BENNET MOSKOWITZ:  Bennet Moskowitz.  I -- 
HONORABLE DEBRA C. FREEMAN (THE COURT):   Sure.  
Just one at a time.  Why don't we start on plaintiff's 
side, just one at a time? 
MR. JOSHUA SCHILLER:  Josh Schiller from Bois 
Schiller.

PROCEEDINGS 
Indyke and Richard Kahn. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right, so good morning. 
Of the many cases that have been referred to me 
for supervision, two have been stayed at the request of the 
parties.  All of you who are here today on these cases, 
they're not stayed.  We need to put discovery schedules in 
place.  I would like to get the latest, though, with 
respect to potential for settlement.  I've been hearing 
various and assorted rumors about the difficulties of 
trying to progress with settlement.  Can you give me a -- 
I'll turn to on defendants' side first -- tell me what the 
latest is? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  And do I recall correctly 
you prefer that we stand? 
THE COURT:  Sure.  Just if you're talking for 
some long period of time and you need to be looking at 
notes -- 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I prefer it. 
THE COURT:  -- I'll let you sit. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you.  And I appreciate the 
opportunity to explain what's going on in terms of 
potential resolutions of these actions and specifically 
with respect to the Epstein victims compensation program, 
which as the Court knows, is a completely voluntary 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 5 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
program. 
Well, a lot has certainly happened since the last 
time we were before your Honor back on November 21, 2019.  
What I'm pleased to report, before I get to some of the 
more difficult issues, is that the vast majority of 
plaintiffs here today, and, in fact, the vast majority of 
alleged victims of Mr. Epstein have, through their counsel, 
voiced unequivocal support for and intend to participate in 
the voluntary program, which is great.  And as your Honor 
just mentioned, though it's not even required and it was 
not something I asked, five plaintiffs, soon to be six, 
because of a proposed amendment, in one case plaintiffs 
have already voluntarily stayed their litigation in favor 
of their participation in the program.  Again, that's not 
something that's required but they saw the wisdom of doing 
that and conserving resources, which is something we 
welcome. 
The plaintiffs' support for the program followed 
the numerous discussions we had since we appeared before 
your Honor and you suggested everyone should be speaking 
and speaking often.  There were many discussions among 
myself and many attorneys in this room, as well as separate 
meetings between the claims program designers and 
administrators.  Again, that's Ken Feinberg is the 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 6 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
designer; Jordana Feldman is the designer and the sole 
administrator; and Camille Biros, who's also a designer.  
They met with, I understand, several times the various 
plaintiffs' counsel here today and other ones not here 
today.  And through all of these, you know, efforts over 
the past several months, we have a great showing of 
participation or intended participation in a program which 
has great promise of resolving many of these claims.  In 
fact, the protocol, which if your Honor may recall, that's 
the nuts and bolts of the program.  Plaintiffs' counsel has 
weighed in on that protocol.  The current draft reflects 
some of their input.  And that's all great. 
But here's the tricky part, if you will.  There is 
one reason, and only one reason, that the claims program 
hasn't commenced, and that is because the attorney general 
for the Virgin Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, who we 
firmly understand represents no victims -- zero -- has, for 
whatever reason that we don't understand, impeded the 
formal establishment of the program, against our wishes, 
and more strikingly, against the wishes of the plaintiffs' 
counsel in this room and other plaintiffs' counsel not here 
today.   
And if I can just -- and I'll try to do this 
succinctly as a matter of context of how we got to this 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 7 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
place where the attorney general has done this -- on 
November 14, 2019, the co-executors filed a motion in the 
probate court for the formal approval of the establishment 
of the claims program.  Of course, everything runs through 
the probate court.  The probate court has ultimate control 
and authority over all assets of the estate, and hence, we 
needed to seek formal approval.  We then had the conference 
with your Honor about a week later.  All of the good things 
that followed from that which I just went over, all the 
efforts that yielded the almost uniform support for the 
program among plaintiffs and alleged victims that I just 
described.   
Very regrettably, however, in the meantime and 
much more recently, long after everyone in this room was 
working very diligently to come together on the program, 
the attorney general for the Virgin Islands has again, for 
whatever reason, decided to impede the program.  So on 
January 15, which is by the way more than five months after 
Mr. Epstein died, the AG in the Virgin Islands publicly 
announced that earlier that day she filed a complaint 
against Mr. Epstein's estate and certain related entities 
under what is known as the Virgin Islands Criminally 
Influence and Corrupt Organization Act, which I understand 
is referred to as a CICO action.  So in the CICO action, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 8 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
very briefly, although it's very difficult to follow and 
far from clear, the USVI government appears to seek 
forfeiture of all assets in Mr. Epstein's estate even 
though he was never charged with, let alone convicted of, 
the underlying CICO allegations and notwithstanding that, 
with few exceptions, a lot of what's alleged has no nexus 
to the Virgin Islands.  Yet, the government comes in five 
months later and says, "We get everything."  And, again, 
they represent no victims. 
So we understand, from counsel admitted in the 
Virgin Islands, that this is without precedent in the 
Virgin Islands or elsewhere, for that matter, as far as we 
can determine.   
Shortly after filing the complaint, the attorney 
general for the Virgin Islands purported to issue liens 
against each of the defendants named in the CICO action, 
okay, including the estate, and even including -- and 
everything, by the way, everything within the estate, 
including the estate's operating account that it needs to 
function to pay lawyers, to pay house managers, people that 
mow the grass, to simply function.  The attorney general 
came in and said, "We have a priority lien over everyone 
and anything that exists, and everything is within the 
scope of these liens." 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 9 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
On January 23, to make matters worse, the attorney 
general sought to intervene in the probate proceedings to, 
among other things, oppose -- I mean, this is really 
amazing stuff -- oppose the establishment of the claims 
program that the victims are for, the alleged victims that 
have already spoken about, almost uniformly, for the 
establishment.  Unfortunately, most of what the attorney 
general said in the attorney general's various filings, 
including the motion to intervene, about the claims program 
was just simply wrong.  For example, the attorney general 
made a bunch of criticisms that would have only made sense 
if it was an involuntary program.  But it's voluntary, it's 
completely voluntary; no one is forced to do anything.   
On February 4, last week, I observed a hearing at 
which USVI counsel for the estate appeared and actually 
several attorneys in this room -- I'm sure they will speak 
for themselves -- were also in attendance at this hearing 
in the probate court.  And the hearing was on all pending 
motions to date, some of which, including the one for the 
establishment of the claims program, had been pending for 
quite some time, to say the least.  So this was, obviously, 
an important hearing.  The attorney general's motion to 
intervene, the assumption of the claims program, everything 
was heard last Tuesday.  Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Feldman 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 10 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
testified at the hearing to address the attorney general's 
various concerns, again, from my view, not speaking for Mr. 
Feinberg and Ms.  Feldman but just based on complete 
misunderstanding of what the program is and does.  The 
probate judge acknowledged very clearly -- I don't have the 
transcript yet -- and as soon as I get it, I respectfully 
request the opportunity to submit a copy to your Honor; I 
think it's very important for your Honor to see it directly 
as it bears directly on all these cases here and the 
prospect for settlement.  Getting back to the probate 
judge, she acknowledged that the estate wants the program 
to go forward, the alleged victims want the program to go 
forward, and that it would be much quicker, more cost 
effective than drawn-out litigation. 
The testimony of Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Feldman was 
also, from my viewpoint, well received and addressed just 
everything that the attorney general purported to be 
concerned with.  However, because of what the attorney 
general did with these liens, the probate judge asked the 
parties and voiced concern that the probate court's hands 
are effectively tied.   And thus, what the probate judge 
has done is asked the estate, asked the attorney general, 
anyone else who's interested, to brief that court on the 
effect of the liens. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 11 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
So as I appear here today, I don't know when the 
program will be established.  But time is, of course, of 
the essence.  If the AG does not very quickly remove all 
perceived impediments to the establishment of the program, 
we may miss the window for fulsome participation in the 
program.  This is something your Honor heard last time, 
that people wanted -- if there's going to be a program, 
they want it to move quickly.  Well, we were all here ready 
to go, and the AG had a different idea, I suppose. 
I do want to be clear, since I mentioned these 
liens, by the way, the estate's position is they're 
invalid.  We briefed some of this with the Court already, 
addressed it in court, in the probate court.  And that's 
something we will deal with, but in the meantime, like I 
said, time is of the essence with the program. 
I do want to address an entirely related but 
separate issue that the AG's actions have caused.  And this 
is also something we just don't understand.  You know, as I 
said, the AG has purported to put liens on everything in 
the estate, including the operating account.  Even if it's 
not the AG's intention, if she maintains those liens and 
says effectively, "Estate, you can't pay anyone.  You can't 
pay your attorneys," well, then, the co-executors have no 
way to litigate all of these cases that are here and in 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 12 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
other courts.  That came up at the February 4 hearing, and 
the Court denied, by the way, the AG's motion to intervene.  
It was procedurally improper.  And the Court specifically 
addressed the liens, acknowledging that they have potential 
disastrous effect if the AG contends that those liens 
should freeze all assets including those necessary for the 
estate to simply function, pay taxes, attorneys, whatever.  
Counsel for the AG on the record informed the Court that 
the AG did not intend for the liens to prohibit the co-
executors from paying the estate's administration expenses 
or to preserve its assets.   
Regrettably, right after that hearing, counsel for 
the co-executors received formal notification from the bank 
where the estate's operating account is, informing the co-
executors that, because of the lien, the bank has placed a 
hold on the estate's accounts.  And the AG, as we sit here 
a week later, after this representation in court by one of 
her attorneys, has not lifted the lien.  So very soon the 
estate's not going to be able to make payroll for people 
that help take care of the decedent's properties, attorneys 
will go unpaid, and everything is going to come to a 
screeching halt.  We hope that doesn't happen.  I can 
assure the Court I'm not for the inability of the estate to 
pay its counsel, but here we are.  And there are various 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 13 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
constitutional issues, of course:  How can someone be 
forced to defend actions when they can't pay their counsel?  
But, again, we hope the AG will remove these impediments 
and these actions won't need to be stayed; and, more 
importantly, the program will go forward.  USVI counsel for 
the estate is very diligently working to resolve these 
issues with the attorney general, but it's been very 
difficult.  And as I sit here today, this is the 
unfortunate mixed news that I have to report to your Honor 
about the claims program. 
And thank you, by the way, for giving me the time 
to address it. 
THE COURT:  Anyone on plaintiffs' side want to 
address anything that's just been said? 
MS. KAPLAN:  Yes, your Honor, briefly.  Roberta 
Kaplan.  Your Honor, there's no small degree of irony in 
what you just heard from my friend on the other side, given 
the fact that two days before he died, Mr. Epstein signed a 
will that specifically designated the Virgin Islands for 
the probate of his estate.  This is a problem of his will 
and his own making.  And the idea that they thought it was 
going to go well for them in the Virgin Islands and now it 
hasn't is somehow unexpected.  It was obviously quite 
deliberate that the Virgin Islands was chosen as the 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 14 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
jurisdiction. 
In terms of the settlement process and the 
procedures set up with Mr. Feinberg and others, we of 
course, as you've heard, want it to work out.  But one of 
the reasons for the attorney general's objections are the 
same reasons that we said to your Honor at the first 
hearing we had that it was done unilaterally, that there 
was no consultation.  The Court seems to be extremely 
concerned about the amount in fees being paid out of the 
estate to Mr. Feinberg and others.  Again, no 
consultation -- 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, the court, the probate 
court? 
MS. KAPLAN:  The court in the Virgin Islands -- 
THE COURT:  The probate court? 
MS. KAPLAN:  -- seems to be concerned about the 
amount that's being paid without any supervision.  On 
Friday there was an article in The New York Times, which 
I'm sure your Honor saw, about millions of dollars being 
run through a previously defunct bank that Mr. Epstein has 
set up.  There's no clarity, no diligence, no knowledge of 
anyone about any of this.  And while we certainly want the 
fund to go forward, we certainly want people to have that 
option, the concerns on the part of both the judge in the 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 15 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
Virgin Islands and the attorney general in the Virgin 
Islands are not unfounded. 
With respect to meetings with Mr. Feinberg, yes, 
we had those meetings.  Changes were recommended to the 
protocol based on those meetings.  I hadn't seen yet 
whether they were adopted.  I'm glad to hear from my friend 
on the other side that they were, but we have not received 
a copy of that.  One thing Mr. Feinberg did say at those 
meetings -- and I think it's very crucial -- we put this in 
our letter to your Honor -- it was absolutely his explicit 
requirement that in order for him to do what he was going 
to do, no plaintiff could be required or asked to stay the 
litigation in this court in order to proceed with the 
proceedings.  So that is an absolute explicit precondition 
of what he's doing, and there is no stay required or asked 
of any plaintiff proceeding in these cases.  And for those 
reasons -- and I'm sure we're going to talk about it today, 
given what you've heard -- 
THE COURT:  No stay required or asked for by 
defendants, is that what you're saying? 
MS. KAPLAN:  So that in order -- if a plaintiff 
wants to participate in the settlement process, the 
defendant can't ask them to stay their cases.  And staying 
the cases is not a precondition or a requirement -- 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 16 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  All right, plaintiffs can ask; and if 
plaintiffs ask, defendants can agree. 
MS. KAPLAN:  Of course, plaintiffs can always ask.  
If it's by mutual agreement of the parties, that can always 
happen. 
But I think that only highlights the importance of 
getting these cases moving, getting discovery moving, 
particularly with what you've heard from the other side, 
that there's no prediction at this point of when any 
settlement process can even begin.  And none of us, we're 
sitting here before on this side table, we have no idea how 
long these things will take in the Virgin Islands.  At 
least speaking for my client, we would prefer to have a 
judgment, given the uncertainty in this court, and we'd 
like to get moving. 
THE COURT:  Anyone else? 
MR. EDWARDS:  Brad Edwards, your Honor.  I'd only 
like to address a few points.  I was in the Virgin Islands 
last week.  And after the hearing, we went and personally 
met with the attorney general and explained what it was 
about the current setup of the protocol and the program 
that many of the victims liked.  And the attorney general 
specifically addressed some of the things about the program 
she did not like, most notably the fact that all three of 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 17 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
the administrators were chosen by the estate unilaterally.  
And the attorney general did not say the lien is for the 
purposes of taking everything into the Virgin Islands and 
to disenfranchise the victims.  What she has said and as of 
yesterday disseminated a letter to many of us -- I know to 
the estate counsel as well as to myself -- I think it's 
most appropriate probably to file it with your Honor so 
that you understand exactly where things stand with the 
attorney general's position as to the claims protocol.  She 
put in writing 13 what she called commitments that she 
wants from the estate in order to allow the claims program 
to -- a claims program to go forward.  Some of them are 
fairly minor; it looks like it could be worked out.  Some 
of them may be more difficult to work out.   
But the probate judge recognized that there was 
going to be this discrepancy; and until something is done 
with the attorney general's lien, the probate court simply 
can't allow any program to go forward.  So that court asked 
both the estate lawyers and the AG to continue working 
together with one another to reach a compromise and allow a 
program to go forward.  Like I said, we have very specific 
commitments that the AG wants in writing from the estate; 
and so long as those commitments are met, some of which are 
fairly minor, she is willing to allow -- to withdraw some 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 18 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
major portion of her lien to allow the program to begin. 
So I don't think it's as far apart as was 
represented earlier, but I do think it would help your 
Honor to have, you know, possession of the AG's recent 
letter that she circulated yesterday. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  This is Sigrid McCawley on behalf 
of Bois Schiller.  I just wanted to address the importance 
of because of the dynamic with what's happening with the 
estate and the AG, much of which is not within our 
control -- 
THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  Just move the mic 
a little closer for the sake of the recording of the 
conference. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course.  -- so much of which is 
not within our control, what's going to happen with the 
estate and the AG.  There's clearly a division there.  That 
just emphasizes the importance of this Court's power to 
move these cases forward.  It's really important to these 
victims to seek justice in this circumstance.  They want to 
move their cases forward.  Of course they're interested in 
the claims program, if that comes to fruition.  But at this 
point there's a lot that needs to go on before that can 
happen.  We're here to try to move our cases forward.  
We've put forth, we think, reasonable schedules to your 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 19 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
Honor that we'd like to move forward with as swiftly as 
possible. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I don't have much 
control over what happens in the Virgin Islands, as in 
none.   
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Can I briefly respond, your Honor? 
THE COURT:  Go ahead. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  You know, it's interesting.  I was 
in the Virgin Islands last week, Mr. Edwards was there, 
Mr. Schiller was there.  You heard a completely different 
tone with respect to the same, assuming Ms. Kaplan, that 
she's not included in this -- clearly, she had some issues 
with the program, that's fine.  That's her view of what's 
best for her client.  That's not for us to argue with. 
The same attorneys I just mentioned, excluding 
Ms. Kaplan, their Virgin Islands counsel stood up and 
unequivocally voiced that they want this program to go 
forward.  That's what they want.  We want it to go forward.  
I can assure you, speaking directly on behalf of the 
estate, that we have tried to discuss this with the 
attorney general.  At every attempt things become more 
difficult in terms of being able to see eye to eye.   
And I'd like to point out, in addition to the 
problem of attorneys not being paid and the estate coming 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 20 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
to a screeching halt, everyone in this room I trust 
recognizes that, according to the attorney general, her 
liens are number one.  You can get a judgment -- if you 
think you're going to get a judgment one day, you can try, 
and maybe you will, maybe you won't.  According to the 
attorney general, she goes first.  She represents no 
victims, but she goes first.  So it's not just some 
amorphous problem that's out there that's for me to deal 
with because Mr. Epstein's will is being probated there at 
his decision.  No, the attorney general's actions are 
problems for everyone in this room. 
THE COURT:  All right, again, I can't do anything 
about the attorney general in the Virgin Islands.  I can 
ask counsel to keep reporting back to me as to what's 
happening.  I'd appreciate that.  If you think the Court 
would benefit from seeing a transcript, seeing a letter, by 
all means file whatever you think is useful. 
I'm not going to worry right now about defendants 
not being able to represent themselves in these cases.  If 
that happens, it happens.  You have potentially some 
individuals who could represent themselves pro se if they 
wanted to.  It might be rather difficult.  Any corporate 
entities, of course, would be in default if defendants stop 
litigating the matter and don't have counsel paid for and 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 21 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
able to appear.  But we'll jump off that bridge when we get 
to it.  It seems to me that you're not there.  Hopefully 
you won't get there.  If you do, we'll have a whole, you 
know, slew of motion practice on defaults.  Let's assume 
that's not going to happen, at least for the moment. 
I do think I need to set discovery schedules. I'd 
like to get a feel for what the discovery would entail:  
what we're talking about in terms of volume of documents; 
what we're talking about in terms of number of witnesses on 
each side; what we're talking about in terms of experts, 
just to get a feel because understanding scope of potential 
discovery helps the Court understand what a reasonable 
schedule would be, as opposed to just saying this many 
months, that many months, understanding. 
In addition, you all have proposed deadlines for 
motions to amend.  I want to understand how likely it is 
that there'll be amendments, what you would need to know in 
order for there to be an amendment, because the amendment 
deadlines, which I realize are largely guided by the 
individual rules of a lot of the district judges here who 
have very tight proposed deadlines, the amendment deadlines 
that are being proposed would come up fairly quickly, and I 
don't know that plaintiffs would have any more information 
available to them than they have now.  Is there information 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 22 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
plaintiffs would need in discovery in order to determine 
whether they really need to amend, and what kind of 
information is that?  I'd just like to get an overall feel 
so I can do something sensible.  And as I said in my order, 
the schedules for these cases need not be identical.  But 
I'd like to understand what differences there are if we're 
going to have different schedules. 
Okay, so let me first get a feel for, on the 
amendment question, since that would be an early deadline.  
There's already one case where there's a proposed 
amendment.  There are some differently named defendants in 
these cases.  What are plaintiffs thinking in terms of 
whether there's a likelihood of amendment and what they 
would need to know, what they would need to learn in 
discovery, if anything, in order to determine if there 
should be an amendment?   
Anyone want to field that? 
MR. EDWARDS:  Sure.  I don't mind.  So we have 
sued not only the estate but several corporate entities.  
And we would at least need 30(b)(6) depositions from the 
corporate entities to learn what other related corporations 
performed certain similar acts that we've alleged against 
these corporate entities in their negligence of simply 
enabling Mr. Epstein's abuse.  I think that it would go a 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 23 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
long way to get a 30(b)(6) deposition of the estate, as 
well. 
THE COURT:  Could you do this by way of 
interrogatory? 
MR. EDWARDS:  We could.  We actually expected, 
especially given how long of extensions were given in order 
to -- or how much time passed before initial disclosures, 
we expected to get a lot of that information in initial 
disclosures in terms of what other witnesses were available 
and what other documents pertained to each one of our 
clients.  Instead, we got back that there are none. 
Now, I realize with initial disclosures the 
position being taken is there are no documents that we 
intend to produce to support our defenses, and we don't 
necessarily have to give you right now what you're asking 
for in terms of what's relevant to the claim.  So we're 
going to have to at least propound discovery.  I imagine if 
the current circumstance carries on in terms of what I feel 
is a lack of production, that we're going to get basically 
nothing, and then we're going to be left taking 30(b)(6) 
depositions, anyway, so that at least get a human being on 
the other side of the table to tell us what you know, what 
you don't know and why you don't know anything.  Because 
right now we're not being given any information, which just 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 24 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
is totally unreasonable, especially given the breadth of 
documents that we who have litigated these similar cases 
know exist out there. 
For instance, I would expect flight logs that have 
my clients on them to have been listed as some documents 
that would be used either as a defense or that could 
possibly be relevant to the claims.  Instead we're getting 
back there are no documents.  There are emails on 
Mr. Epstein's server.  Somebody has to be in possession or 
control of those emails, but the appearance that we're 
being given is that it's nobody. 
So if we continue down this course of having to 
kind of pry open every single fact and detail, it's going 
to take us a little while.  And that's why when we were 
negotiating a discovery schedule, I was asking for the 
amendment or the -- for the amendment of the complaint to 
be three months down the road for this exact point.  I need 
a lot of information, at least some information, in order 
to know what parties to add to this complaint or what 
causes of action need to be amended. 
THE COURT:  So a couple of you have -- actually 
for three of plaintiffs' counsel, Ms. Kaplan, Ms. Wang, and 
Edwards, I believe, you seem to have an agreement on a 
motion to amend deadline, which is not very far away.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 25 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
They're not identical, but they're in March.  What makes 
you think that makes sense? 
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, we don't anticipate any 
amendments in our case.  We perceive intent to go against 
the estate.  We don't think it's worth our client's time or 
money to be looking into other entities.  The estate has 
more than sufficient assets to satisfy any judgment here. 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MS. KAPLAN:  So in our case we're very differently 
positioned than Mr. Edwards, and 30 days is more than 
enough for us. 
MS. WANG:  And, your Honor, we take a slightly 
middle-road view -- Mariann Wang for three of the 
plaintiffs -- we put the standard date down that the 
district judges have marked on our cases has -- primarily 
because we don't anticipate amending; and if we do, it 
would be because we've really obtained new information that 
makes us think that actually the estate is not the right 
defendant.  So we don't really anticipate amending; 
otherwise, we would do it not by right or -- you know, we 
would just make a motion that some new information came 
out.  But we would anticipate as a general matter in terms 
of -- and maybe I'm jumping ahead -- in terms of number of 
witnesses on our side probably having about three to five, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 26 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
more like three, per plaintiffs' side, so a plaintiff and 
representatives of either therapists or medical providers 
or individual emotional-harm witness.  And then on the 
other side, I would anticipate doing very early 30(b)(6)s 
similarly to determine who if any is going to be put up or 
who we would want to put up on the defense side at trial, 
because right now we similarly are getting nothing out of 
initial disclosures or any kind of information from the 
estate about who is relevant for our clients' claims. 
THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  I threw out a lot 
of questions at once, so let's take them in pieces.  For 
plaintiffs deposing defendants -- well, for what 
plaintiffs need from defendants, documents, depositions, 
how voluminous are the demands that plaintiffs are 
planning to make on defendants, and how many witnesses are 
you looking for from defendants? 
MS. KAPLAN:  Again, your Honor, I think there's 
going to be -- you're going to see great variation, you 
know, which is what you see in the proposed schedules.  
I'm not sure we need a 30(b)(6) from the estate.  My 
client knows what happened; she knows who was responsible.  
I think maybe two witnesses on their side, both of whom I 
assume will plead the Fifth.  They're really non-parties, 
the two women who did scheduling for Mr. Epstein.  And 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 27 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
maybe three witnesses on our side, and that's the whole 
thing.  I -- 
THE COURT:  How about documents? 
MS. KAPLAN:  Any documents they have relating to 
our client, and that's it.  We're talking -- I mean, I 
find myself -- 
THE COURT:  You're looking for something much  
more streamlined? 
MS. KAPLAN:  Yeah, I find it very unusual for 
myself saying this, having spent 20 years as a partner of 
Paul Weiss, but this is not a case from our perspective 
that's going to take very much discovery or take very long 
to get to trial.  She'll take the stand and she'll testify 
about what happened.  We'll put on an expert.  There may 
be one or two corroborating witnesses.  And that's the 
whole thing. 
THE COURT:  And some of you are looking for a 
lot of documents, and you're talking about potentially a  
number of witnesses, right?  Who's looking for a lot of 
documents from defendants?  I've heard flight logs and 
emails. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  This is -- yeah, this is Sigrid 
McCawley from Bois Schiller.  I think "a lot of documents" 
may not be the correct characterization, but certainly we 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 28 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
put forth in our Rule 26 disclosures a good, substantial 
amount of information that we know exists based on the 
work that we've done over the last several years.  So 
we've already identified that as a body of documents 
that's relevant to the case.  But what we don't have, your 
Honor, is the information that we know exists from Jeffrey 
Epstein's electronic files.  For example, he had 
MindSpring accounts, he had house electronic accounts that 
he used to communicate with the employees, all of which he 
claimed the Fifth before he passed away.  So we have never 
obtained those in discovery unless it came from another 
individual who was copied on an email.  We know that he 
used other aliases for his email addresses, things of that 
nature, all of which is now accessible and that we want.  
So we are going to seek that in discovery.  It will be 
streamlined in the sense it will be responsive to our 
clients' claims and the claims that they have and the 
trafficking that was occurring with Jeffrey Epstein and 
his co-conspirators. 
Similarly, with respect to witnesses, we 
anticipate that we will call not only someone from the 
estate but a number of the co-conspirators that were 
involved.  We anticipate many of them will take the Fifth, 
as they have in the past.  And then on our side we will 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 29 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
have supportive witnesses, witnesses who saw our clients 
in the places that they say they were; obviously, our 
clients themselves to substantiate those claims; and a 
very limited number of experts. 
THE COURT:  When you say "a number of witnesses 
on defendants' side, some of whom would take the Fifth," 
what are you talking about by "a number"? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Just a couple.  I mean, really 
the, you know, the main -- in my view, the main people who 
were part of the operation.  So you have Sarah Kellen, who 
was copied on documents with my clients; Leslie Groff, as 
well, who was doing the scheduling, communicating between 
my clients and Jeffrey Epstein.  So individuals that we 
believe were facilitating this along with Jeffrey Epstein 
would be part of our case. 
THE COURT:  Any possibility for having multiple 
lawyers sit in on any particular depositions? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, we have five cases 
before you.  We're happy to coordinate with other 
plaintiffs' lawyers and have those, for example, if it's a 
30(b)(6), have those coordinated.  We would, of course, 
want an allocated amount of time to be able to take care 
of our cases, but we would coordinate that certainly to 
make sure that we're streamlining that process. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 30 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, one thing that may be 
helpful in that regard, Ms. Kellen and Groff, if we get an 
early -- if we can get an early indication, which we 
assume has to be the case if they're going to take the 
Fifth, those are the only two witnesses that I would even 
share with some of these other cases.  Then I don't -- you 
know, we may just be able to streamline that right out of 
the way. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, your Honor. 
Well, to go back to -- but I'll try to hit on 
what matters most.  First, this notion that we're somehow 
not -- we're stonewalling.  These were initial 
disclosures.  Mr. Edwards was correct when he said that 
the rule is very clear; the parties have to disclose 
things that they may use for their claims or defenses.  A 
lot of people kind of gloss past that and give short 
shrift to initial disclosures, but that's what they are so 
they can't sandbag people.  And it's hardly surprising 
that as an attorney for executors of an estate and not the 
alleged tort feasor himself, that after due diligence that 
we're all required to do as counsel with regard to initial 
disclosures for the most part, but it's not true as to 
every action -- but for the most part, I don't have such 
information or people to disclose at this time.  It's not 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 31 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
that unusual.  
I actually agree with a lot of what Ms. Kaplan 
said in terms of how she views the scope of discovery.  And 
that shows why the cases where people have a much broader 
scope, relatively speaking, should not proceed on the same 
track.  So in terms of the Bois Schiller cases -- because 
what we've done, and I'm sure your Honor appreciated this, 
is we were on the plaintiffs' side we negotiated discovery 
schedules with each set of plaintiffs' attorneys.  And we 
think it makes sense for there to be coordination in those 
actions for, say deposition.  I will say we are not in 
favor of people sharing discovery with each other across 
the cases.  We think that puts plaintiffs at an unfair 
advantage if something's disclosed because it pertains to 
person X's claims but doesn't pertain to person Y, person Y 
shouldn't get a free shot at discovery.  I'll just throw 
that out there for now because it came up.  
But in terms of the scope, yeah, the initial 
disclosures were actually quite -- 
THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  You would rather 
have one of your witnesses deposed multiple times rather 
than have one deposition where multiple lawyers sit in? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, it depends how long the 
deposition is, same what the scope is.  So related to that, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 32 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
the Bois Schiller firm has a much broader scope, according 
to their initial disclosures, of what they want here.  They 
listed dozens -- dozens -- of people and categories of 
documents:  movie stars, politicians.  That's fine.  If 
that's their disclosure, fine; but you don't get to proceed 
then, from our view, on the same track as someone like 
Ms. Kaplan, who says, "I'm not doing all that."  It just 
doesn't -- it doesn't seem reasonable to us for those kinds 
of different views to proceed on the same track.  And I 
don't see, to your Honor's question, how you can have a 
single tenable deposition of a representative of the estate 
when one person says these 20 categories are in the scope 
and another plaintiff's attorney says, "I just need to know 
about my client's allegations," which by the way -- and, 
again, I think Ms. Kaplan's view is the more reasonable 
one. 
And if I can -- I think it's related -- pardon me 
for just an extra moment.  You know, one of the other cases 
that I don't think lines up with the others and which you 
may have discerned a disagreement, there's relatively 
speaking, I think there is a lot of -- more agreement than 
disagreement in the proposed discovery schedules.  And one 
place where we don't see eye to eye with the Bois Schiller 
firm is that in the Annie Farmer case they sued defendant 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 33 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
Maxwell.  They've made a motion to approve alternate 
service.  I don't know what the status is.  I don't believe 
there's been an opposition yet.  I don't know if one's due 
yet.  But I don't see why that case should move forward at 
the same pace with discovery when, as they stated in their 
papers, it's inevitable in their mind that Maxwell will 
have to deal with this case.  So they're going to have 
another defendant who might have nothing to do with coming 
after things are already done and then want to do 
depositions and document requests.  We just said hey, why 
don't we build in some extra time, an extra 30 days of our 
proposal for that action, which I think is absolutely 
reasonable, given where they stand with serving Maxwell. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, just two things very 
briefly.  First on the characterization of our discovery, I 
want to be very clear we took our Rule 26 disclosure 
responsibilities very seriously, and we identified those 
individuals who witnessed the crime, were around at the 
time, would have information that's relevant -- directly 
relevant to those claims.  So they are fulsome in the sense 
that we took that obligation seriously, and we put that 
forth in our disclosures.  That's different than who we 
will necessarily call at trial, but we did comply with that 
obligation.  So he's talking about politicians and famous 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 34 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
people.  That is just the realm of what was going on in the 
circumstance, so if one of our clients came into contact 
with that person, they were listed on the Rule 26 
disclosures. 
With respect to Maxwell, our motion for 
alternative service is -- under the general reference order 
is before your Honor.  We have had that same issue in other 
cases.  In Judge Koeltl's case, similarly, she would not 
accept service, and we got the motion for alternative 
service granted there.  She has active counsel litigating 
in front of Judge Preska two weeks ago, fighting to not 
disclose documents.  This is not an individual who cannot 
be -- who is not found through her counsel.  While we can't 
physically find her right now, she is actively litigating 
in this courthouse.  And so what we've asked this Court to 
do is grant alternative service, which we think is 
abundantly reasonable, considering that we've served her in 
her email address, we've tried to go to the locations where 
we knew she had a residence, and we've approached her 
counsel, not only through email and phone, but also in 
person, and were denied the acceptance of service.  So we 
believe that, you know, this is not supposed to be a cat-
and-mouse chase; it's something where a defendant of this 
kind, through their counsel, should accept service.  And we 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 35 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
believe we've taken all the steps necessary to move that 
forward.  So we don't think that should be an impediment to 
moving discovery forward in our case. 
THE COURT:  All right. 
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, I forgot to mention one 
thing, and I should mention it.  The U.S. Attorney's Office 
of the Southern District is -- obviously is in possession 
of a lot of documents relevant to these claims, has been 
very cooperative and has told us all that there's a 
procedure where we can put in a form, and whatever 
documents they have, subject to grand jury secrecy 
requirements, will be produced in the cases.  I just wanted 
to give them those kudos. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Just as a side note, the 
two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of 
what's happening in the Virgin Islands, they may end up 
unstayed.  So I'm just going to address those separately 
since I don't have those counsel here today.  We may need 
to get them on -- I'll just tell defense counsel we may 
need to get them on a discovery track, as well. 
All right, so thank you, all, for background.  I 
have, I don't know how many cases at this point, 16, maybe, 
in front of me.   
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I counted 15, your Honor. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 36 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  Well, there's going to be 16 because 
the one that was just filed before Judge Koeltl -- 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Koeltl, okay.  Then that would 
be -- 
THE COURT:  -- I'm pretty sure that that's -- 
that was designated to Judge Moses; it will be redesignated 
to me.  And I'm fairly certain Judge Koeltl will refer for 
general pretrial supervision, so -- and I think I have 
local counsel, at least, right here just as an observer 
today.  So you might want to meet each other and talk about 
the case briefly. 
Of these cases, a number of them are pending 
before district judges who have preferences in their 
individual rules regarding timelines for discovery, which 
may not be the same as what I typically do.  Some of them 
do not.  Judge Gardephe has the most stringent 
requirements.  He generally likes fact discovery done in 
three months' time.  Judges, as I have reviewed it, Nathan, 
Castel, Failla, Engelmayer, Schofield, Liman, and Woods 
like fact discovery done within four months, 120 days.  And 
then there are a few judges who don't seem to have the 
individual preferences stated in their own scheduling 
orders that they like to put in place. 
Given that I guess the majority of the district 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 37 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
judges whose cases these are ultimately like to see fact 
discovery within no more than four months' time, 120 days, 
and that pretty much accords with the range that I would -- 
I might go a little longer in some cases if they're really 
complex, I might go five or six, but four or less is 
certainly fine with me.  It seems to me for starters I 
shouldn't go beyond the 120 days for fact discovery. 
Now, let me just say this about any discovery 
deadlines that I set.  A couple of things.  One, it is not 
uncommon for lawyers to ask for extensions.  Here is my 
general philosophy and approach with respect to requested 
discovery extensions.  If you've been making diligent 
efforts to get discovery done, if something outside your 
control holds it up, you know, you're looking for documents 
from a third party who's being recalcitrant, someone falls 
ill, you know, something happens that really is not a 
matter of the parties not trying hard and counsel not 
trying hard, I'm reasonably generous about extensions.  If 
it looks like you've been sitting on your hands, not really 
trying, then I'm less generous about extensions.  So if you 
ask for an extension, expect to show me why you need it, 
that there's some good reason for it. 
Settlement is another reason why it might make 
sense to extend the deadlines, even to stay deadlines, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 38 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
depending upon what's going on.  I don't want people to be 
wasting resources if cases are legitimately capable of 
being settled and if parties are seriously working on it 
and have some degree of optimism.  If it looks pointless, 
there's no reason to stay a case or put things on hold or 
extend out deadlines; but if things get on track and you 
really want to focus on that instead of spending the 
resources on discovery, especially if it's joint, you come 
to me together and say, "This is what we are doing," I will 
certainly take a good look at that and may well move your 
deadlines out to give you a window to try to get the case 
resolved.   
The other point I would make about discovery 
deadlines is especially when settlement is a possibility is 
that there is no magic about how discovery must be 
structured.  People tend to go in kind of a lockstep order.  
And it makes sense you want documents produced before 
depositions so you can put the documents in front of the 
witnesses at depositions; everyone understands that.  But 
there may be reasons why it makes sense to do something 
earlier and something else later, including the cost of it.  
If you're trying to save some resources and you think some 
particular discovery is more costly, you want to put it 
out, if an expert would be really useful for some reason, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 39 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
usually that starts out in the process.  Here I'm not sure 
how that works with this concept of a fund and claims.  But 
there's no absolute reason why you must go exactly in a 
certain order.  What we usually look for is are you all 
done by a certain point in time, not how did you get there. 
So if you want to modify interim deadlines among yourselves 
by stipulation, that's fine with me if the end comes in the 
same place.  So, for example, on a deadline for a motion to 
amend, if I set a deadline, again, most of these judges 
have or many of them have sample scheduling orders that 
have 30 days.  To me that doesn't make a huge amount of 
sense if there's really a potential for amendment because 
you at least, I would think, would need to serve initial 
document requests for interrogatories and get the responses 
back.  But if you want to by stipulation agree to move 
something -- and you can always request to move an interim 
deadline if you can't get them to step on it -- what I care 
about more is where the end date comes out, where you're 
all ready to move onto the next stage.   
So I'm going to start with that end date of 120 
days in most of the cases, and I'll hear about exceptions 
when there should be exceptions, and then talk about 
interim deadlines within that period.  That 120 days seems 
to have been agreed in Ms. Kaplan's case.  There seems to 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 40 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
have been different proposals set forward in Ms. Wang's 
cases.  Plaintiff was proposing June 10, which would be 
about that four-month period.  Defendants were saying 
instead of June 10, June 30.  I'm not sure I understand 
what the difference is realistically between June 10 and 
June 30.  It's 20 days different.  It doesn't seem to me to 
be huge at this point in the game.  Why are you not 
agreeing on June 10 there and saying June 30?  And in the 
case with Mr. Edwards, I've got June 30 as the agree date.  
Why did you kick it out beyond June 10? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  So for -- I agree that the 
days doesn't really matter as much with respect to that 
one deadline.  The difference with Ms. Wang that we had was 
kind of sequential over the whole period.  And one of the 
differences we had that then impacted going backwards was, 
you know -- and some of the district judges do have this; I 
don't understand it.  They insist -- Ms. Wang's firm 
insisted that expert reports coincide with the completion 
of fact discovery.  I don't get that.  You should finish 
discovery first and then, say, have 30 days for experts to 
then, based on all discovery, once it's completed, render 
initial reports and then have, in a case where it's not the 
most simple expert testimony, which this is not among 
those, in our view, have another 30 days for rebuttal 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 41 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
reports.  We had disagreement on that.  It kind of impacted 
everything from the start back to that point. 
MR. WINTER:  Just to be clear, we weren't saying 
that the expert discovery had to be finished by fact 
discovery; we were following the approach that the district 
judges had, which is fact discovery within four months, and 
then that ends also with the disclosures of the names of 
the experts, and then an additional period of time for the 
expert discovery. 
THE COURT:  No, both of your proposals -- just in 
your case, Ms. Wang, both your proposals have an expert 
discovery period following the close of fact discovery. 
MS. WANG:  Right. 
THE COURT:  You had June 10 and July 27.  You had 
June 30 and August 31. 
MS. WANG:  Yes. 
THE COURT:  So just starting with the June 10 and 
June 30 -- and I'll also note that the parties seem to have 
agreed with June 30 in the five cases that Mr. Edwards has.  
Why June 30 when you've got all these judges that are 
saying -- 
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, we proposed 120 days, 
and we're trying to bring to you an agreement.  I couldn't 
persuade counsel to agree to the 120 days.  I, like you, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 42 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
thought okay, 20 days is not the biggest deal, so to the 
extent that we can agree.  But we would much prefer 120 
days, and so -- 
THE COURT:  All right, look, unless we have a 
case with an exception, I'm going to go with the 120 days, 
which will take us to, I'm assuming June 10.  And so many 
people came up with that date, I'm assuming that is the 
120-day mark.  And, like I said, if you really need it, you 
can get an extension based on an actual need.   
Hold on for a minute on expert discovery -- we'll 
talk about that separately. 
The case where Ms. Maxwell has been named -- 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Annie Farmer, that's the -- 
THE COURT:  Right, right.  That case, that 
motion, is in front of me.  I've taken a quick look at it.  
I haven't taken a thorough look at it.  My initial reaction 
is I'll likely grant the motion.  I don't think it ought to 
hold up the discovery schedule.  If there really is certain 
discovery in that case where you are concerned that if an 
attorney for Ms. Maxwell shows up on the scene is going to 
want to redo a deposition, you should be talking in that 
particular case about a scheduling of a particular 
deposition or something so it doesn't have to be redone.  
All right.  But I don't think that that should alter the 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 43 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
basic time frame unless and until something happens that 
throws it off course. 
As I understand on that case -- and I don't really 
want to hear argument on that motion particularly -- but I 
gather you have made efforts to locate her and have been 
unable to do so? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  That's correct, your Honor.  We -- 
through investigation and also the other sources that we 
had of information of where she has been living. 
THE COURT:  Yes, I'm likely going to approve the 
alternate service, and I'll try to do that relatively soon.  
If I've had a problem with it, I will let counsel know; if 
I have a change of heart before I -- you're suddenly going 
(indiscernible). 
All right, so amendments, deadlines for 
amendments.  First of all, initial disclosures, if you've 
already done them, great.  If you haven't already done 
them, within two weeks of today would be, I think, sensible 
for everybody.  Does anybody have a problem with that? 
MR. EDWARDS:  No, your Honor. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  No, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  No.  All right.  So two weeks from 
today is what?  Today is what, February 11?  So February 25 
for initial disclosures.  Once you get in the initial 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 44 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
disclosures, which you already have in some cases, you 
should know what it is you need to ask for that you haven't 
already gotten.  So I want a deadline for getting out your 
initial document requests and your initial interrogatories.  
I will let you all go outside of Local Rule 33.3A -- is it 
A? -- with the three categories of interrogatories.  The 
first category of interrogatories, those really basic ones; 
and the second category, sort of what you ask throughout 
the rest of discovery; and the last category, the 
contention interrogatories, I'll let you skip the first 
category to have things move a little bit more efficiently.  
I really don't like those objections where you refuse to 
answer because it goes outside the local rule.  Because all  
one has to do is serve another set, and then you have to 
answer.  So it seems silly.   That ought to help speed you 
up a little bit.  That doesn't mean use interrogatories 
improperly.  Don't ask interrogatories that call for long, 
narrative responses; you know, be sensible.  But hopefully 
that will help the parties figure out if there is a 
potential amendment before the need for a 3(b)(6) witness, 
hopefully. 
So you get in your initial disclosures.  Some 
already have; others will have them by the 25th.  The 
deadlines for getting out your initial document requests 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 45 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
and interrogatories should be soon after that.  And, you 
know, a week after that would be March 3; two weeks after 
that would be March 10.  Is there any reason you can't get 
those out, just the requests for things? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's fine.  And I do have a 
question about that, your Honor.  Ms. Wang served us before 
we even submitted to your Honor a joint proposed discovery 
schedule with discovery requests.  I'm not going to rehash 
how we strongly found that to be improper.  What should the 
deadline be for those? 
THE COURT:  Right. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We agreed that, to avoid burdening 
your Honor, we agreed we'll -- 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.   
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  -- give it by February 28, but -- 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  Any issue -- if I set a 
deadline for the requests to go out, any problem with 
having those deemed to have been served as of that date? 
MS. WANG:  Well, your Honor, I just want to say we 
very carefully and thoroughly conducted a Rule 26(f) on 
January 8, and we then served discovery requests, which the 
rules allow for, on January 15.  We didn't say you have to 
respond in 30 days.  We came to an agreement with them that 
they would respond by February 28.  So I don't see why we 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 46 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
can't stick to the agreement.   
We're also going to get document requests from 
them and respond as quickly as possible.  They've agreed 
that they would respond by the 28th, by February 28th, so I 
don't see -- 
THE COURT:  No problem with that? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's fine, but I do want to 
correct.  Yes, they did say 30 days.  And I'm happy to 
share all correspondence with your Honor where we said, 
well, we need more time.  And we thought -- and I can ask 
the Court now -- that it stood to reason that, since your 
Honor had said that one of the things that should be 
negotiated between counsel and then addressed with the 
Court were initial service of discovery requests -- that 
was in your order -- that it didn't make sense to us that 
you could already serve requests and it was improper.  So I 
would like the additional time, actually. 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  If you've already agreed 
that you can respond to these things by February 28, is 
there some reason you cannot? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  It's very burdensome.  It can be 
done.  If we had a little more time, it would be better. 
THE COURT:  Is it burdensome to the extent that 
you feel you need to negotiate the scope, in which case you 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 47 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
should be conferring in good faith to negotiate the scope? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We will do so.  That is part of 
the problem. 
THE COURT:  Well, respond to the extent you're 
able to do so by the 28th, since you've already agreed to 
that.  I'm not going to undo that agreement.  And in 
general, if you have -- what do I have here on these 
different proposals?  Let me set them out next to each 
other.  You have March 12 for the most part; you're 
agreeing to serve by March 12, is that right?  Am I reading 
this right, counsel? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I'm sorry, I don't know what your 
Honor's looking at. 
THE COURT:  Requests -- I'm sorry -- a deadline 
for service of initial document requests and 
interrogatories.  You gave me different variations of 
proposals.  I'm trying to summarize them and put them next 
to each other.  Am I looking at the right date, that you 
were agreeing to do that by March 12? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  With -- I trust you mean in 
Ms. Wang's actions? 
THE COURT:  No. 
MS. WANG:  No. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's my confusion. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 48 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
MS. WANG:  I don't believe for most of our judges 
we only needed to put in a discovery deadline.  And then, 
as your Honor advised, we can sort of work throughout 
within those four months how things are done.  But I don't 
believe there's a deadline for that, but -- (Stopped 
talking.) 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley 
again.  Our five, we did have for the initial 
interrogatories and document requests, the March 12 date.  
And then they had proposed -- they didn't agree with that 
one because 60 days from the entry. 
THE COURT:  I thought a few of you had proposed 
March 12. 
MS. KAPLAN:  Yes, we had proposed 30 days from 
entry of the order, as well, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Which would be March 12? 
MS. KAPLAN:  If I'm looking at the date correctly, 
yes. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So, look, here's what makes 
sense to me.  You get your initial disclosures done.  If 
you've already done them, great; if not, by two weeks.  Two 
weeks is February 25.  At most, the initial requests should 
go out within two weeks after you get back -- after you get 
in the initial disclosures.  You see what you've got, you 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 49 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
figure out what else you need, you serve your requests.  If 
you can do it sooner, that would be great.  If you can do 
it within a week of that, that's March 3.  If you need two 
weeks, March 10.  I'll go with March 10, since a lot of you 
are proposing March 12.  So March 10 for service of initial 
document requests and interrogatories.  If you have already 
agreed to something, in one case perhaps or in a series of 
cases -- I'm not sure -- where the requests were served 
already and you've negotiated a time to respond, live with 
that.  If you have issues that come up along the way, 
you'll raise them.  So if you get them out by March 12 -- 
I'm sorry -- by March 10, you're going to get in responses 
to those hopefully by April 9. 
Now, here's the thing:  the motion to amend 
deadline.  You're getting in those responses by April 9.  
It doesn't make sense to me to have a motion to amend 
deadline of a month earlier than that.  It just doesn't 
really make sense.  So I am -- and here's another thing 
about that.  If there's a motion to amend -- I'm sorry -- 
if there's a proposed amendment and your adversary isn't 
going to fight it, isn't going to oppose it if you make a 
motion, I'm not going to require you to make the motion.  
It's silly.  There's not going to be an opposition.  So if 
you think you have a potential amendment, draft it up, send 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 50 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
it to your adversary saying, "Would you oppose it?"  If the 
answer is, "No, I wouldn't oppose it," just let me know 
there would not be an opposition.  It's not the same thing 
as consenting; it's just not opposing.  If there's not 
going to be an opposition, I'll just take it for filing; I 
will not require a motion.  If there is going to be an 
opposition, then I need a motion for leave to amend. 
So the deadline I want to set is for motions.  So 
you have to back it up in your head and think, I have to 
draft it, send it to my adversary, give him a chance to let 
me know if he's objecting or not; if there is an objection, 
I've got to draft up a motion.  So if you're getting in the 
responses to the initial document requests and 
interrogatories in the middle of April and you need time to 
figure out if there is an amendment, logically, end of 
April makes sense for motions to amend.  I'd be inclined to 
set April 30 for that deadline.  Anybody have a problem 
with that? 
MR. EDWARDS:  No, your Honor. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  All right, April 30.  And the reason 
why I'm doing it and not sticking with the earlier date is 
because I know we have at least one amendment in one case.  
I'm seeing different names of different defendants in these 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 51 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
cases.  I think there is a possibility in at least some of 
the cases.  If there's not going to be an amendment, fine; 
the date comes, the date goes, there's no amendment.   
If you need more time to figure out if there is an 
amendment, put your hand in the air before that date comes 
and ask for it to be extended.  That deadline in 
particular, of all the deadlines in a case scheduling 
order, can come back and bite you because under Rule 15, 
amendments are very freely granted in the court.  But under 
Rule 16, if you miss a deadline in a scheduling order, you 
have to show good cause why you couldn't have met the 
deadline.  So if you miss a deadline for a motion to amend, 
you're not in Rule 15 land anymore, you are in Rule 16 land 
first.  If you can't show good cause, that leave to amend 
is freely given standard can go out the window.  All right?  
So if something comes up that you really could not have 
anticipated, some new name of some new person or new entity 
you couldn't have known about comes up late, you'll have 
good cause and you'll be able to meet a Rule 16 standard.  
But if it's something where it's right there in the 
document staring you in the face earlier, someone might say 
hey, you could have anticipated that sooner, you may be 
stuck under Rule 16 not being able to show good cause for a 
late amendment.  So if you really think you might need to 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 52 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
amend and you really are worried about that deadline, say 
something before it runs, don't wait until later because 
you may end up being caught.  All right?  It's another 
reason to move it out a little bit further so we try to 
avoid those issues. 
All right, close of fact discovery, June 10.  I'll 
deal with any exceptions, if you think your case has some 
extraordinary reason why these shouldn't be the deadlines, 
separately.  But for the most part, June 10.    
And expert discovery, what kind of experts are we 
talking about here?  On plaintiffs' side, what kind of 
experts? 
MS. WANG:  For my plaintiffs, it would be 
emotional harm, mental health experts. 
THE COURT:  All right, anyone else have any other 
sort of experts in mind? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  And that's the same for us, as 
well. 
THE COURT:  And how about defendants' side, what 
kind of experts do you think you might -- 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  It would be rebuttal experts, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So are you confident that you 
would have such experts; it's just a matter of waiting to 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 53 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
see what plaintiffs' experts say?  So, in other words, 
okay, you would want to have examinations done? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, correct. 
THE COURT:  Do you want for the examinations to 
have the plaintiffs' reports in hand before the 
examinations are done? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's exactly right, your Honor, 
to understand specifically.  I mean, one of the issues 
we're having, discovery hasn't started yet in earnest, so 
it's not something to fully address now, but is a lack of 
understanding of what are the alleged damages, in which 
category, which is, unfortunately, a sneak preview, 
something that I don't see eye to eye with, the 
completeness of initial disclosures in that regard on 
plaintiffs' side.  So to answer your question, yes, for 
those reasons and others, I would like to see the expert 
reports first and have an opportunity to do a full 
rebuttal. 
THE COURT:  All right, and on plaintiffs' side, 
this doesn't sound like the kind of expert that would need 
fully discovery before you can have your clients examined 
and have a report about emotional distress, is that right? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  That's correct. 
MR. EDWARDS:  I think that's right, your Honor. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 54 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  Because usually, in most cases I 
would say get the fact discovery done, and then 30 days 
after the close of fact discovery, have an expert report.  
That's not really what's needed here? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  No. 
MS. KAPLAN:  That's correct, your Honor. 
MS. WANG:  That's correct. 
THE COURT:  Is there any case represented by any 
plaintiffs' counsel where you don't think you could get out 
the expert report the same time the fact discovery is done? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  I think that's fine. 
THE COURT:  Does anyone think that's going to be 
a problem, to get it done by June 1?  Then I can have 
defendants 30 days after that, and we're not too slowed 
down. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Okay. 
THE COURT:  Yes? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Right. 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  June 10 for plaintiffs' expert 
reports.  Thirty days thereafter would take us to July 10.  
The good thing about this schedule is you don't end up with 
experts in August.  Having experts in August is almost a 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 55 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
guarantee of falling behind on a schedule.  So July 10 for 
rebuttal experts.  End of July to get these people deposed 
if they're going to be deposed.  July 31?  Close of all 
discovery, July 31. 
I would not be surprised if some of these dates 
move, but that's not an invitation to go slowly.  The only 
invitation to go slowly is if the settlement process heats 
up, and then I expect you to let me know about that and 
that it's realistic and that there's, you know, agreement 
on the need to slow down the cases to try to get the 
settlement process moving.  But, other than that, if that's 
still stalled, I don't see any reason why we can't stick to 
a schedule like this. 
Now, on cases where there's any other 
extraordinary circumstances, I already addressed the one 
with the additional defendant who hasn't been served.  
Other than the scope of discovery requests, is there any 
reason why in any of these defendants or anybody else 
thinks there should be a different schedule? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  With respect to the scope of 
discovery, I anticipate some discovery disputes.  Again, 
it's not an invitation; I just expect that they will come 
along.  I enforce the good-faith conference requirement.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 56 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
By that I mean you have to really talk to each other, and 
you have to really see if you can resolve your discovery 
disputes or at least narrow them before you bring them to 
my attention.  That doesn't mean you send somebody an 
email and you don't get a response right away.  It means 
you pick up the phone, you talk to each other, you work 
through them.  Right?  Pet peeve -- don't have this 
happen -- I get a letter, motion to compel, all this 
detail; I get an opposition, all this detail; I get a 
reply saying in light of what's said in opposition, never 
mind on some of these issues.  I've wasted my time, you've 
wasted your time.  That just tells me there's a failure of 
good-faith conferences.  So, really, on any discovery 
requests, have that conversation.  What's the heart of 
what you're really looking for?  How can we get you that 
without undue burden?  How can we prioritize?  Can we get 
you this first and can we produce the rest on a rolling 
basis?  Here's why this is a burden.  Here are some ideas 
to ways to, you know, alleviate that burden. 
With respect to ESI, you have been -- I'm not sure 
if I've seen things come across my desk or not.  You've 
been talking about protocols? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We've been negotiating with, 
again, each group of plaintiffs' counsel, protective order, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 57 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
and have agreed that it makes sense to have a standard ESI 
protocol.  And that -- I believe we're in agreement that 
there should be a standard Clawback Provision in the 
protective order.  So as I sit here now, I don't foresee an 
inability to come to agreement on those issues. 
Don't know how many email accounts you've got 
access to? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yeah, it's -- among the many 
discussions that counsel need to have with each other are 
what they think needs to be searched, why, etc.  So to 
answer your question, I don't know how many there are that 
matter, if any. 
THE COURT:  Well, if it was something in Jeffrey 
Epstein's control, presumably it needs to be searched, and 
you're going to have to figure out how to get access. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Correct. 
THE COURT:  But if you've got other individuals, 
if they're named defendants and they have email accounts or 
other social media accounts -- 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I only represent the co-executors 
of the estate related to the alleged torts.  I mean, we've 
heard a lot about these other people who are out there, 
just to be clear for -- 
THE COURT:  There are some other defendants named 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 58 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
in some of these papers -- 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, there are entities in 
Mr. Edwards'.  And what I -- to my knowledge -- and I'm 
still looking into it -- I don't think that that changes 
the landscape in those actions in terms of what emails are 
potentially subject to review. 
THE COURT:  But you're representing these 
entities? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, correct.  They're all part of 
the estate. 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I was speaking more about -- you 
know, there's been discussion about the addition of 
Maxwell, Kellen and others -- 
THE COURT:  No, I wasn't assuming you were 
representing that person.  Okay. 
MS. KAPLAN:  Judge Freeman -- 
THE COURT:  Yes. 
MS. KAPLAN:  -- one thing that may be helpful -- 
and we've encountered this issue in my Charlottesville 
litigation recently -- is it would be helpful to know from 
the estate whether there are any email accounts or other 
accounts that Mr. Epstein was -- were in his name that they 
do not have passwords to.  In other words, do they actually 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 59 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
have access to be able to search all the email accounts 
that he had, any social media accounts, texts, etc. 
THE COURT:  It's a conference issue first. 
MS. KAPLAN:  Okay. 
THE COURT:  I mean, look, ESI is a subject you 
should be having conversation on.  You don't want to have 
requests, be responding in a limited way, have plaintiffs' 
counsel surprised at the way in which you're responding, 
have them jump up and down and say there were a million 
other accounts that should have been searched.  You know, 
if you see something you anticipate you're not going to be 
able to do everything that's being asked for, well, you 
should be having conversation.  If you know of certain 
accounts and you're concerned there may not be passwords, 
you should be having conversations, try to talk about 
those issues.  If you run into a discovery issue, you have 
conferred fully in good faith, you can't work it out, 
whoever's got the issue, put a letter on ECF and tell me 
what the issue is.  I'll wait for a response.  If I can 
resolve it on paper, I will.  I might just do a text order 
or something if it's easy.  Or I'll set up a conference to 
deal with that issue.  These issues might start varying 
case by case; they might not.  If I'm seeing issues across 
the board or in a number of cases, we'll do something like 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 60 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
this.   
If I'm seeing a discrete issue in a particular 
case, I might have a conference just in that case to deal 
with it, if I need to.  I'm hoping that you are going to 
be able to confer.  You've been able to confer about other 
things so far.  I'm hoping you'll be able to confer on 
discovery disputes and get them at least as narrow as 
possible.  If you really are stuck on something, don't 
send me one of these letters that's all, you know, waving 
your arms around in general terms.  If there's a 
particular request where you think the response is 
inadequate, one side or the other, tell me what the 
request is, tell me what the response was, tell me what 
your discussion has been, tell me where you're stuck; you 
know, let me look at it, let me understand each side's 
position.  Joint letters on discovery are always welcome 
that lay out here's the dispute, here's each side's 
position.  A million letters back and forth and back and 
forth and back and forth endlessly is not welcome.  All 
right.  One letter, one response is fine.  Joint letters 
are great.  You know, suddenly being overwhelmed with, you 
know, 20 letters on one dispute is unnecessary, and I hope 
you will avoid that kind of approach. 
Is it useful to set -- this is a rhetorical 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 61 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
question -- of course, it's useful -- to set a follow-up 
date for a report on how it's going, both with respect to 
settlement and with respect to discovery, just to give me 
an idea of how it's going?  Yes, I think so.  So the 
question is what's the right touch-base point? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, in terms of the claims 
program issues, I think the next 30 days are going to have 
a lot of movement one way or the other.  I don't 
necessarily know that that's the case with discovery. 
THE COURT:  Well, when there is a meaningful 
development, I think a report would be in order.  So if 
something -- I don't mean every single development, but 
something really significant as in "we're back on track" 
or, you know, "we can't litigate this case anymore because 
the lawyers are not being funded," something significant, 
regardless of any date I set, let me know. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Okay. 
THE COURT:  Otherwise, maybe we gear it to when 
you're expecting to get responses in on the written 
discovery requests, just to see how things are looking at 
that point, maybe you have a little better idea. 
With respect to deposition -- by the way, what 
was that date?  That was -- that was right, middle of 
April.  Why don't we say end of April?  If nothing else, I 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 62 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
get status reports.  I'd welcome clusters of them.   
Whatever makes the most sense.  April 30 for status 
reports, written status reports.  Joint would be nice.  In 
fact, why don't I just say that?  Joint status reports in 
these different cases. 
MS. KAPLAN:  When you say "joint," your Honor, 
you mean plaintiff and defendant? 
THE COURT:  Plaintiff and defendant, right.  So 
you can have -- if you have five cases on plaintiffs' one 
counsel, you can send me one and so it's spread across 
five cases.  If you can do a joint one with all the 
lawyers, that's lovely, but that -- you know, I don't want 
to make things impossible for you.  But at least joint 
with defendant.  The way you did the joint reports on 
settlement was fine.  I had four of them or something.  
That's fine. 
What was I going to say?  I do not remember what 
I was going to say.  What was I going to say?  Was I 
start -- my clerk tells me I was starting to talk about 
depositions.  I don't know what I was going to say.  Oh, I 
do.  So one reason why discovery schedules get extended is 
people don't plan early enough for what's coming later.  
So if you know who needs to be deposed, you can start 
talking about it.  You can open your calendars, you can 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 63 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
start talking about availability of witnesses.  You can 
sketch out a plan how you're going to get these things 
done by June 10.   
So it sounds like May will be a month when 
you'll be involved in depositions.  Figure out sooner 
rather than later what witnesses' availability would be 
for May.  With respect to someone like a 30(b)(6) witness 
where it may make sense to have one deposition attended by 
multiple counsel, talk about that sort of thing.  That 
won't be a one-day deposition; you've got too many lawyers 
who want to ask questions.  How many days it should be, 
how that should be structured, talk about it; see if you 
can come up with a plan, reserve some time for it.  But if 
you wait until the end of April to start talking about how 
you're going to conduct depositions in May, you're going 
to find oh, this person's not available or this other 
person has some commitment or whatever.   
So the sooner you can block out time, come up 
with, you know, a general plan of how this is all going to 
happen, the better, because otherwise, I'll be hearing at 
the end of May, "We have two weeks left on our schedule, 
and we don't have dates yet for depositions."  And that's 
-- (indiscernible) litigation, try to avoid it by advanced 
planning.  If any depositions involve travel, figure it 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 64 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
out sooner rather than later.  Try to make the plans ahead 
of time.  If there are witnesses who are going to take the 
Fifth, try to find that out; try to, you know, identify 
who you're talking about.  Try to find out on your side if 
that's going to happen, let plaintiffs' counsel know.  It 
will affect the planning, it will affect overall 
scheduling.  You know, everybody's schedules will benefit 
from that kind of communication.  All right?  The most 
effective litigation in terms of efficiency are the ones 
where the lawyers, you know, sit down, open their 
calendars -- old-fashioned? -- you know, smartphones, 
whatever they are, and try to figure it out.  All right?  
Especially if you want to coordinate any depositions.  
Right?  You've got a lot of people; start talking about it 
sooner rather than later.  All right? 
Okay.  Anybody have anything else for me?  Are 
there any other cases where I should diverge from this 
schedule in any way?  Probably not, right? 
MR. EDWARDS:  No, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  All right, I will issue -- 
MS. WANG:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  I don't have 
anything on the schedules.  I just wanted to flag that 
there was one set of briefing around which we jointly 
submitted a briefing schedule and your Honor just said 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 65 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
that you had wanted an update on settlement discussions 
before entering that order.  So I can just point out that 
it's -- 
THE COURT:  That's fine.  I know what that is. 
MS. WANG:  It's in the Davies case. 
THE COURT:  That's fine.  Even though I said I 
was -- I might well set different schedules in each case, 
I don't really see the need to do that.  So you're on the 
same track.  You know, it may happen that, you know, one 
or two of them or three or four of them end up on a 
different schedule as we go, but for now let's keep them 
where they are.  And hopefully, all of that good-faith 
conference you're going to have about discovery will help 
keep you moving along.  If not, you know where I am.  All 
right? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, all.  Good luck with the 
settlement fund concept.  I'm rooting for you. 
(Whereupon, the matter is recessed.)

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
MARY DOE, 
Plaintiff,  
-v-  
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
and SARAH VICKERS, 
Defendants. 
Civ. 10758 (PAE) 
OPINION & ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
In this diversity action, plaintiff Mary Doe1 brings tort claims under New York law 
against, inter alia, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, the executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
Epstein (“Indyke and Kahn” or “the executor defendants”).  The executor defendants now move 
to dismiss Doe’s claim against them for punitive damages, on the grounds that, as a matter of 
New York law, such damages are categorically unavailable in a personal injury action against the 
personal representative of an estate.2  For the reasons that follow, the Court grants that motion.  
I. 
Background 
A. 
Doe’s Complaint 
Doe’s Complaint, filed on November 20, 2019, alleges a horrific course of sexual and 
psychological abuse at Epstein’s hands during 2004 and 2005.  Cmplt. ¶¶ 1–15 (summary 
account); id. ¶¶ 38–106 (detailed account).  It alleges that Doe came to the United States with her 
Doe has been granted leave to proceed pseudonymously.  Dkt. 21. 
Doe also sues Sarah Vickers, who is alleged to have served as Epstein’s scheduler and assistant.  
See Dkt. 1 (Complaint, or “Cmplt.”) ¶ 19.  Doe’s bid for punitive damages against Vickers is not 
implicated by this motion.

parents as a young refugee from a war-torn country, and was working in pursuit of a promising 
career as a model when, in 2004, at age 16, she met Epstein through another model.  Id. ¶ 2.  
Epstein made clear to Doe how important and powerful he was and promised to help her with her 
modeling career and college admissions.  Id. ¶ 3.  Doe, in turn, “believed she could trust him” 
and “that he could change her life.”  Id. ¶ 4.  Epstein, however, “used his power over Mary to 
sexually abuse her, viciously and repeatedly.”  Id. ¶ 5.  Aided by defendant Sarah Vickers, 
Epstein’s scheduler and assistant, Epstein “would summon Mary to his Manhattan townhouse, 
order her to give him massages, and then subject her to sexual acts, the severity of which 
increased over time.”  Id.; see also id. ¶ 19.  The Complaint graphically chronicles Epstein’s acts 
of sexual abuse in the townhouse, which included forcing Doe to perform oral sex on him and 
later raping her.  Id. ¶¶ 7–9; 56–105.  
In late 2005, the Complaint alleges, Doe—as a result of an incident at the townhouse—
“suddenly saw the truth: she was not even a human being to Epstein, she was an object,” and 
Epstein was treating her as a prostitute, “one of many girls he treated as sexual objects.”  Id. 
¶ 11.  Doe had a breakdown, almost immediately thereafter left New York City, returned to her 
parents’ home across the country, and never saw Epstein again.  Id. ¶ 12.  Epstein’s abuse caused 
Doe to abandon her modeling career and left her humiliated, angry, and suicidal, with debilitating 
panic attacks and “dramatic psychological scars.”  Id. ¶¶ 13–14.  Epstein’s arrest in July 2019 
gave Doe “brief[] hope that he might finally face consequences,” but his death in August 2019 at 
a federal jail in Manhattan “left Mary with the desolate sense that he has evaded justice yet 
again.”  Id. ¶ 15. 
In this action, Doe brings claims, under New York law, of battery, id. ¶¶ 108–13, assault, 
id. ¶¶ 114–19, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, id. ¶¶ 120–27, against Indyke

and Kahn, solely in their capacities as executors of Epstein’s estate, id. ¶ 18, and against Vickers, 
for her “integral role in operating Epstein’s operation of sex trafficking Mary and other girls,” id. 
¶ 19.  As its basis for personal jurisdiction over the executors, it alleges that “Epstein was subject 
to personal jurisdiction at the time of his death,” id. ¶ 22, “because the tortious acts giving rise to 
Plaintiff’s claims took place in New York State,” id. ¶ 23.  The Complaint seeks, in addition to 
compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs, “punitive damages in an amount to be 
determined at trial.”  Id. p. 19. 
B. 
The Executors’ Partial Motion to Dismiss 
 On January 21, 2020, the executor defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, Dkt. 17, 
and a supporting memorandum of law, Dkt. 18 (“Def. Mem.”).  It sought dismissal of the prayer 
for punitive damages on the ground that such damages cannot, as a matter of New York law, be 
sought against the personal representatives of an estate.  On March 3, 2020, Doe filed a 
memorandum of law in opposition, Dkt. 28 (“Doe Opp’n”), and a supporting declaration by 
Daniel Mullkoff, Esq., Dkt. 29 (“Mullkoff Decl.”), which attached Epstein’s will.  On March 20, 
2020, the executor defendants filed a reply.  Dkt. 33 (“Def. Reply”). 
II. 
Applicable Legal Standards Under Rule 12(b)(6)  
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must plead “enough 
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim will only have “facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads 
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A complaint is 
properly dismissed where, as a matter of law, “the allegations in a complaint, however true, 
could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558.  When resolving a 
motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint

and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Steginsky v. Xcelera Inc., 
741 F.3d 365, 368 (2d Cir. 2014).  That tenet, however, “is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Pleadings that offer only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic 
recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
III. 
Discussion 
 In moving to dismiss Doe’s prayer for punitive damages against them, the executor 
defendants argue that New York law applies to this personal injury action and categorically 
prohibits an award of punitive damages against the personal representatives of an estate.  
Specifically, they note, § 11-3.2(a)(1) of New York’s Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) 
provides: 
No cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of 
the person liable for the injury.  For any injury, an action may be brought or 
continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive 
damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought 
to recover damages for personal injury. 
EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1) (emphasis added).  
Applying this statute, courts have held punitive damages unavailable in personal injury 
actions against executors or administrators of estates.  These include federal courts determining 
the damages available for constitutional-tort claims under New York law, see, e.g., Graham v. 
Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (precluding, based on EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), 
punitive damages claims in § 1983 action against estate administrators, and noting that New 
York law is “very clear” on this point); Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) 
(overturning, based on EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), jury’s punitive damages award in § 1983 case 
against estate, and noting “strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an 
estate on account of wrongful conduct of the decedent”), and state courts in personal injury 
actions governed by New York law, see, e.g., Gordon v. Nathan, 352 N.Y.S.2d 464, 464 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 4 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 60-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 4 of 17

(1st Dep’t. 1974) (affirming dismissal of punitive damages claim because, under EPTL 
§ 11-3.2(a)(1), defendant’s death precluded recovery of punitive damages from personal 
representatives of estate); cf. Flaum v. Birnbaum, 582 N.Y.S.2d 853, 857 (4th Dep’t. 1992) 
(affirming denial of punitive damages in case against deceased executor; citing EPTL 
§ 11-3.2(a)(1) and the “strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an 
estate on account of the wrongful conduct of the decedent”).   
The law of a majority of states is in accord with EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), as reflected in the 
Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (1979) (“Punitive 
damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor[.]”); see also Doe 
Opp’n at 12 (acknowledging that “a majority of states do not permit punitive damages against 
estates”).  This majority rule aligns with “[t]he general rule under federal common law,” that “an 
action survives the death of a party insofar as it is remedial[,] and not penal[,] in nature.”  See, e.g., 
Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Exeter Holdings, Ltd. v. Haltman, No. 13 Civ. 5475 
(JS) (AKT), 2017 WL 9485707, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017) (collecting cases), report and 
recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 3981299 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2017).   
The justification commonly given for precluding punitive damage awards against estates 
is that punishment and deterrence—the recognized bases for imposing punitive damages on a 
tortfeasor—are not advanced by imposing punitive damages on his or her estate.  As the New 
Mexico Supreme Court explained in adopting the majority rule:  “[P]unishment and deterrence 
are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages from the estate of deceased 
tortfeasors”; “[w]hen the tortfeasor cannot be punished for his culpable behavior, punitive 
damages no longer have the desired effect and, therefore, the victim loses the legal entitlement to

recover those damages.”  Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 871 P.2d 1343, 1351 
(N.M. 1994) (canvassing laws of other states). 
 Doe does not dispute that EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1) precludes punitive damages in a personal 
injury action under New York law.  Instead, Doe makes three arguments: (1) that defendants’ 
motion is premature, Doe Mem. at 4; (2) that defendants’ motion is improperly styled as a 
motion to dismiss, id. at 3; and (3) that the law of the United States Virgin Islands (“USVI”), not 
New York law, applies, and permits punitive damages against an estate, id. at 4–13. 
Doe’s first argument is quickly dispatched.  Doe cites cases where courts have declined 
to resolve motions to dismiss aimed at prayers for relief, finding such motions premature.  See id. 
at 4 (citations omitted).  But a review of these cases reflects that the motions in those cases were 
not based on categorical preclusions of punitive damages.  In contrast, where punitive damages 
have been unavailable as a matter of law, courts have not hesitated to dismiss prayers for such 
damages at the threshold.  See, e.g., Murtha v. N.Y. State Gaming Comm’n, No. 17 Civ. 10040 
(NSR), 2019 WL 4450687, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2019) (dismissing demand for punitive 
damages under the New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”) because it “does not 
provide for punitive damages”); Rosen v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 18 Civ. 6670 (AT), 
2019 WL 4039958, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2019) (granting motion to dismiss demand for 
punitive damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the New York City 
Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”) where neither statute permitted a plaintiff to recover punitive 
damages); Talarico v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 367 F. Supp. 3d 161, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) 
(dismissing demand for punitive damages against Port Authority where “the Third Circuit and 
the overwhelming majority of district courts within this Circuit have held that punitive damages 
are not available against” that defendant (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Canete

(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2018) (dismissing demand for punitive damages where such relief was 
“precluded as a matter of law”); Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Ctr. v. Gen. Reins. Corp., 
No. 16 Civ. 2063 (CM), 2016 WL 5793996, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2016) (“In this case, the 
circumstances surrounding the denial of the insurance indemnification claim do not warrant the 
rare exception provided for punitive damages under a breach of contract claim.  For this reason, 
the Court grants Defendant’s motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim.”); SJB ex rel. Berkhout 
v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03 Civ. 6653 (NRB), 2004 WL 1586500, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. July 
14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claim because such damages are unavailable in § 1983 
actions against municipalities).  Provided that New York law applies to this action, this case, too, 
involves a categorical preclusion of such damages, under EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), that can be 
adjudicated at the threshold. 
Doe’s second argument is that the defendant-executors’ challenge is improperly brought 
as a motion to dismiss.  Doe Mem. at 3 & n.3.  There is divided case authority on this point.  
Courts, including in the cases cited above, have granted motions to dismiss prayers for such 
relief.  But others have declined to entertain such motions, stating that, “[b]ecause punitive 
damages are a form of damages, not an independent cause of action, a motion to dismiss a prayer 
for relief in the form of punitive damages is ‘procedurally premature.’”  Farina v. Metro. Transp. 
Auth., 409 F. Supp. 3d 173, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting Hunter v. Palisades Acquisition XVI, 
LLC, No. 16 Civ. 8779 (ER), 2017 WL 5513636, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2017)); see also, e.g.,

961 F. Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   
The Court has no occasion to resolve this conceptual debate, because the executors’ 
motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) alternatively can be treated as a motion to strike under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).  See C. Wright & A. Miller, 5C Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 1380 (3d ed.) (“[T]he technical name given to a motion challenging a pleading is of 
little importance inasmuch as prejudice to the nonmoving party hardly can result from treating a 
motion that has been inaccurately denominated a motion to strike as a motion to dismiss the 
complaint.”).  And under Rule 12(f), on a motion or sua sponte, a court may strike from a 
pleading an “insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous 
matter.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  Although motions to strike under Rule 12(f) are generally 
“disfavored and granted only if there is a strong reason to do so,” Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. 
Media, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 2227 (PAC), 2013 WL 1746062, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Roe v. City of New York, 151 F. Supp. 2d 495, 510 
(S.D.N.Y. 2001)); see also Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d 
Cir. 1976)), ample authority permits striking prayers for punitive damages where such relief is 
unavailable as a matter of law.  See, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 
851 F. Supp. 2d 512, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting motion to strike sections of complaint

necessary to sustain punitive damages award in case involving fraud and deceit); Ladenburg 
Thalmann & Co. v. Imaging Diagnostic Sys., Inc., 176 F. Supp. 2d 199, 207 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) 
(granting motion to strike punitive damages because complaint did not allege, inter alia, egregious 
conduct sufficient to sustain such an award); Brady v. Port. Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 93 Civ. 1679 
(NG) (CLP), 1998 WL 724061, at *2–3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 1998) (granting motion to strike 
punitive damages claims on grounds that Port Authority was immune from such damages); Nash v. 
Coram Healthcare Corp., No. 96 Civ. 0298 (LMM), 1996 WL 363166, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 1996) 
(granting motion to strike prayer for punitive damages because complaint did not allege facts 
sufficient to support such damages in breach of contract case).   
Here, there is practical wisdom in treating defendant’s motion as one to strike, if doing so 
is necessary to enable the Court to resolve at the jump the viability of Doe’s prayer for punitive 
damages.  With numerous personal injury actions pending against the Epstein estate as a result of 
the recent enactment of the New York Child Victims Act, there is value in clarifying—for the 
parties and settlors—the damages available in actions where the law permits a sure answer on 
this point. 
Doe’s final argument is that USVI, not New York, law governs whether punitive 
damages are available.  Because this Court sits in New York, it applies a New York choice of 
law analysis to that question.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 
(1941); Md. Cas. Co. v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 332 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 2003) (“A federal court 
sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum state.”).  “Where, as here, the 
claims sound in tort, New York courts apply an ‘interest analysis’ to determine choice-of-law 
issues.”  Golden v. Wyeth, Inc., No. 04 Civ. 2841 (JS), 2013 WL 4500879, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 20, 2013).  Under that analysis, punitive damages are considered to be conduct-regulating, 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 9 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 60-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 9 of 17

and “the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.” See, e.g., Starr 
Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., Inc., No. 14 Civ. 0463 (JMF), 2015 WL 2152816, *3 
(S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (quoting Guidi v. Inter-Cont’l Hotels Corp., No. 95 Civ. 9006 (LAP), 
2003 WL 1907901, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)); Bauta v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., No. 14 Civ. 3725 
(RER), 2019 WL 8060183, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2019).  Here, the torts alleged occurred 
entirely in New York.  The personal injury claims which Doe’s Complaint brings arise from 
sexual assaults and related conduct that, as alleged, occurred exclusively within New York 
City—in and around Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse.  
Doe counters by noting that, while this rule applies as a general matter, it may be overcome 
if there is good reason not to apply it.  Doe Mem. at 5 (citing Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. 
Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d 416, 424–25 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)).  In arguing that there is reason not to 
apply New York law to the punitive damages question here, Doe relies on the doctrine of dépeçage, 
under which courts may treat the choice of law analysis for one (or more) issues in a case––in 
this instance, the availability of punitive damages––as distinct from the rest of its analysis, here 
the applicability of New York law to Doe’s tort claims for compensatory damages.  Id.; see also 
2002 Lawrence R. Buchalter Alaska Tr. v. Phila. Fin. Life Assurance Co., 96 F. Supp. 3d 182, 
200 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Ally Fin. Inc., No. 11 Civ. 7010 (DLC), 
2012 WL 6616061, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2012).   
Doe argues that, although New York may have the greater interest in resolving issues 
relating to compensatory damages, the USVI, where the executors are domiciled and where 
Epstein’s will is to be probated, has the greater interest as to punitive damages, which, unlike 
compensatory damages, are defendant-focused.  Doe Mem. at 7–8.  Doe does not argue that the 
executor-defendants themselves merit punishment or are in need of deterrence.  Instead, Doe 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 10 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 60-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 10 of 17

argues that Epstein’s decision to alter his will shortly before his suicide to provide that it would 
be probated in the USVI was strategically motivated.  She argues that his executors “should not 
be permitted to selectively avail themselves of certain benefits of USVI law but avoid those 
aspects of USVI law that they do not like.”  Id. at 7. 
The Court is unpersuaded.  Whatever benefits Epstein envisioned for his estate by virtue 
of probating his will in the USVI, Doe does not articulate any relevant to this litigation.  Other 
than conclusorily, Doe does not argue that the decision to probate Epstein’s will in the USVI will 
have any adverse bearing on a personal injury action brought against the estate in New York that 
involves tortious conduct in New York.  Doe does not argue, for example, that the probating of 
Epstein’s will in the USVI stands to insulate his assets from recovery from such a plaintiff, or 
otherwise impede her or others victimized in New York from recovering on meritorious claims.  
Doe’s point that the estate may prosper from being probated in the USVI is disconnected from 
her claims.3   
More fundamentally, Doe does not articulate any concrete interest that the USVI has in 
either vindicating the rights of a victim sexually abused in a Manhattan townhouse in 2004 and 
2005 or, specially relevant to punitive damages, in assuring that the perpetrator of that abuse is 
adequately punished and deterred.  In contrast, the Second Circuit has noted the strong interest 
that New York has with respect to “conduct-regulating” rules, including regarding damages, with 
respect to unlawful behavior within its borders: 
“If conflicting conduct-regulating laws are at issue, the law of the jurisdiction 
where the tort occurred will generally apply because that jurisdiction has the 
greatest interest in regulating behavior within its borders.”  Cooney v. Osgood 
If anything, the probating of the estate in the USVI may stand to benefit the estate’s creditors, 
and thereby potentially Doe, to the extent that an estate probated in the USVI may avoid the high 
estate-tax rates imposed by New York State.

Mach., Inc., 81 N.Y.2d 66, 72 (1993).  In Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian 
Bank, SAL[,] . . . we observed that, under New York law, when the jurisdictions of 
the conduct and injury are distinct, “it is the place of the allegedly wrongful 
conduct that generally has superior ‘interests in protecting the reasonable 
expectations of the parties who relied on the laws of that place to govern their 
primary conduct and in the admonitory effect that applying its law will have on 
similar conduct in the future.’”  [739 F.3d 45, 50–51 (2d Cir. 2013)] (quoting 
Schultz [v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc., 65 N.Y.2d 189, 198 (1985)]) (alterations 
omitted).  Here, the allegedly wrongful conduct . . .  took place in New York . . . .  
We therefore conclude that New York’s rules on fraud damages and negligent 
misrepresentation apply. 
AHW Inv. P’ship, MFS v. Citigroup, Inc., 661 F. App’x 2, 5 (2d Cir. 2016).  New York’s interest 
is also reinforced by the fact that Doe’s suit is timely only by virtue of the state’s recent 
enactment of the New York Child Victims Act, which temporarily revived time-barred suits.  See 
Cmplt. ¶ 107. 
That New York law governs the availability of punitive damages is further reinforced by 
Doe’s having sued the executor defendants under EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1).  It is problematic for her 
to cherrypick within that provision, invoking the part that authorizes a personal injury suit 
against an executor while disclaiming the balance, which delimits the recovery available in such 
a suit.4  See Blissett, 940 F. Supp. at 457 (“[I]t would be an anomalous situation indeed if 
plaintiff were allowed to proceed with this [§] 1983 action against the estate of Casey because of 
[§] 11-3.2(a)(1), while at the same time he was allowed to recover relief in the form of punitive 
damages, which clearly is beyond the scope of relief which that statute authorizes.”).  Such a 
result is also inconsistent with the doctrine of dépeçage, where one forum’s law is “applied to 
regulate certain issues arising from a given transaction or occurrence, while those of another 
system regulate the other issues.”  Schwartz v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., 492 F. Supp. 2d 308, 328 
Doe’s claims undisputedly all qualify as personal injury claims.  See N.Y. Gen. Constr. Law 
§ 37-a. (defining “personal injury” as including “an assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other 
actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff, or of another”).  Doe does not argue 
otherwise.

539 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2008).  Here, Doe, in selectively drawing upon EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), seeks 
to invoke dépeçage to apply two different sets of laws to a single issue.  The doctrine does not 
invite such a result. 
Finally, Adelson, on which Doe relies in claiming that USVI law governs punitive 
damages, is inapposite.  Adelson had brought an earlier action in this District for defamation, in 
breach of Nevada law, against the National Jewish Democratic Council and its chair (together, 
“NJDC”).   Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d at 420–21.  That action had been dismissed pursuant to 
Nevada’s anti-SLAPP statute.  NJDC then sued Adelson, seeking punitive damages under that 
same Nevada statute.  Id.  On Adelson’s motion to dismiss the punitive damages prayer, Judge 
Oetken held that Nevada’s interest was stronger than New York’s as to punitive damages, 
because Adelson had brought the initial suit under Nevada law and because it had been 
dismissed under the Nevada SLAPP statute on which the NJDC now pursued punitive damages.  
He reasoned that “because the litigant has attempted to use Nevada’s defamation law to chill 
First Amendment rights, Nevada has a corresponding interest in punishing the litigant for 
maliciously invoking Nevada law and in deterring future litigants from doing the same.”  
Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d at 426 (citing Schultz, 65 N.Y.2d at 198).  Noting that “[p]unitive 
damages are designed to punish the defendant, not to compensate the plaintiff,” Judge Oetken 
explained that “the choice-of-law inquiry for punitive damages provisions is necessarily 
defendant-focused” in this way.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Golden, 
2013 WL 4500879, at *3).  By contrast, Judge Oetken concluded that New York’s interest in the 
dispute was “relatively attenuated” and effectively limited to the fact that the suit was filed in 
federal district court in Manhattan where, notably, the claims were brought under Nevada 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 13 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 60-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 13 of 17

defamation law.  “After all, New York lacks a particularized interest either in protecting 
defendants from liability under Nevada defamation law or in controlling the behavior of litigants 
who file in the federal courts.  And where the locus jurisdiction has a merely fortuitous 
relationship with the case, that jurisdiction’s interest in the case is minimal.”  Id. at 426–27 
(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Doe’s case in this District, in contrast to 
Adelson, does not build on a prior litigation in, or based on the law of, the USVI. 
In any event, the choice of law debate here appears academic.  That is because, while the 
USVI does not have a statute on point and USVI courts have not squarely resolved the issue, it is 
likely that USVI common law would not permit an award of punitive damages against an estate.  
In 2011, the USVI Supreme Court instructed courts to apply what it terms a “Banks analysis” to 
determine USVI common law.  This entails consideration of “three non-dispositive factors”: 
(1) whether any USVI court has previously adopted a particular rule; (2) the position taken by a 
majority of courts of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which rule represents the 
soundest rule for the USVI.  See Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, 60 V.I. 597, 600 (2014); 
Matthew v. Herman, 56 V.I. 674, 680 (2012); Banks v. Int’l Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 
979 (2011).  The parties differ as to how these factors apply, but the executors’ assessment is the 
more persuasive. 
As to the first Banks factor, USVI courts have repeatedly cited the Restatement (Second) 
of Torts § 908 favorably.  Twice, albeit in dicta, they have expressly quoted the language in 
comment (a) to § 908 that bars an award of punitive damages against the estate of a decedent 
tortfeasor.  See Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 2009) (“Punitive 
damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor nor, ordinarily, in 
an action under a death statute.” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (1979))

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 60-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 14 of 17

(citing Boyd v. Atlas Motor Inn, Inc., 16 V.I. 367, 368–69 (D.V.I. 1979) (interpreting the Virgin 
Island’s wrongful death statue, 5 V.I.C. § 76, to preclude punitive damages)); Booth v. Bowen, 
Civ. No. 2006-217 (CVG), 2008 WL 220067, at *5 (D.V.I. Jan. 10, 2008) (same)5; see also 
Pappas v. Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Ass’n, 69 V.I. 3, 15 n.8 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2015) (applying 
Banks analysis to hold that USVI courts would adopt Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908, and 
citing five USVI cases in accord); Powell v. Chi-Co’s Distrib. Inc., No. ST-13-TOR-14, 
2014 WL 1394183, at *2 n.13 (V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 3, 2014) (“Applying a Banks analysis, the 
Court finds that Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) reflects the common law of this 
jurisdiction . . . .  [C]onsidering the longstanding application of the Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 908(2) in this jurisdiction and the apparent widespread application of this rule in a 
majority of jurisdictions, the Court finds that the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) 
represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands, and is in accord with local public policy.”).  
Doe has not cited any contrary authority. 
As to the second Banks factor, the parties agree that, consistent with the Restatement, 
most U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of punitive damages against a tortfeasor’s estate.  
See, e.g., Crabtree ex rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 138 (Ind. 2005) (“[t]he 
majority view denies punitive damages” from a deceased tortfeasor’s estate); Jay Zitter, Annotation, 
Claim for punitive damages in tort action as surviving death of tortfeasor or person wronged, 30 
A.L.R. 4th 707 (2020); 1 Punitive Damages: Law and Prac. 2d § 9:8 (2019 ed.) (“The prevailing 
view appears to be that punitive damages may not be recovered against the estate of a deceased 
wrongdoer.”).  Doe notes that some jurisdictions (like New York) have adopted this result by 
The decisions in Hamilton and Booth were dicta on this point, because the executor in each 
case was the plaintiff, not the defendant.

statute while others have done so by court decision.  Doe Mem. at 12.  This distinction, however, 
does not appear germane to the Banks inquiry. 
As to the third Banks factor, the parties have not cited any evidence—beyond USVI 
courts having repeatedly cited Restatement § 908 with favor, including in the course of a Banks 
analysis—as to which rule would most soundly fit the USVI’s interests.  Beyond recognizing 
that USVI courts appear comfortable with the majority rule, the Court therefore cannot assign 
significant independent weight to this factor.  Doe notes that the USVI’s attorney general, in a 
separate lawsuit, is pursuing punitive damages against the Epstein estate based on alleged 
predations by Epstein in the USVI.  See Mullkoff Decl. Ex. B ¶¶ 307–10.  Doe further argues 
that because the only heir listed in Epstein’s will—his brother Mark Epstein—allegedly knew or 
had constructive knowledge of Epstein’s pattern of sexual abuse, it is just to deny him recovery 
from the estate by exposing the estate to punitive damages awards in cases such as hers.  Doe 
Mem. at 11.  But the decision by a government lawyer to attempt to obtain such damages in a 
high-profile case involving allegations of extreme conduct, or the alleged guilty knowledge of an 
heir in this case, do not speak to the question that the third Banks factor assays: which rule of law 
best durably serves the USVI’s interests.  The Court therefore has no basis to treats this Banks 
factor as countervailing, let alone outweighing, the first two. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons above, the Court grants the defendant-executors’ motion to dismiss the 
prayer for punitive damages against them.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to 
terminate the motion pending at docket 17.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 15, 
Plaintiff,  
-v-  
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
Defendants. 
Civ. 10653 (PAE) 
ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
In this diversity action, plaintiff Jane Doe 15 (“Doe”)1 brings claims of battery, assault, 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in 
their capacities as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey Epstein.  These claims arise from Doe’s 
allegations of sexual trafficking and abuse perpetrated against her by Epstein in 2004, when she 
was age 15.  Doe alleges that Doe visited Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in New York City, 
where Epstein’s secretary photographed her and groomed her for future sexual exploitation; on 
Epstein’s behalf, the secretary later invited Doe to visit Epstein at his ranch in New Mexico, and 
arranged Doe’s visit.  See Dkt. 1 (“Cmplt.”) ¶¶ 2–4, 25–26, 30–37.  Epstein’s sexual abuse of 
Doe occurred during the visit to the New Mexico ranch that ensued.  Id. ¶¶ 5–6, 41–69. 
The defendants have filed a partial motion to dismiss, directed solely at Doe’s prayer for 
punitive damages.  They argue that New Mexico law governs Doe’s claims, and that under New 
Mexico law, punitive damages are unavailable in a personal injury action against the personal 
Doe has been granted leave to proceed pseudonymously.  Dkt. 22. 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 1 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 61-1     Filed 04/30/20     Page 1 of 4

representative of an estate.  See Dkt. 18 (motion); Dkt. 19 (memorandum of law in support); 
Dkt. 34 (reply).  Doe opposes that motion.  Dkt. 29 (memorandum of law in opposition). 
The Court grants defendants’ motion.  The Court’s analysis substantially tracks the 
analysis in a memorandum and opinion it issued earlier this week granting a motion seeking the 
same relief in another case in which a plaintiff has brought the same personal injury claims 
against the executors arising from sexual abuse Epstein allegedly perpetrated on her.  See Mary 
Doe v. Indyke and Kahn, 19 Civ. 10758 (PAE) (“Mary Doe”); see id. Dkt. 38 (“Mary Doe Op.”) 
(issued April 28, 2020).  The Court here incorporates that decision by reference. 
In Mary Doe, Epstein’s abuse was alleged to have occurred in his Manhattan townhouse.  
The Court noted that the New York statute that authorizes personal injury actions against the 
personal representative of the decedent precludes punitive damages in such actions, see Mary 
Doe Op. at 4 (citing New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) § 11-3.2(a)(1)), and 
required dismissal of Mary Doe’s prayer for such damages, id. at 4–6.  The Court rejected Mary 
Doe’s counter-arguments: that defendants’ motion was premature, id. at 6–7, and improperly 
styled as a motion to dismiss, id. at 7–9, and that the law of the United States Virgin Islands 
(“USVI”), where Epstein’s estate is being probated, applies, and permits punitive damages 
against an estate in such an action, id. at 9–16.  As to the final argument, the Court noted that 
under New York choice-of-law rules, the substantive law of the location of the tortious conduct 
occurred generally applies as to punitive damages, and that there was no reason to depart from 
that rule here, id. at 9–14.  In any event, the Court held, it is likely that, as a matter of common 
law, the USVI—like New York, the majority of states, and Restatement (Second) of Torts 
§ 908—would not allow imposition of punitive damages on a tortfeasor’s estate, id. at 14-16. 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 2 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 61-1     Filed 04/30/20     Page 2 of 4

The parties in this case are represented by the same counsel as in Mary Doe, and make 
substantially the same arguments for and against dismissal.  The one variation is that, because 
Epstein’s abuse is alleged to have occurred at the New Mexico ranch, defendants argue that New 
Mexico law applies.  See Dkt. 19 at 2–6; Dkt. 34 at 5–8.  But that, defendants argue, does not 
change the result, because New Mexico common law as announced by the state supreme court, 
like EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), bars punitive damages in a personal injury action against a tortfeasor’s 
estate.  See Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 871 P.2d 1343, 1351–52 (N.M. 1994) 
(canvassing laws; noting that “punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling 
recovery of punitive damages from the estate of deceased tortfeasors”; and adopting majority 
rule that “[w]hen the tortfeasor cannot be punished for his culpable behavior, punitive damages 
no longer have the desired effect and, therefore, the victim loses the legal entitlement to recover 
those damages”); see also Barbara R. as next friend of S.R. v. Couch, No. 03 Civ. 1225 (MCA) 
(WDS), 2006 WL 8443923, at *28 (D.N.M. Sept. 30, 2006) (citing Jaramillo and noting that 
“[t]he rationale behind this rule is that ‘to punish the estate ignores the central purpose of 
punitive damages, which is to punish the tortfeasor and to deter him from repeating the wrongful 
act”).  Doe, for her part, does not dispute that New Mexico law mirrors New York law.  Instead, 
in opposing dismissal, she makes the same three arguments as in Mary Doe.   
The Court again finds punitive damages unavailable as a matter of law and plaintiffs’ 
counter-arguments unavailing.  As to the third argument, relating to choice of law, unlike in 
Mary Doe, there is indeed room for debate about which jurisdiction’s law applies.  But the 
debate is between New York (where the grooming process began) and New Mexico (where the 
sexual abuse occurred).  And under either state’s law, imposition of punitive damages on the 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 61-1     Filed 04/30/20     Page 3 of 4

Epstein estate is squarely prohibited.  Doe does not have any stronger argument than did Mary 
Doe that USVI law applies in her case, or, if it did, that it would permit such damages. 
The Court, accordingly, grants defendants’ motion to dismiss the prayer for punitive 
damages.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at Dkt. 18. 
SO ORDERED.

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants in the above-referenced actions.  We write on behalf of all parties to 
update the Court regarding settlement and discovery.   
As the Court is aware, there have been no settlement discussions in any of the individual 
above-referenced cases.  The parties’ efforts regarding settlement have been singularly focused 
on the establishment of a voluntary, independent claims resolution program, the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program.  We are pleased to report that, this past weekend, the Co-
Executors entered into a tripartite agreement with claimants’ counsel (specifically, counsel for 
Plaintiffs in the above-referenced actions, Brad Edwards, and counsel for plaintiffs in four other 
actions pending before Your Honor, David Boies) and the Attorney General of the United States 
Virgin Islands pursuant to which the Program may now move forward.  Earlier today, the Co-
Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands the 
status report attached hereto as Exhibit A.  As stated therein, the Co-Executors, with the 
support of claimants’ counsel and the USVI Attorney General, intend to authorize 
commencement of the Program on Monday, June 15, 2020. Most, if not all, of the Plaintiffs in 
the above-referenced actions intend to participate in the Program. 
Meanwhile, the parties continue to meet and confer in efforts to resolve various discovery 
disputes.   
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

CO-EXECUTORS' STATUS REPORT ON VO LUNT ARY COMPENSATION 
PROGRAM AND PRESENTATION OF PROGRAM PROTOCOL 
On November 14, 2019, the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Co-
Executors") filed their Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution 
Program (the "Expedited Motion") seeking to establish an independent and voluntary claims 
resolution program (the .. Program") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey 
E. Epstein, deceased. As promised in the Expedited Motion, the Co-Executors now submit to the 
Court the detailed Program protocol (the "Protocol," copy attached as Exhibit A hereto) designed 
and developed over several months by independent, nationally recognized claims administration 
experts with extensive input from the Co-Executors and other interested parties, including 
claimants and their legal representatives. Because the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent and with the support of claimants' counsel and the Attorney General of the United States 
Virgin Islands, the Co-Executors intend to authorize commencement on Monday, June 15, 2020 
of formal claims resolution proceedings under the Program, absent contrary direction from the 
Court.

BACKGROUND 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 2 
As detailed in the Expedited Motion and the Co-Executors' subsequent filings with the 
Court, the Program will provide all eligible claimants an opportunity to receive compensation and 
voluntarily resolve their claims of sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein through a confidential, non-
adversarial alternative to litigation, utilizing a process that is sensitive to the experiences and 
concern of claimants and treats them with compassion, dignity and respect. 1 
On February 4, 2020, the Court heard extensive witness testimony concerning the Program 
(February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr. at I 03: 12-186: 14); at that hearing, multiple claimants' counsel also 
spoke in favor of implementing the Program. (Id. 84: 11-85:2; 85:6-19; 92:24-93:8.) As Your 
Honor recognized, the Program is not only consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Co-
Executors, but in fact " ... we agreed that everybody believes this program is a great program ... " 
(Id. at 113:24-25.) That drumbeat of approval continues to swell; since the Co-Executors' most 
recent filing with the Court concerning the Program,2 counsel for 69 individual claimants have 
come forward to the Court in support of the Program.3

Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program 
and Presentation of Program Protocol 
II. 
THE PROGRAM PROTOCOL 
The Program Administrator and Designers have now finalized the Protocol for the 
Program, in close consultation with claimants' counsel and the Co-Executors.4 As contemplated 
in the Expedited Motion, the Protocol sets forth the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
• 
The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a claimant may 
have unless and until she accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
release. 
A claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop 
participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to 
execution of the release. 
• 
The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled, or 
overseen by the Co-Executors. The Program Administrator is responsible for 
all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual 
claims submitted to the Program. The Administrator will have final, binding, 
and exclusive authority to determine claimant eligibility and the valuation of 
each eligible individual claim. Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant 
to the Protocol are not subject to review or modification in any way by the Co-
Executors or any other party or entity. 
• 
Subject to total Estate assets available, there is no cap or limitation on the 
aggregate amount of funds available to compensate all eligible claimants or on 
the amount of compensation to be made to each individual claimant. Each 
individual claim will be evaluated separately by the Program Administrator. 
The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive discretion, issues 
of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will pay all eligible 
claims based on the Administrator's determination. 
• 
All claimants will be treated with respect, dignity, and fairness without regard 
to race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender, or disability. 
To ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Program Administrator will 
manage the process so that all claimants can equally access the Program's claim 
process. 
Individuals with disabilities will be given the opportunity to 
effectively communicate their claims and to request special process 
accommodations. 
(See Protocol at pp. 1-2.) 
4. The Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands also expressed her detailed views on the structure and formation 
of the Program, both through filings with the Court and direct communications with the Program Administrator.

and Presentation of Program Protocol

Page4 
The Protocol also sets forth detailed aspects of the Program's administration, including 
eligibility criteria for the Program, proof requirements and claims procedures, the methodology 
for claims evaluation and determining compensatory awards, and timing and regular reports to the 
Court, as follows: 
• 
Eligibility. The Protocol identifies the criteria to determine whether a claimant 
is eligible to receive compensation under the Program. (See Protocol at pp. 3-
4.) 
• 
Proof Requirements and Claims Procedures. The Protocol determines what 
types of supporting documentation or other evidence each individual will be 
required to submit to substantiate her claim, satisfy Program requirements, and 
allow the Program Administrator to review, process and evaluate that claim. 
(See Protocol at pp. 4-5.) 
• 
Claims Evaluation and Determination Methodology. The Protocol defines 
the factors and considerations to be used to determine the amount of 
compensation to be offered to any eligible claimant. (See Protocol at pp. 5-6.) 
• 
Timing. The Protocol sets forth the timeframe of the Program, including an 
effective commencement date and deadline for submission of all claims. (See 
Protocol at pp. 4-5.) 
• 
Reporting. The Protocol reflects the Program Administrator's commitment to 
provide the Court with regular monthly reports regarding the aggregate number 
and total value of claims paid each month through the Program. (See Protocol 
at p. 9.) 
III. 
URGENT NEED TO COMMENCE OF PROGRAM OPERA TIO NS 
In their fiduciary capacity, the Co-Executors engaged in extensive discussions with 
relevant parties in interest regarding the independent, fair, and timely resolution of the sexual abuse 
claims against Mr. Epstein. As noted above, many existing and potential claimants have expressed 
through their representatives their preference to participate in the Program rather than proceeding 
with litigation. Although there will be significant expense in administering the Program, the Co-
Executors contemplate that the Program will substantially reduce the expenses to the Estate of 
litigating multiple lawsuits in numerous jurisdictions, and thus ultimately reduce expenses to the 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 8 of 20

benefit of all parties with an interest in the Estate, including claimants and creditors. 5 The 
expedited nature of the Program will also ensure resolution and compensation to claimants in a far 
more timely manner than through litigation. 
As described above, the Protocol is designed to ensure the proportionate restitution of 
approved claims for all claimants, in a manner that will provide similar compensation to similarly 
situated claimants. The Program is in the best interests of both claimants and the Estate because, 
among other things, it avoids the potential of disproportionate and inconsistent awards and should 
help to reduce the time, exposure and burden of handling claims through the courts, which could 
involve years of litigation and appeals and consume enormous resources, along with inflicting on 
all affected parties costs attendant to delay and uncertainty. 
IV. 
FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM 
As the Court is aware, the Attorney General on January 31, 2020 unilaterally imposed 
criminal activity liens on the Estate's bank account in the Virgin Islands, freezing then-available 
funds - funds over which this Court has exclusive jurisdiction - for administration of the Estate 
and implementation of the Program.6 On February 24, 2020, the Attorney General imposed similar 
liens against Southern Trust Company, Inc., one of the entities within the Estate. The Co-
Executors have challenged the validity of the Attorney General's liens, and moved the Superior 
5. 
In the absence of the Program, litigation alleging sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein has increased in scope, pace and 
expense: there are now 22 separate lawsuits brought by 34 individual claimants pending against the Co-
Executors, primarily in the state and federal courts of New York. Discovery proceedings in those actions -
including document demands, interrogatories, non-party subpoenas, and motions to compel -
continue to ratchet 
up each passing week. 
6. 
Following the Co-Executors' resulting emergency motion for release of funds necessary for administration of the 
Estate, the Court directed the Attorney General to lift her liens in amounts sufficient to allow the Co-Executors 
to pay the Estate's operational expenses and legal fees.

Court to vacate them in their entirety.7 However, pending detennination of that motion - as well 
as this Court's approval of the estimated budget for and expenses of designing, implementing and 
administering the Program, submitted by the Co-Executors on February 4, 2020 - the Co-
Executors and the Attorney General have reached consensual resolution in which the latter will 
promptly lift those liens to pay amounts owed for the Program and to begin funding of the 
Program's active operations, including payment of compensation determinations to eligible 
claimants. 8

Because the need for the Program has grown increasingly urgent, and with the support of 
claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining impediments have 
been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol attached as Exhibit A hereto 
-the Co-Executors intend to move forward with the Program on Monday, June 15, 2020, absent 
contrary direction from the Court.9

7. See Expedited Motion to Vacate Liens, dated March 17, 2020 (Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands vs. Jndyke, 
et al., Case No. ST•20-CV-14). The Attorney General filed no response to that expedited motion. 
8. 
As part of that resolution, the Co-Executors agreed not to assert that the Attorney General's release of such limited 
funds will act as a waiver of Government's ability, if any, to object to the Program's administrative expenses, 
including those paid with these initial funds. 
9. 
The Co-Executors recognize the extraordinary difficulties imposed by the coronavirus pandemic on the 
functioning of the courts of the Virgin Islands. To the extent the Court wishes to conduct a remote conference in 
this matter, either telephonically or via videolink, the Co-Executors and their counsel will of course make 
themselves available.

Independent 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
PROTOCOL 
May 29, 2020 
I. 
PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW 
The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") is a voluntary, independent Program that 
has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by 
Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). 
The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Estate") has retained the services of nationally recognized claims 
administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the 
Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the "Administrator"). This 
Protocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and 
representatives of the Estate. 
Through the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and 
offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse. 
The Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
• 
The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have 
unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
Release. 
A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop 
participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution 
of the Release. 
• 
The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or 
overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to 
the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the 
Program. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to 
determine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. 
Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to 
review or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity. 
• 
There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to 
compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to 
each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the 
Administrator. 
The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive 
discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will 
pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination. 
ll Page 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 13 of 20
• 
All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to 
race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To 
ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process 
so that all Claimants can equally access the Program's claim process. Individuals 
with disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their 
claims and to request special process accommodations. 
The Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were 
harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they 
have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. 
The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date ("Filing Deadline"). All 
individual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period. 
To complement the Program's resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent 
of the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert, 
leading legal academic and advocate of victims' rights. Ms. Hamilton's role will be to further inform the 
Administrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse, 
and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or 
updating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in 
interactions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-
determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. 
The 
Administrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant's prior written consent, request that Ms. 
Hamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in 
her discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants' files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton. 
As set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration 
of the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims 
submitted to the Program. 
During the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her 
representatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton 
will maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains 
through her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants' submissions.

II. 
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 
A. Eligibility Criteria 
The persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused 
by Epstein. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
• 
The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein. 
• 
An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may 
participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met. 
• 
An individual who previously entered into a settlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual 
abuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are 
met. 
• 
An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may 
participate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual 
acted under duress as a result of her own sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other 
eligibility criteria are met. 
• 
If the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with 
prejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities 
and/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or 
prior to the signed acceptance of the compensation determination offer letter and executed 
Release in order to receive payment. 
B. Legal Representatives of Claimants 
An individual may file a claim on a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority 
to act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The "Legal Representative" of an 
individual Claimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal 
guardian authorized by law to serve as the minor's legal representative; (2) in the case of an 
incompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's 
legal representative in accordance with applicable law; {3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person 
who has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's estate by a court of 
competent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an attorney authorized to 
represent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program. 
Legal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such 
proof may include a power of attorney; documentation showing the individual's appointment as 
guardian or guardian ad litem; documentation showing the individual's appointment as personal 
representative of the Claimant's estate (such as letters of administration); a copy of a retainer 
3I Page 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 15 of 20
agreement showing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the attorney or a signed 
statement by an adult Claimant and the attorney that a licensed/admitted attorney is acting on her 
behalf. 
Ill. 
CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION ANO DETERMINATION 
A. Claims Submission Process 
Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the 
Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions 
for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed 
a lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to 
be eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain 
free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals 
must, however, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at 
the time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment. 
Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
not otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before 
the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at 
www.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire setting forth their 
name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested 
information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the 
individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is 
eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant 
Program information. 
Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates 
that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It 
does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive 
compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has 
been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. 
Registrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the 
Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their attorney to the 
Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective 
Date through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline ("Registration Deadline"). It is important 
to note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained 
above, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline. 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 16 of 20
All Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant's ability and filed no later than the Filing 
Deadline. Claim Forms should be uploaded to the Program website at www.EpsteinVCP.com. or mailed 
via overnight courier (a pre-paid courier voucher will be included with each packet) to the Administrator 
at the following address: 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
Attn: Jordana H. Feldman, Administrator 
P.O. Box 65488 
Washington, D.C. 20035 
Claimants are invited to provide documentation identified in the Claim Form, and any other 
corroborating or supporting information sufficient to substantiate the claim, satisfy eligibility 
requirements, and allow the Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. If the claim is 
being presented by a Legal Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for 
submitting the necessary documentation relating to the represented Claimant. 
Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant 
and the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed 
relevant to the Administrator's evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator's 
final disposition of the claim. 
If a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant, 
explain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant's legal 
Representative (where applicable) to assist in submitting a complete claim. 
B. Claims Evaluation and Determination 
Claims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each 
submitted individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all 
required documentation has been submitted to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to 
Claimant's good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation. 
1. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will 
consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
• 
The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the 
nature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the 
age of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include 
(i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and 
(ii) contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the 
abuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others. 
The 
Administrator acknowledges that some Claimants may not be able to provide any 
SI Page 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 17 of 20
documentation to corroborate their Claim based on the nature and circumstances of Epstein's 
conduct. If a Claimant's written and oral presentation is deemed to be credible by the 
Administrator, the Claimant may still be eligible for compensation under the Program. 
• 
Whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate 
Office of the District Attorney, United States Attorney's Office, or other law enforcement 
agency. 
• 
Whether the Administrator finds the claims of the individual to be credible after complete 
review of all relevant documentation and other evidence provided by the Claimant and the 
Estate. 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, the amount of compensation that should be offered to each eligible Claimant. 
The Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited 
to: 
• 
The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the Claimant. 
• 
The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse. 
• 
The nature and extent of the Claimant's physical or psychological damage resulting from the 
sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual abuse on the Claimant. 
• 
The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and circumstances, supporting 
documentation and corroborating evidence. 
• 
Whether the Claimant previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and 
received a payment pursuant to such agreement. 
The Administrator will confidentially send the Claimant a compensation determination offer letter 
including the following: (1) the Administrator's eligibility decision regarding the claim; (2) the amount of 
compensation offered; (3) a Release to be signed by the Claimant if the Claimant accepts the offered 
compensation; and (4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer shall be valid for 60 days from 
the date of the compensation determination offer letter. 
The Administrator's determinations in this Program will not be binding on any potential criminal 
investigation involving Claimant's claims. 
2. Opportunities to be Heard 
The Claimant will be afforded an opportunity to be heard, either before or after the Administrator 
renders her determination. Upon request by the Claimant, the Administrator will be available to meet in 
person (as practicable in light of the COVI0-19 pandemic), by video conference, or by teleconference to 
further discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet 
GI Page 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 18 of 20
with the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be 
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting 
with a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location, 
though the Claimant is not obligated to attend any such meeting. 
3. Release 
By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations 
of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the 
Release. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the 
Claimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all 
past and future claims (including /is pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of 
sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the 
offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time 
prior to the execution of the Release. 
The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries 
may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related 
entities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to 
participate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However, 
the Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant's ability to report and discuss 
allegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. 
In other words, the 
Release will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permitted to 
discuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose. 
Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney selected by the Claimant. If the 
Claimant is not represented by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal 
counseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and 
binding nature of the Release. 
No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under 
the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding 
tax liability for payments pursuant to the Program. 
4. Payments 
Upon the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's receipt of 
the Claimant's executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing 
lawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the 
Administrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as 
directed by the Claimant. 
Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. 
All 
payments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant's physical injuries, physical sickness and 
Page 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 19 of 20
resulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section 104(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
C. Program Integrity 
For the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible 
Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent 
claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies, 
irregularities or duplication. 
Each Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information 
provided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the 
Claimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may 
result in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be 
potentially fraudulent or to contain information known by the Claimant to be false when made will be 
forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the 
District Attorney and/or United States Attorney's Office for possible investigation and prosecution. 
D. Confidentiality/Privacy 
The Program is confidential. 1 By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal 
Representative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by the Claimant pursuant to 
the Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the 
following purposes: 
I) Processing and evaluating the Claimant's claim; 
2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and 
3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims. 
When documents or other information maintained or submitted by the Estate become part of a 
Claimant's file for purposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to 
assist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. No information 
provided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant's name and the date(s) 
and location{s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and, 
for purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant 
alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained 
solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any 
claim, regardless of forum. The Program's files are not available for inspection, review or copying by 
the Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent 
mediation privileges, settlement privileges and other privileges apply. 
All parties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of individual claims 
of sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, settlement and all other pertinent 
privileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law. 
SI Page 

Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 63     Filed 06/01/20     Page 20 of 20
To protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by 
the Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of 
the Program. 
Individual Claimants are not bound through the Program by any rules of confidentiality. Claimants may, 
at their sole and voluntary option, disclose information in their possession regarding their claim, their 
compensation and their experience with the Program. 
All confidentiality requirements are subject to law, regulation and judicial process. 
E. Reporting 
The Administrator shall, on a monthly basis, confidentially provide reports regarding the number and 
total value of claims paid each month to the Probate Court of the United States Virgin Islands and the 
Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands. Such reports will report on an aggregate level 
only. No individual Claimant information will be published or disclosed in a way that compromises 
Claimant confidentiality.

COURT CLERK 
1At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences 
concerning the proposed compensation program. which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including 
claimants' counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that "(b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the support of claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining 
impediments have been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol."' they and the Attorney 
General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts 
owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program's active operations, including payment of compensation 
determinations to eligible claimants. Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program and 
Presentation of Program Protocol, at 6, June I. 2020.
