DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
OFFICE OF 
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REPORT 
Investigation into the  
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s  
Resolution of Its 2006–2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of  
Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation 
November 2020 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
investigated allegations that in 2007-2008, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA).  The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged 
in illegal sexual activity with girls.1  OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed 
professional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was 
signed or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.   
I. 
OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein 
in 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.  
Epstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and 
other United States and foreign locations.  The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used 
personal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those 
massages led to sexual activity.  After the PBPD brought the case to the State Attorney’s Office, a 
Palm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July 19, 2006, for felony solicitation of 
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07.  However, because the PBPD Chief and the 
lead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s handling of the case and believed that 
the state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the 
matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal 
investigation.  
The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor’s approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta.  
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course 
of the investigation, they discovered additional victims.  In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her 
supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein.  She also provided a 
lengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and 
addressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges. 
For several weeks following submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed 
indictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine how to proceed.  At a July 31, 
2007 meeting with Epstein’s attorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled 
guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a 
sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary 
damages.  The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with 
Epstein’s team of attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the 
federal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007.  The 
As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who 
were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged conduct.   Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age 
of 18. 

ii 
NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against 
him and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require 
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03.  The NPA required Epstein to make a binding 
recommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed 
by 12 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”).  The NPA also included 
provisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein.  In 
exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in 
the Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential 
co-conspirators.”  Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or 
the NPA prior to its signing.         
The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration, 
however.  For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys 
to try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously 
seeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no 
federal interest at issue and the matter should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement 
officials.  Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials, 
defense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms.  They also sought and 
obtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a 
quintessentially state matter.”  After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on 
June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General informed defense counsel that the 
Deputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter.  Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill 
his obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to 
the pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA, 
to a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.  
Upon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the 
court immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of 12 months’ incarceration on the 
solicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months 
of community control.  Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm 
Beach County facility.  A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.          
On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern 
District of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated  the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein 
without consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.2  In responding to 
the petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did 
not produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective 
order; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.  After the initial filings and 
hearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil 
cases against Epstein.  
Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771, 
Doe v. United States, Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2008).  Another victim subsequently joined 
the litigation as “Jane Doe 2.” 

iii 
 Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work 
release program, and the Sheriff approved his application.  In October 2008, Epstein began 
spending 12 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity 
Epstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of 
Epstein’s attorneys.  Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein 
received “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months 
of incarceration.  On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home 
detention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts 
for release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge 
in September 2009 ordered it to be made public.   
By mid-2010, Epstein reportedly settled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by 
victims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation.  During 
the CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial 
document productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and 
submitted declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal 
investigation.  The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was 
permitted to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues.  Nevertheless, the court 
ultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case 
be made public.  During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting 
the CVRA.  After failed efforts to settle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment 
remained pending for more than a year.     
In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor.  At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.  On  
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.    
In the decade following his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to 
settle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims.  Epstein was otherwise able 
to resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.  On November 28, 2018, 
however, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal 
criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced 
girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.3  The Miami Herald 
reported that in 2007, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the 
NPA, which permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison 
sentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.”  According to the Miami 
Herald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and 
concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.  Through its reporting, which included 
interviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper 
painted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a 
wealthy man with powerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime” 
that allowed him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his

iv 
abuse of minors.  The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the 
government’s actions.4    
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the 
victims about its intention to enter into the NPA.5  The court also found that letters the government 
sent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic] 
the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.”  The court also highlighted 
the inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time 
engaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA 
would not be “made public or filed with the court.”  The court ordered the parties to submit 
additional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies.  After the court’s order, the Department 
recused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Northern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government.  Among the remedies sought 
by the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal 
prosecution of Epstein.     
On July 2, 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained 
a federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and 
one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.  The indictment alleged that from 
2002 until 2005, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida 
whom he sexually abused and exploited.  Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2019.  In 
arguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s 
Manhattan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least 
one believed to be a minor.  The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded 
to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
Manhattan.   
Meanwhile, after publication of the November 2018 Miami Herald report, the media and 
Congress increasingly focused attention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the 
NPA.  On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s 
actions.  Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office “was ready to allow Epstein to 
walk free with no jail time, nothing.”  According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered 
this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a 
resolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims 
with the means to obtain monetary damages.  Acosta’s press conference did not end the 
controversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as

Marra).    

v 
Secretary of Labor.  In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on 
his handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor 
Department.   
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.  
The New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed suicide.   
As a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of  
New York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein.  On  
August 27, 2019, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s 
victims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke 
about the impact of Epstein’s crimes.  The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on  
August 29, 2019.  
After Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation 
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.  Among its findings, 
the court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had 
asserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had 
not litigated in bad faith.  The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its 
representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper 
treatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.   
On September 30, 2019, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe 1” filed in her true name a petition 
for a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking 
review of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies.  In its responsive brief, 
the government argued that “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern 
District of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.”  Nevertheless, during oral 
argument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the 
petitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in 
fact the NPA had been signed.”  On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied 
the petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not attach until a defendant has been criminally charged.  
On August 7, 2020, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s 
opinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set 
for December 3, 2020.  
II. 
THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION 
After the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2018,  
U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency 
Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2018 letter to OPR, citing the Miami 
Herald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this 
reporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice attorneys.”  On February 6, 2019, the 
Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened 

vi 
an investigation into the matter and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through the NPA.6  
After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR 
included within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that 
formed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford 
victims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was 
signed and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal 
investigation. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of 
the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  
The records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected 
and reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein.  OPR also 
examined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and 
other court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books 
relating to the Epstein case.      
In addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews 
of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel; 
current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior 
managers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General 
for the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in 
charge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys 
representing victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and the FBI.   
OPR identified former U.S. Attorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the 
AUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of 
them was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations 
leading to the agreement.  OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of 
its investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result 
in a finding of professional misconduct.  OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta 
and another subject.  All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation.  OPR requested 
that all of the subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement in the federal 
investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim 
notification and consultation.  OPR received and reviewed written responses from all of the 
subjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before 
a court reporter.  Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant 
contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.  The subjects reviewed and 
provided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.  OPR 
The federal government was closed from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019.  After initiating its 
investigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the 
status of the OPR investigation. 

vii 
carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed 
appropriate; OPR did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions.      
Finally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and 
attorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case 
and to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct. 
As part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the 
federal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state 
officials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state 
investigation.7  Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department attorneys adhere to the 
standards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject 
attorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal 
behavior.  Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his 
assistants’ conduct as it was known to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as 
Department attorneys.  Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008, 
when Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to 
that date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent 
information.   
OPR’s investigation occurred approximately 12 years after most of the significant events 
relating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.  As a result, 
many of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their own or 
others’ actions occurring in 2006-2008, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they 
reviewed at the time.8  However, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly 
by extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the 
government and defense counsel.  These records often referred to the interactions among the 
participants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.      
III. 
OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
OPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in 
accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal 
law enforcement agency.  Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct 
against current or former Department attorneys related to the exercise of their authority to 
In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.  As reported, the 
investigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.   
OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution 
of, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2019.  Moreover, as the line prosecutor in 
the Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that 
litigation in early 2019, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions 
to review these materials in the course of her official duties.  Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a written 
response, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these 
materials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in 
preparation for their interviews.  

viii 
investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.9    OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations 
of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department 
attorney’s alleged professional misconduct.   
In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs 
the challenged conduct and whether a subject attorney violated that standard.  Department 
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of 
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by attorney 
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies.  OPR finds misconduct when it 
concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a standard 
intentionally or recklessly.  Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that 
(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the 
subject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct.  In some cases, OPR may conclude 
that a subject attorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional 
misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding.  In such cases, OPR may 
conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted 
inappropriately under the circumstances.  OPR may also determine that the subject attorney’s 
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.10   
IV. 
ISSUES CONSIDERED 
In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations.  The first relates to 
the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA.  The second relates to the USAO’s 
interactions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA.  The two sets 
of issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report. 
A. 
The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA 
In evaluating whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR 
considered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute, 
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy.  In particular, OPR 
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination 
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants 
C.F.R. § 0.39a(a)(1).  OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring 
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during 
OPR’s investigation.  Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department 
attorneys.  Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that 
a former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an 
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority.  Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct 
of Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.   
In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after 
a preliminary inquiry into the matter.  In December 2010, one of the attorneys representing victims in the CVRA 
litigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation 
and that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA.  Pursuant to its 
standard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the 
then-pending CVRA litigation.   

ix 
of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens.  The potentially applicable standards that 
OPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report.  OPR 
also examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter 
into the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive, 
such as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism.  OPR also examined and 
discusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed 
that shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation. 
B. 
The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA 
To address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content, 
and timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was 
signed, including victim notification letters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews 
conducted by the USAO.  OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear 
and unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification.  OPR examined the 
government’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the 
circumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s 
victims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
V. 
OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in 
various decisions and events.  Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of 
the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led 
to the NPA.  Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved 
it, with knowledge of its terms.  During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved 
the NPA and accepted responsibility for it.  Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for 
the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions.  Acosta’s overall 
responsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less 
clear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR 
evaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.  
A. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA 
With respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects 
did not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and 
approval of the NPA.  Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a 
subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing 
the conduct at issue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict 
Epstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.  
Furthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable 
standards.  
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.  Acosta’s decision to decline to 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not

find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations.  Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one 
of Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution.  Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.  Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances.  In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     
B. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with 
Victims  
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims.  The subjects did not have 
a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the 
NPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal 
charge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA 
rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not 
established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were 
brought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose 
of silencing victims.  Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s 

xi 
treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the 
Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.  
OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.  
Moreover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims.     
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights 
requirements.  Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.  
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims’ attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct.  
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims.  Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      
After examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The 
overall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes 
that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.

VI. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT 
The Report is divided into three chapters.  In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant 
federal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal 
conduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.  
OPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with 
the subjects.     
In Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal 
investigation of Epstein.  The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young 
victim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law 
enforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2006 opening of the federal 
investigation; the September 2007 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent 
efforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2008 
guilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with 
the terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July 
2010.  After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations 
relating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA.  OPR 
describes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’ 
conduct.  
Chapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s 
findings regarding the CVRA.  OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’ 
conduct in light of the pertinent standards.    
OPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including 
internal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full 
understanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.

 REPORT 
Investigation into the  
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s  
Resolution of Its 2006–2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of  
Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation 
November 2020 
NOTE:  THIS REPORT CONTAINS SENSITIVE, PRIVILEGED, AND PRIVACY 
ACT PROTECTED INFORMATION.  DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE REPORT OR

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
investigated allegations that in 2007-2008, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA).  The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged 
in illegal sexual activity with girls.1  OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed 
professional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was 
signed or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.   
I. 
OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein 
in 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.  
Epstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and 
other United States and foreign locations.  The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used 
personal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those 
massages led to sexual activity.  After the PBPD brought the case to the State Attorney’s Office, a 
Palm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July 19, 2006, for felony solicitation of 
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07.  However, because the PBPD Chief and the 
lead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s handling of the case and believed that 
the state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the 
matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal 
investigation.  
The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor’s approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta.  
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course 
of the investigation, they discovered additional victims.  In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her 
supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein.  She also provided a 
lengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and 
addressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges. 
For several weeks following submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed 
indictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine how to proceed.  At a  
July 31, 2007 meeting with Epstein’s attorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if 
Epstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, 
registered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain 
monetary damages.  The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications 
with Epstein’s team of attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the 
federal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007.  The 
As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who 
were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged conduct.   Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age 
of 18. 

ii 
NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against 
him and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require 
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03.  The NPA required Epstein to make a binding 
recommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed 
by 12 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”).  The NPA also included 
provisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein.  In 
exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in 
the Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential 
co-conspirators.”  Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or 
the NPA prior to its signing.         
The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration, 
however.  For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys 
to try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously 
seeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no 
federal interest at issue and the matter should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement 
officials.  Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials, 
defense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms.  They also sought and 
obtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a 
quintessentially state matter.”  After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on 
June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General informed defense counsel that the 
Deputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter.  Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill 
his obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to 
the pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA, 
to a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.  
Upon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the 
court immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of 12 months’ incarceration on the 
solicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months 
of community control.  Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm 
Beach County facility.  A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.          
On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern 
District of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated  the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein 
without consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.2  In responding to 
the petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did 
not produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective 
order; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.  After the initial filings and 
hearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil 
cases against Epstein.  
Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771, 
Doe v. United States, Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2008).  Another victim subsequently joined 
the litigation as “Jane Doe 2.” 

iii 
Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work 
release program, and the Sheriff approved his application.  In October 2008, Epstein began 
spending 12 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity 
Epstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of 
Epstein’s attorneys.  Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein 
received “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months 
of incarceration.  On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home 
detention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts 
for release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge 
in September 2009 ordered it to be made public.   
By mid-2010, Epstein reportedly settled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by 
victims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation.  During 
the CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial 
document productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and 
submitted declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal 
investigation.  The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was 
permitted to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues.  Nevertheless, the court 
ultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case 
be made public.  During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting 
the CVRA.  After failed efforts to settle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment 
remained pending for more than a year.     
In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor.  At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.  On  
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.    
In the decade following his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to 
settle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims.  Epstein was otherwise able 
to resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.  On November 28, 2018, 
however, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal 
criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced 
girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.3  The Miami Herald 
reported that in 2007, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the 
NPA, which permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison 
sentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.”  According to the Miami 
Herald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and 
concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.  Through its reporting, which included 
interviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper 
painted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a 
wealthy man with powerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime” 
that allowed him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his

iv 
abuse of minors.  The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the 
government’s actions.4    
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the 
victims about its intention to enter into the NPA.5  The court also found that letters the government 
sent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic] 
the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.”  The court also highlighted 
the inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time 
engaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA 
would not be “made public or filed with the court.”  The court ordered the parties to submit 
additional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies.  After the court’s order, the Department 
recused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Northern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government.  Among the remedies sought 
by the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal 
prosecution of Epstein.     
On July 2, 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained 
a federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and 
one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.  The indictment alleged that from 
2002 until 2005, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida 
whom he sexually abused and exploited.  Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2019.  In 
arguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s 
Manhattan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least 
one believed to be a minor.  The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded 
to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
Manhattan.   
Meanwhile, after publication of the November 2018 Miami Herald report, the media and 
Congress increasingly focused attention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the 
NPA.  On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s 
actions.  Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office “was ready to allow Epstein to 
walk free with no jail time, nothing.”  According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered 
this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a 
resolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims 
with the means to obtain monetary damages.  Acosta’s press conference did not end the 
controversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as

v 
Secretary of Labor.  In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on 
his handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor 
Department.   
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.  
The New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed suicide.   
As a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of  
New York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein.  On  
August 27, 2019, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s 
victims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke 
about the impact of Epstein’s crimes.  The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on  
August 29, 2019.  
After Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation 
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.  Among its findings, 
the court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had 
asserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had 
not litigated in bad faith.  The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its 
representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper 
treatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.   
On September 30, 2019, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe 1” filed in her true name a petition 
for a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking 
review of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies.  In its responsive brief, 
the government argued that “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern 
District of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.”  Nevertheless, during oral 
argument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the 
petitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in 
fact the NPA had been signed.”  On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied 
the petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not attach until a defendant has been criminally charged.  
On August 7, 2020, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s 
opinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set 
for December 3, 2020.  
II. 
THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION 
After the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2018,  
U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency 
Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2018 letter to OPR, citing the Miami 
Herald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this 
reporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice attorneys.”  On February 6, 2019, the 
Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened 

vi 
an investigation into the matter and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through the NPA.6  
After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR 
included within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that 
formed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford 
victims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was 
signed and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal 
investigation. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of 
the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  
The records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected 
and reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein.  OPR also 
examined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and 
other court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books 
relating to the Epstein case.      
In addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews 
of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel; 
current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior 
managers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General 
for the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in 
charge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys 
representing victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and the FBI.   
OPR identified former U.S. Attorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the 
AUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of 
them was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations 
leading to the agreement.  OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of 
its investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result 
in a finding of professional misconduct.  OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta 
and another subject.  All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation.  OPR requested 
that all of the subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement in the federal 
investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim 
notification and consultation.  OPR received and reviewed written responses from all of the 
subjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before 
a court reporter.  Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant 
contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.  The subjects reviewed and 
provided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.  OPR 
The federal government was closed from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019.  After initiating its 
investigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the 
status of the OPR investigation. 

vii 
carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed 
appropriate; OPR did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions.      
Finally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and 
attorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case 
and to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct. 
As part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the 
federal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state 
officials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state 
investigation.7  Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department attorneys adhere to the 
standards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject 
attorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal 
behavior.  Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his 
assistants’ conduct as it was known to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as 
Department attorneys.  Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008, 
when Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to 
that date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent 
information.   
OPR’s investigation occurred approximately 12 years after most of the significant events 
relating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.  As a result, 
many of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their own or 
others’ actions occurring in 2006-2008, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they 
reviewed at the time.8  However, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly 
by extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the 
government and defense counsel.  These records often referred to the interactions among the 
participants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.      
III. 
OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
OPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in 
accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal 
law enforcement agency.  Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct 
against current or former Department attorneys related to the exercise of their authority to 
In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.  As reported, the 
investigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.   
OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution 
of, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2019.  Moreover, as the line prosecutor in 
the Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that 
litigation in early 2019, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions 
to review these materials in the course of her official duties.  Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a written 
response, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these 
materials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in 
preparation for their interviews.  

viii 
investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.9    OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations 
of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department 
attorney’s alleged professional misconduct.   
In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs 
the challenged conduct and whether a subject attorney violated that standard.  Department 
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of 
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by attorney 
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies.  OPR finds misconduct when it 
concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a standard 
intentionally or recklessly.  Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that 
(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the 
subject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct.  In some cases, OPR may conclude 
that a subject attorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional 
misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding.  In such cases, OPR may 
conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted 
inappropriately under the circumstances.  OPR may also determine that the subject attorney’s 
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.10   
IV. 
ISSUES CONSIDERED 
In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations.  The first relates to 
the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA.  The second relates to the USAO’s 
interactions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA.  The two sets 
of issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report. 
A. 
The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA 
In evaluating whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR 
considered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute, 
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy.  In particular, OPR 
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination 
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants 
C.F.R. § 0.39a(a)(1).  OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring 
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during 
OPR’s investigation.  Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department 
attorneys.  Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that 
a former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an 
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority.  Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct 
of Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.   
In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after 
a preliminary inquiry into the matter.  In December 2010, one of the attorneys representing victims in the CVRA 
litigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation 
and that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA.  Pursuant to its 
standard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the 
then-pending CVRA litigation.   

ix 
of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens.  The potentially applicable standards that 
OPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report.  OPR 
also examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter 
into the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive, 
such as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism.  OPR also examined and 
discusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed 
that shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation. 
B. 
The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA 
To address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content, 
and timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was 
signed, including victim notification letters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews 
conducted by the USAO.  OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear 
and unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification.  OPR examined the 
government’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the 
circumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s 
victims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
V. 
OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in 
various decisions and events.  Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of 
the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led 
to the NPA.  Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved 
it, with knowledge of its terms.  During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved 
the NPA and accepted responsibility for it.  Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for 
the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions.  Acosta’s overall 
responsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less 
clear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR 
evaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.  
A. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA 
With respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects 
did not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and 
approval of the NPA.  Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a 
subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing 
the conduct at issue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict 
Epstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.  
Furthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable 
standards.  
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.  Acosta’s decision to decline to 

x 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not 
find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations.  Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one 
of Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution.  Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.  Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances.  In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     
B. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with 
Victims  
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims.  The subjects did not have 
a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the 
NPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal 
charge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA 
rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not 
established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were 
brought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose 
of silencing victims.  Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government 

xi 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s 
treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the 
Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.  
OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.  
Moreover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims.     
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights 
requirements.  Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.  
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims’ attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct.  
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims.  Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      
After examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The 
overall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes 

xii 
that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.   
VI. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT 
The Report is divided into three chapters.  In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant 
federal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal 
conduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.  
OPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with 
the subjects.     
In Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal 
investigation of Epstein.  The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young 
victim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law 
enforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2006 opening of the federal 
investigation; the September 2007 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent 
efforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2008 
guilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with 
the terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July 
2010.  After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations 
relating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA.  OPR 
describes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’ 
conduct.  
Chapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s 
findings regarding the CVRA.  OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’ 
conduct in light of the pertinent standards.    
OPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including 
internal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full 
understanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.

CHAPTER ONE 
SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS 
I. 
THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
A. 
The Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
The Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department 
headed by the United States Attorney General.  The stated mission of the Department is to enforce 
federal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal 
leadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful 
behavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice.  The Department enforces 
federal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal 
statutes.  It also engages in civil litigation.  During the period relevant to this Report, the 
Department had approximately 110,000 employees in 40 components.  The Department’s 
headquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations 
around the nation and overseas. 
The prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Attorney’s 
Offices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate) 
U.S. Attorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Attorney 
General through the Deputy Attorney General.1  The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by 
an Assistant Attorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also 
prosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Attorney’s Offices, and provide legal 
expertise and policy guidance.  Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this 
Report are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and 
Intellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section 
(CEOS). 
CEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises attorneys and investigators who specialize 
in investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology, 
and they assist U.S. Attorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these 
offenses.  CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel, 
and government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution 
policies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.  
 The U.S. Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2018 and renamed the Justice Manual) 
is a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department 
employees.  It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division 
Two U.S. Attorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are 
headed by a single U.S. Attorney.  The Attorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting 
and interim U.S. Attorneys.   

or other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal enforcement, such as the Civil Rights 
Division.  In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.     
During the period most relevant to this Report, the Attorney General was Michael 
Mukasey, the Deputy Attorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Attorney General for 
the Criminal Division was Alice Fisher.  The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterbaan.    
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal 
matters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-
Dade, Broward, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and 
Highlands, an area of over 15,000 square miles.  During the period relevant to this Report, the 
USAO had a staff of approximately 200 Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) and 200 support 
personnel.  The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale, 
West Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office 
is located in Key West.  The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 70 miles from the 
Miami office.  The USAO is headed by the U.S. Attorney; the second-in-command is the First 
Assistant U.S. Attorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Attorney and 
supervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions, 
each of which is headed by a Chief.  During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm 
Beach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.    
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency 
and is part of the Department.  It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Attorney’s Offices.  
The FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, known 
as Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.  
The Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach 
Resident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.  FBI responsibility for advising 
crime victims of their rights and of victim services available to them is handled by non-agent 
Victim Specialists.

B. 
The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies 
Florida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Attorney 
in each of the state’s 20 judicial circuits, headed by a State Attorney who is elected to a four-year 
term.  Palm Beach County constitutes the 15th Judicial Circuit.  Barry Krischer was the elected 
State Attorney for that circuit from 1992 until January 2009.  During the period relevant to this 
Report, the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach, 
had more than 100 attorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed 
by Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek.     
The incorporated Town of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of 
West Palm Beach.  Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).  
Michael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in 1981, served as PBPD Chief from 2001 to February 2009. 
The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is 
the largest law enforcement agency in the county.  Through its Department of Corrections, the 
PBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed 
minimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility.  The current 
Sheriff has served continuously since January 2005. 
II. 
THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE 
R. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida in June 2005, at age 36.  In June 2006, President George W. Bush formally nominated 
Acosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney in October 2006.   
After graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an 18-month 
term as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years 
as a policy fellow and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General in the Department’s Civil Rights Division.  He was presidentially appointed in 2002 as a 
member of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2003 as Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2003 until his 
appointment as Interim U.S. Attorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution 
of human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases.  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta’s office was in the 
USAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.   
During Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Attorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of 
Epstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-
prosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report.  Acosta made the decision to 
resolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allowing Epstein to enter a state plea.  
Acosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations 
of the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO.  Acosta continued to 
provide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s 
attorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007, 
and Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 30, 
2008.  On December 8, 2008, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state 
prison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all matters involving the law firm of 

Kirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the 
firm about possible employment.    
After leaving the USAO in June 2009, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International 
University College of Law.  In April 2017, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he 
resigned from that post effective July 19, 2019, following public criticism of the USAO’s handling 
of the Epstein case.   
Jeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in 1990 as a line AUSA.  In 2001, he became Deputy 
Chief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in 
2003, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office.  In early 2004, Sloman was appointed 
Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division.  In October 2006, Sloman became the FAUSA, and 
Sloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.   
As FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate 
Divisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.  
Although Sloman had relatively little involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the 
NPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA, 
which he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2007.  After subordinates Matthew Menchel 
and Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafaña, 
on Epstein matters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.  
After Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein matter in December 2008, Sloman became 
the senior USAO official supervising the matter.  When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became 
the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2010, the Attorney 
General appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Attorney for the district.  Sloman left the USAO 
to enter private practice in June 2010. 
Matthew I. Menchel joined the USAO in 1998 after having served as a New York County 
(Manhattan) Assistant District Attorney for 11 years.  After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel 
became Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section.  In October 2006, Menchel became the Chief 
of the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami.  As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was 
part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings 
and other communications with defense counsel.  Menchel participated in the decision to extend a 
two-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense.  Shortly after 
that plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2007, and before the precise terms of the 
NPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.   
Andrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in 1994, after having served for three 
years as an AUSA in New Jersey.  During his 13-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two 
terms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity 
Section, first from September 2001 until September 2002, and then from February 2006 until July 
2006.  Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2006, Lourie was 
a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West 
Palm Beach branch office.  Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein 
investigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with 
defense counsel.  During September 2007, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie 
transitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General 

for the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant 
Attorney General Alice Fisher.  Lourie left the Department in February 2008 to enter private 
practice.  
Ann Marie C. Villafaña joined the USAO in September 2001 as a line AUSA.  She served 
in the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2004, when she transferred to the West Palm 
Beach branch office.  Villafaña handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm 
Beach, along with other criminal matters.  In 2006, she was designated as the USAO’s first 
coordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual 
exploitation and abuse.2   
In 2006, Villafaña assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation.  As the line AUSA, 
Villafaña handled all aspects of the investigation.  Villafaña determined the lines of inquiry to 
pursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible 
charges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department.  Villafaña, along 
with the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.  
She handled court proceedings related to the investigation.  She drafted a prosecution 
memorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to 
comments from those in her supervisory chain of command.  Villafaña participated in meetings 
between members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for 
management in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those 
meetings.  Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve 
the federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafaña was the primary USAO 
representative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her 
supervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO.  Thereafter, 
Villafaña monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his 
conduct.  After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights 
under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (“the CVRA litigation” or “the 
CVRA case”), in July 2008, Villafaña served as co-counsel to the lead attorney representing the 
USAO until February 2019, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.3  Villafaña 
left the USAO in August 2019 to join another federal government agency.  
The following chart shows the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO 
personnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.
Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2006 to combat the 
growing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.  Led by the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices 
and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute 
individuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  
After the district court issued its February 21, 2019 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government, 
the Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.

III. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS 
A. 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Jeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1953.4  Although he did not graduate 
from college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhattan 
from 1974 until 1976.  Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street 
firm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited 
partner before leaving in 1981.  An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear, 
Epstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur 
through whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtown Manhattan, where he resided.  In the early 
1990s, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida.  He also owned a private island 
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France.  He traveled 
among his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.   
Epstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other 
entities, in numerous locations.  Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and 
extent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.5  He associated with 
prominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and 
engaged in substantial philanthropy.  Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including 
housekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom 
traveled with him.    
B. 
Epstein’s Defense Attorneys 
Jeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense attorneys in responding to the 
allegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach, 
Florida estate.  As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the 
allegations, he added attorneys having particular relevant knowledge of, or connections with, those 
entities.  At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami 
criminal trial attorney Roy Black.  He was also represented by a local criminal defense attorney 
who was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney, and by nationally prominent 
Harvard Law School professor and criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who was a self-
described close friend of Epstein.  After initial plea negotiations with the State Attorney’s Office, 
Epstein replaced the local attorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal 
defense attorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Attorney handling the 
Epstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Attorney was removed from the 
Epstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest.  Another prominent attorney who began 
representing Epstein during the state investigation was New York City attorney Gerald Lefcourt, 
Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.  See, e.g., Landon Thomas 
Jr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2002; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr. 
Epstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2003; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and 
Lurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2019; Lisette Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Façade Finally Cracks,” 
Forbes, July 12, 2019.  
After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and 
trust documents.  https://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.    

whose law firm website cites his “national reputation for the aggressive defense” of “high-profile 
defendants in criminal matters.”      
In late 2006, after the USAO opened its investigation, Epstein hired Miami criminal 
defense attorneys who were former AUSAs.  One, Guy Lewis, had also served as the U.S. 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and as Director of the Department’s Executive Office 
for United States Attorneys, the component charged with providing close liaison between the 
Department and the U.S. Attorneys.  Another, Lilly Ann Sanchez, had served in the USAO and 
as a Deputy Chief in the Major Crimes Section before leaving in 2005.  In August 2007, 
immediately after the USAO offered the terms that ultimately led to the NPA, two attorneys from 
the firm of Kirkland & Ellis, one of the largest law firms in the country, contacted the USAO on 
Epstein’s behalf:  Kenneth Starr, former federal judge and Solicitor General, who was serving as 
Dean of Pepperdine University School of Law while of counsel to the firm; and Jay Lefkowitz, a 
litigation partner who had served in high-level positions in the administrations of Presidents 
George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.  They were joined by nationally prominent Boston 
criminal defense attorney Martin Weinberg.  After the NPA was signed, former U.S. Attorney 
Joe D. Whitley joined the defense team, as did the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS and 
another former U.S. Attorney, who was also a retired federal judge.

CHAPTER TWO 
THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT  
PART ONE:  FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
In the following sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
details the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the 
negotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the 
NPA from taking effect.  OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled 
guilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement.  In describing 
events, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails.  In many 
instances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the 
issues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions.  When 
helpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations 
as provided in their written responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by 
witnesses. 
A timeline of key events is set forth on the following page. 
II. 
MARCH 2005 – MAY 2006:  EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM 
BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE 
ATTORNEY’S OFFICE 
A. 
The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation 
In March 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid 
their daughter $300 to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.6  The PBPD began 
investigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants, 
who were also implicated by the complainant.  The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial 
claim, to encompass allegations that during 2004 and 2005, Epstein, through his female assistants   
As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of 18.  Epstein’s contacts with girls and young 
women previously had come to the attention of the PBPD.  In March 2004, a PBPD officer documented a telephone 
complaint that a 17-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for 
$200 per massage.  The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered 
to cooperate with a police investigation.  The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as 
“unverified,” and it was not pursued.     
On November 28, 2004, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed 
coming and going from Epstein’s residence.  The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the 
PBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not 
investigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the matter.

and some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him 
massages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.    
Through their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.  
Some girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him.  The 
nature of the massages varied.  According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they 
massaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude.  Victims stated 
that during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself.  Some victims alleged that he touched 
them during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or 
through their clothing.  Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and 
some stated that he digitally penetrated them.  Some victims who stated that they saw him more 
often alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them.  According to one victim, an 
Epstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at 
Epstein’s direction.7   
Although the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent 
in describing a general pattern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants.  According to 
the information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled 
up to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment 
while Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences.  Typically, when a girl 
arrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and 
bathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils.  When 
the assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a towel.  After removing his 
clothing, Epstein lay face down and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her 
clothing, and then explained to her how he wished her to perform the massage.  During the 
massage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.  
When Epstein climaxed, the massage was over.  Usually, Epstein paid the girl $200 for the 
massage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact 
her in the future.  Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls 
interested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to 
perform a massage, each girl would receive $200.  Several of the victims acknowledged to the 
PBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.   
The evidence regarding Epstein’s knowledge of the girls’ ages was mixed.  Some girls who 
recruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were 
over 18 years old.  However, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages. 
Police were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flowers to her at her high school 
after she performed in a school play.  In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some 
of the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.    
Epstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning.  He retained local 
criminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators.  In October 2005, the PBPD, 
with the assistance of the State Attorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s 
residence.  When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 20, 2005, to execute the warrant, 
According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than 
this female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.  

they found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance 
cameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic 
storage media—were gone.  Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home, 
including notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a 
two-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments.  The police also found numerous 
photographs of naked young females of indeterminate age.  Police photographs taken of the interior 
of Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and 
master bedroom and bathroom area.  The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s 
high school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.  
B. 
The State Attorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury 
State Attorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that 
police brought the case to his office without having made an arrest.  Krischer was unfamiliar with 
Epstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit.  PBPD Chief Michael 
Reiter stated in a 2009 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State 
Attorney’s Office in 2005, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go 
for it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”  
Krischer told OPR, however, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that 
“there were witness problems.”   
Assistant State Attorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told 
OPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Attorney who initially worked with her on the 
case “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”  
According to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the 
elements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed, 
unlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.05(1)) and lewd and lascivious 
molestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 800.04(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”8  
In addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant, 
who could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation 
of sexual contact.  Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of 
probation, which he rejected.9 
Records publicly released by the State Attorney’s Office show that, beginning in early 
2006, attorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allow Epstein to plead “no 
contest” rather than guilty.  To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and 
presented the State Attorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of 
the victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as 
MySpace pages) about their own sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared 
to undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knowledge of victims’ ages.  Krischer 
Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge 
Epstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.   
In April 2006, the State Attorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree 
felony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation 
with no unsupervised contact with minors.     

told OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought attorney Alan Dershowitz to see Krischer and the 
Assistant State Attorney, but Dershowitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going 
to destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.”  According 
to Krischer, Dershowitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local attorney Jack 
Goldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.”  Because the husband of the 
Assistant State Attorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the Assistant State 
Attorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took 
over the case.  Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally known New York criminal 
defense attorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer 
to dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by attacking the credibility of the victim 
witnesses.   
Meanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the 
case to a grand jury.  Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2016, 
his office prosecuted minors as young as 14 for prostitution.10  The possibility that Epstein’s 
victims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and 
according to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.11  Belohlavek 
told OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an 
organized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we . . . 
thought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”  However, she said, although 
Epstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can 
charge.”  Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to 
my mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice 
was to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.   
C. 
Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges 
Federal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable 
by imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.12  
Under Florida law, however, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death 
penalty case.13  For all other cases, a State Attorney has concurrent authority to file criminal 
charges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.  
Although Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often 
utilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by 
public officials.14  Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among 
Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.   
Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Attorney’s Office’s 
handling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR 
his office’s prosecutive decisions. 
U.S. Const. amend. V; Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(a), (b).  The sole exception under the rule is felony criminal 
contempt, which need not be charged by indictment.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(a)(1).

other things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and 
proscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.15             
D. 
PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Attorney’s Office’s 
Handling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation  
In 2006, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s attitude had changed and, according 
to Reiter’s statements in his 2009 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were 
credible.  Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein 
to appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s 
objectivity and the State Attorney’s Office’s approach to the case.  As Reiter explained in his 
deposition: 
This was a case that I felt absolutely needed the attention of the State 
Attorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court.  It’s 
not generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court.  And I 
knew that it didn’t really matter what the facts were in this case, it 
was pretty clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute 
this case. 
On May 1, 2006, Reiter submitted to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing 
package relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein 
first victimized and then used to recruit other girls.  In his transmittal letter, which was later made 
public, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Attorney’s Office’s “treatment of 
these cases [to be] highly unusual.”16  Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that 
your office’s handling of this matter has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from 
prosecuting Epstein.17

THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE 
TEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO 
A. 
May 2006 – February 2007:  The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the 
USAO Opens a Case File 
In early 2006, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with 
AUSA Ann Marie Villafaña on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as 
“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafaña in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD 
was investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity.  The case 
agent told Villafaña that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Attorney’s Office 
was considering either not charging the case or allowing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor 
Fla. Stat. § 905.27 (2007). 
See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. 14, 2006. 
As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions; 
however, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that 
way.”    

charge.  Villafaña suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before 
formally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see how the State Attorney’s Office 
decided to charge Epstein.

The PBPD Presents the Matter to the FBI and the USAO 
In May 2006, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafaña and 
the FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s 
investigation.18  At the time, neither Villafaña nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any 
knowledge of his background.   
According to Villafaña, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure 
had been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s attorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were 
concerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.19  The Detective 
explained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had 
raised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated 
the removal of the Assistant State Attorney initially assigned to handle the matter, who was viewed 
as an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense attorney whose relationship with the Assistant 
State Attorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor.  Further, given the missing computer 
equipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been 
“tipped off” in advance about the search warrant.   
During the meeting, Villafaña reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could 
be brought against Epstein.  She focused on 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into 
prostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce 
to persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423 
(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct).  As they discussed these charges, the 
Detective told Villafaña that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach 
International Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to 
passengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references 
to underage girls.  However, the Detective acknowledged that he was unable to confirm that 
suspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate 
or internationally.  Nevertheless, Villafaña believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part 
because of his own interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse 
girls.  Villafaña discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed 
to prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified.  She told them that if the evidence 
supported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal 
investigation would not preclude the State Attorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it 
choose to do so.   
The Detective died in May 2018.   
In his 2009 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein matter to the FBI, a Town of Palm 
Beach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims 
were not believable and “Palm Beach solves its own problems.”

May 2006:  The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File   
On May 23, 2006, Villafaña prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file.  Villafaña 
told OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a 
federal prosecution:  (1) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate 
commerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that 
Epstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the 
computer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure 
had affected the State Attorney Office’s handling of the case.  The investigation was named 
“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as 
victims of Epstein’s conduct.20   
Villafaña told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that 
the case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and 
Epstein’s financial resources.  Nonetheless, Villafaña was willing to put in the effort and believed 
that the FBI was similarly committed to the case.  Villafaña discussed the case with her immediate 
supervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the 
USAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2006, it was formally initiated.   
3. 
July 14, 2006:  Villafaña Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case 
Because Villafaña was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and 
learned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation.  Villafaña was aware that Epstein 
had hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Attorney’s Office in an effort to derail the 
state case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal 
investigation.   
Therefore, Villafaña arranged to meet with U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey 
Sloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.21  Villafaña told OPR that she had never 
before asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that 
Epstein had improperly influenced the State Attorney’s Office greatly troubled her.  Villafaña 
explained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the 
Epstein investigation.  In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular 
confidence.  At this point, although Villafaña’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case, 
Villafaña did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office 
and her second-line supervisor, about the matter or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman. 
Villafaña met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July 14, 2006.  She told OPR that at 
the meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to 
Villafaña opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its 
“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafaña to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood 
coordinator.   
Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Attorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed 
by the Senate until August 3, 2006, and was not sworn in until October 2006.  In September 2006, Acosta announced 
the appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Matthew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they 
assumed their respective new offices in October 2006.   

Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure” 
to avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring attorneys who had personal connections to the 
State Attorney.  Villafaña said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset 
of the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely 
employ.  Villafaña explained, “When you have a case that you know people are going to be getting 
calls about . . . you just want to make sure that they know about it so they don’t get . . . a call from 
out of the blue.”  According to Villafaña, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to 
put the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t 
want to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had 
occurred with the state.  She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected 
the case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s 
resources if the Office would just back down to pressure at the end.”  According to Villafaña, 
Acosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.”  In a later 
email to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafaña recounted that she spoke with Acosta and 
Sloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal 
prosecution if the U.S. Attorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green 
light” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.   
Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2006 meeting with 
Villafaña.  Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not 
previously heard of Epstein.22   
Acosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man 
who was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable matter to pursue” 
federally.  Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told 
OPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.”  When asked by OPR to articulate the 
federal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the 
exploitation of girls or minor females.”  Regarding Villafaña’s view that she had been given a 
“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have 
explicitly told Villafaña to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been 
simply to acknowledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal 
investigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”   
Sloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein 
investigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Attorney’s Office had 
“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein.  In his OPR interview, 
Sloman did not recall with specificity Villafaña’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the 
State Attorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect 
the USAO, noting that as of July 2006, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically 
connected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.   
Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of 
Epstein.  On July 24, 2006, Villafaña emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as 
a “Manhattan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and 
Kevin Spacey.”  Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.       

4. 
Late July 2006:  The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves 
Forward with a Federal Investigation 
Several days after Villafaña spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July 19, 2006, Assistant 
State Attorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.23  Krischer told OPR that 
“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury.  According to a statement made at the time by the 
State Attorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest 
to lowest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of 
the room.24  The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony under state law because 
it alleged three or more instances of solicitation.25  The indictment did not identify the person or 
persons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.26  On July 23, 
2006, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the 
charges were made public.   
Villafaña told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that 
point because she believed the State Attorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a 
reduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy 
might preclude a federal prosecution.27  Villafaña told OPR that at the time, she “definitely 
believed that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that . . . we had 
sufficient evidence.” 
Villafaña and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed 
them.  Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance 
in this Report.   
Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2006, citing 
statement by State Attorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.   
Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2006CF9454AXX (July 19, 2006), attached as Exhibit 1 to this Report. 
In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the 1st day of August [2004] and October 31, 2005, 
[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three 
or more occasions.”  The 15-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made 
it impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the 
state indictment.  Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward 
at trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.   
The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal 
charges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses.  The Constitution does not prohibit the federal 
government from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquitted, or convicted on state charges based on 
the same criminal conduct.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition 
against double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns.  See, e.g., Gamble v. United 
States, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1960, 1966-67 (2019) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 
187, 195 (1959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 382 (1922).  Nonetheless, to 
better promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in 1959 and 1960 to 
guide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.  See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a 
more detailed discussion of the Petite policy. 

On July 24, 2006, Villafaña alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Attorney’s 
Office had charged and arrested Epstein.28  On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally 
opened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it.  Villafaña 
told Sloman that the FBI agents “are getting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to 
review everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal 
charges against Epstein was August 25, 2006.  Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was 
“appropriate to approach [State Attorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might 
go?”  Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.”29   
Although Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more 
active role in supervising the investigation, Villafaña continued to update Acosta and Sloman 
directly on the progress of the case.30  Villafaña’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had 
little involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafaña directed her 
emails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor.  In the 
immediate supervisor’s view, however, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the 
case, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”31   
By late August 2006, Villafaña and the FBI had identified several additional victims and 
obtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that show the 
communication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates.  Villafaña 
reported to her supervisors that the State Attorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the 
state grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to 
relinquish the evidence to the FBI.”  Villafaña also told her supervisors that she expected “a 
number of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply 
“after having contact with Epstein or his attorneys.”   
Villafaña’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask 
whether she was referring to the victims.  Villafaña responded that the problems did not involve 
victims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to 
document demands as overly burdensome.  Villafaña explained to Sloman and Lourie that some 
victims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but 
“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.”  Villafaña 
On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafaña had not yet briefed about the case, noting that 
Operation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”   
During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was 
likely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some 
type of relationship between somebody in the [State Attorney’s Office] and the defense team.”  
After Villafaña sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman, 
and Acosta on August 23, 2006, Lourie emailed Sloman:  “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the 
case?”  Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.  If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it 
through you guys.”      
OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office, 
that is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel.  Records show, and Villafaña told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s attorneys 
“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory 
chain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.   

also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped 
statements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies 
will be noted and considered.”  She conceded that “[g]etting them to tell their stories in front of a 
jury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the 
course.”  She acknowledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”   
The case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered 
up very well” with the USAO.  She recalled that there was little higher-level management oversight 
either from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were allowed to do what we needed to do to get our 
job done.”  This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein 
employees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial 
transactions.  The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”   
5. 
October 2006 – February 2007:  Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate 
Contact with Villafaña, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting 
Just as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became 
aware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and 
because the government was seeking records from his businesses.  One of Epstein’s New York 
attorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafaña in August 2006.  As the 
investigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal 
prosecution.32  As with the state investigation, Epstein employed attorneys who had experience 
with the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.33  One of Epstein’s 
Miami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2006.34  Lewis telephoned 
Villafaña, a call that Sloman joined at Villafaña’s request.  Lewis offered to provide Villafaña 
Villafaña told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.” 
Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the attorneys known to have represented 
Epstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the 
Department, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation.  At least one former AUSA also represented 
during civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein.  Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized 
Epstein was selecting attorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as 
“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”  Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”   
Lewis served in the USAO for over 10 years, and was U.S. Attorney from 2000 to 2002.  He then served for 
two years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the 
U.S. Attorneys.  
Early in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that 
Lourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA 
and also represented Epstein.  Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law 
partner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal.  The Professional 
Responsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under 
the conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.”  Thereafter, Sloman authorized 
Lourie to continue supervising the case.  During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to 
Lewis did not influence his handling of the case.   

“‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process.  Lewis asked to meet with Villafaña 
and Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafaña declined.   
Shortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him 
that she also represented Epstein.  Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2000 to September 
2005 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was 
the Chief.  According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when 
Sanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafaña led the defense team 
to believe that the matter had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of 
that notion.  Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible” 
in working with the USAO.  Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO 
on Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a letter to Villafaña on November 15, 2006, in which she asserted 
that she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact 
or communications about Epstein to them.  In response, Villafaña requested that the defense 
provide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents 
and information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Attorney’s Office, and 
“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media” 
removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2005.  In 
January 2007, Sanchez contacted Villafaña to schedule a meeting, but Villafaña responded that 
she wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.   
Immediately after receiving Villafaña’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafaña and phoned 
Lourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting.  Lourie agreed 
to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt.  Lourie explained to Villafaña that Sanchez was concerned 
that federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and 
promised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that 
would be a possibility.”  Villafaña told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents 
she had promised, and Villafaña wanted “the documents not the pitch.”  Lourie explained to OPR, 
however, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for 
us” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is power.”  Lourie further 
explained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO 
form its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged.  Lourie 
also believed that as a general matter, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a 
presentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.”  In addition to 
agreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narrowed document request, which responded to 
Sanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the 
demand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home.  The meeting was scheduled 
for February 1, 2007, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the 
USAO by January 25, 2007. 
Villafaña did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt.  Indeed, 
two days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafaña alerted him that she had spoken again with 
Sanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents.  As Villafaña 
told Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about how the girls are liars and drug users.”  
She told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what 
the defense would say, and she could not see how a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.  
She explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently” 

disagreed with her position.  Villafaña and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was 
consulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled 
meeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.  
They perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.35  According to Villafaña, Lourie believed 
that a meeting with the defense attorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal 
theories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO 
might learn information helpful to a prosecution.  Villafaña told OPR, however, that while this 
strategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or 
worthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to 
the conduct.  Villafaña also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information 
about the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended 
to charge, which Villafaña did not want to reveal.   
6. 
February 2007:  Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaña and 
Present the Defense Objections to a Federal Case 
At the February 1, 2007 meeting with Lourie and Villafaña, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out 
arguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal 
investigation.  In support of their arguments, the defense attorneys provided a 25-page letter, along 
with documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential 
impeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.    
In the letter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (1) the allegations did not 
provide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that 
Epstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving 
that any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the 
Petite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a matter that had already been addressed by the 
state; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.  
The letter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have 
affected” the USAO’s view of the case.  The letter also claimed that the State Attorney’s Office 
had taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s 
two principal victims (identified by name in the letter), and argued that “with witnesses of their 
ilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.”  Lourie told OPR 
that he did not recall the meeting, but Villafaña told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded 
by the defense presentation at this “listening session.” 
B. 
February – May 2007:  Villafaña and the FBI Continue to Investigate; 
Villafaña Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for 
USAO Managers to Review 
Correspondence between Villafaña and defense counsel show that Villafaña carefully 
considered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes 
Villafaña told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being 
“strategic thinkers.”  Her fellow AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as 
having occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.  Lourie did not recall making 
the statement but acknowledged that he could have.   

of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.36  Villafaña 
also pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert 
witness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims.  She also continued collecting records 
relating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s 
activity.  On several occasions, Villafaña sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable 
national expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as 
whether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.  
USAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a 
prosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case.  The prosecution memorandum was 
expected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant 
procedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues; 
expected defenses; and sentencing issues.  Routine prosecutions could be approved by lower-level 
supervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and 
approval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Attorney.  
Accordingly, Villafaña drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta, 
Sloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous 
October, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May 1, 
2007, supporting a proposed 60-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes 
relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors.  The prosecution memorandum set forth 
legal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other 
statutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and 
potential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who 
were expected to testify at trial.    
Villafaña’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum, 
had only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it.  The 
immediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the 
case was complex and that Villafaña would need co-counsel.   
In his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and 
proposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to 
employ a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that 
presented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already 
raised credibility issues to use in cross-examination.  Lourie told OPR that although he had some 
concerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues 
and the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as 
insurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution. 
Although indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require 
approval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office 
involvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go

February 20, 2007, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.   

forward with charges in this case.  Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to 
Menchel.  Lourie’s transmittal message read: 
Marie did a 50 [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case.  I am going 
to start reading it tonight. . . .  It’s a major case because the target is 
one of the richest men in the country and it has been big news.  He 
has a stable of attorneys, including Dershowitz, [Roy] Black, 
Lefcourt, Lewis, and Lily [sic] Sanchez.  Jeff Sloman is familiar 
with the investigation.  The state intentionally torpedoed it in the 
grand jury so it was brought to us.  I am going to forward the pros 
memo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do.  The 
FBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical, 
but we might as well get a jump on it.  I have some ideas about the 
indictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am 
not sending that yet. 
Lourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not 
have impeachment evidence to use against them.   
A few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution 
memorandum.  Lourie directed Menchel’s attention to particular pages of the prosecution 
memorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled 
for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they 
were 18.37  Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think 
the office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Attorney’s Office “went out of their 
way to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain 
away to nothing.”   
During his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmitting the prosecution 
memorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never 
heard of Epstein and had no information about his background.  He recalled that the USAO had 
been asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately.  Menchel told 
OPR, however, that he had little memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous 
opinions he formed about it.  
Acosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafaña’s prosecution 
memorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,” who had more 
prosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the 
case with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document.   Acosta 
In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that 
engaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was 
motivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes.  The defense also 
asserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under 18, but that 
Epstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least 18 years of age.”  In her prosecution 
memorandum, however, Villafaña set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual 
act was one of the motivating factors for the travel.  She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the 
defendant knew the victims were minors.          

recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he 
could not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the 
discussions.   
Sloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to 
Menchel, as a highly experienced trial attorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly 
with Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular 
review” of the charging package.  Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a 
team” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking 
the lead on the Epstein matter, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.   
C. 
May – June 2007:  Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum 
and Proposed Charges 
When she submitted the prosecution memorandum, Villafaña intended to file charges by 
May 15, 2007, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafaña, however, 
had not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule.  The managers in Miami wanted time to 
analyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging 
strategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that 
the FBI was planning a press conference for May 15, Sloman advised Villafaña that “[t]his Office 
has not approved the indictment.  Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”38    
On May 10, 2007, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafaña’s 
prosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterbaan, who in turn sent it to his deputy 
and another CEOS attorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and 
describing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”39  After 
CEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterbaan responded to Lourie with an email stating that the 
memorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafaña “has correctly focused 
on the issues as we see them.”  He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to 
the statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafaña’s assessments but noting that further 
research was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s 
knowledge of victims’ ages.  Oosterbaan offered to assign a CEOS attorney to work with Villafaña 
on the case.  Lourie forwarded Oosterbaan’s email to Menchel and Villafaña.    
Meanwhile, contemporaneous emails show that Lourie, at least, was already considering 
an early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.40  After Lourie spoke with 
Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a 
beauty pageant . . . where he is a judge.”  The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed 
with the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it.  After the federal 
investigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2006, Epstein largely stayed 
away from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.      
Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterbaan was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good 
friends with Lourie.   
In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may 
undermine our arguments for pretrial detention.”  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening 
a bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.   

the FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2007, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be 
quickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding, 
“I did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and 
offer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment.  That 
would have sent them thru the roof.”  Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing 
an indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea 
involving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.41   
Lourie told OPR that despite Oosterbaan’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was . . . a 
bit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterbaan had cited.  
Although Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably” 
did not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of 
walking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.”  But while Lourie “thought 
we could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were 
nearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a 
plea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a 
loss would be that the defendant did not go to jail.  Lourie told OPR that to the best of his 
recollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government 
might have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to 
require Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the 
victims.  Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should settle and we should set it up so we can 
settle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited 
charges in a criminal information.  Villafaña told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal 
complaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the 
case was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” toward a pre-indictment plea.   
Although Lourie and Villafaña believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired 
resolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to 
work together to shape an indictment.   On May 10, 2007, Lourie emailed Villafaña: 
[M]arie 
I believe that Epstein’s att[orneys] are scared of the victims they 
don’t know.  Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.  
Thus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims 
they have nothing on at all.  We can add in the other ones that have 
myspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding 
indictment].  I think for the first strike we should make all their 
nightmare[]s come true.  Thoughts?42 
Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s 
approval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as 
set forth in an extensive indictment, might not allow substantive counts to be dismissed.   
Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information 
brought forward by defense counsel.   

Lourie followed up his email to Villafaña with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated 
the potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafaña believed “the best 
thing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . . .  The 
[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 20 year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two 
conspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”43  
Menchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can 
discuss after that.”   
Later that afternoon, Villafaña sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel, 
explaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the 
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be 168 to 210 months, and that in her view, the facts warranted 
an upward departure from that range.  Villafaña told OPR that although Lourie proposed some 
changes to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient 
to support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case. 
In an email to Acosta and Menchel on May 11, 2007, Lourie recommended charging 
Epstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea: 
My current thoughts are that we should charge him.  Not sure that I 
agree with the charging strategy as it is now, but at this point I think 
we only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover 
the conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.  
I think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some 
of the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree.  We can 
decide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely 
and which victims should be charged. 
I also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a 
complaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants 
a pre-indictment resolution.  That would give us more control [over] 
a plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss 
counts.  We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a 
plea attractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we 
try to dismiss indicted counts. 
Although her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafaña 
was unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.  
She continued preparing to charge Epstein.  Two weeks after submitting the prosecution 
memorandum, on May 14, 2007, Villafaña informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein 
was flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges 
the next day.  Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrow,” 
and explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-town conference, 
adding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure 
Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, the general 
“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.   

he is comfortable before proceeding.”  Menchel told Villafaña he had “trouble understanding” why 
she was in a “rush” “given how long this case has been pending.”44    
OPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing 
the prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges.  Acosta and Menchel believed Villafaña’s 
timeline was unrealistic from the start.  Acosta told OPR that Villafaña was “very hard charging,” 
but her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.”  Menchel described Villafaña 
as “out over her skis a little bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.45  
Menchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about 
whether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision.  Menchel 
told OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision 
on.”  Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed 
charges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the 
facts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.”  Lourie told 
OPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”   
Villafaña continued to seek direction from her managers.  On May 15, 2007, she emailed 
Sloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will 
not do any good.  Am I right about that?”  Sloman responded, “Yes.”  On May 21, 2007, three 
weeks after submitting the prosecution memorandum, Villafaña emailed Sloman and Menchel 
asking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed–i.e., approval of an indictment something 
like the current draft, a complaint to allow for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment 
drastically different from the current draft?”  Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”46  
D. 
Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which 
Villafaña Opposes 
Meanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the 
federal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta.  In a May 10, 
2007 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s attorneys “want me to tell them the statutes 
Villafaña explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:  
“In terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars.  That was our 
time concern.”  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not recall Villafaña offering this explanation to him.  OPR 
notes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafaña 
expressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events.  When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those 
conflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the 
testimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.   
Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafaña was “ahead of where the office was internally” and 
that caused “discontent” between Villafaña and Menchel.  Villafaña was not the only one, however, who was surprised 
that the indictment was not approved immediately.  The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed” 
after Villafaña submitted the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum towards an indictment abated.  Villafaña’s 
immediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”  
However, Menchel rebuked Villafaña in his July 5, 2007 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing 
charges in] this matter was a foregone conclusion.”    
Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he 
had spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.   

we are contemplating so Dershowitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”47  Lourie told Menchel, “I 
don’t see the downside,” but added, “Marie is against it.”  Menchel responded that it was 
“premature” to provide the information.  During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically 
recall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information, 
but speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for 
Acosta to have made a decision about how he wanted to proceed.  This recollection is consistent 
with the May 2007 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.   
On May 22, 2007, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a letter to “confirm” that 
Epstein’s attorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached 
a final decision on charging Epstein.  Lourie forwarded the letter to Menchel and Sloman, but 
noted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting 
with him.  Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex 
would be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.”  Lourie also emailed 
Lefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges, 
and suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.   
Although Lourie’s emails show that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers 
meeting with defense counsel, Villafaña opposed such a meeting.  Several emails indicate that 
Menchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafaña on the afternoon of 
May 23, 2007.48  On that same date, Villafaña drafted an email, which she planned to send to 
Sloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel.  Although 
the email was written for Sloman and Menchel, Villafaña sent it as a draft only to her immediate 
supervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to how to proceed.   
Hi Jeff and Matt – I just want to again voice my disagreement with 
promising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or 
any other of Epstein’s attorneys.  As I mentioned, this is not a case 
where we will be sitting down to negotiate whether a defendant will 
serve one year versus two years of probation.  This is a case where 
the defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison 
time.  Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than 
they would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case 
differently.  Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed 
at the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed 
at a future meeting.  
My co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the 
rest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of 
some of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting.  We 
have been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our 
Dershowitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.   
During her OPR interview, Villafaña could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose 
was to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel.  Menchel, similarly, 
told OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.   

opposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case 
as a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as 
a white collar or public corruption case where the parties can 
amicably work out a light sentence.49 
With respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss, 
those were already raised in his letter (which is part of the indictment 
package) and during his meeting with Andy and myself.  Those 
reasons are:  (1) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability 
to prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and 
(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be 
prosecuted at all.  Unless the Office thinks that any of those 
arguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the 
prosecution, it will only benefit the defense.  With respect to 
Lefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been 
provided.  The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the 
defense the other charges that we are considering.  In my opinion 
this would seriously undermine the prosecution. 
The defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the 
investigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation, 
and to use political pressure to stop the investigation. 
I have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to 
meet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case 
will be disclosed.  However, if you all do decide to go forward with 
these meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then 
I will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in 
agreement with the handling of the case. 
After receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafaña, “Let’s talk before 
this is sent, please.”50  Villafaña told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafaña not to send the 
email to Sloman or Menchel because Villafaña could be viewed as insubordinate.  She also told 
Villafaña that if Villafaña did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would 
never serve a day in jail.”     
Villafaña told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file 
charges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.  She 
also told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going down the same path that 
the State Attorney’s Office had gone down.”  Villafaña believed the purpose of the defense request 
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a 
defendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel 
to discuss the merits of a case.   
The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafaña that she and Villafaña were “not driving the ship,” and 
once “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”   

for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t 
want to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a 
misguided belief “that [Epstein’s] attorneys would not engage in this behavior.”  Villafaña told 
OPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s 
behavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was 
a need to move with necessary speed.”  Nonetheless, Villafaña followed the guidance of her 
immediate supervisor and did not send the email.    
Like Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good 
practice.  Menchel told OPR that he saw “no downside” to hearing the defense point of view.  
Defense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or 
alternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and 
Menchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.  
Menchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafaña ever articulating a concern that Epstein was 
continuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in 
Florida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those 
circumstances. 
E. 
June 2007:  Villafaña Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum  
While Villafaña’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed 
charges, Villafaña took additional steps to support them.  On June 14, 2007, she supplemented the 
prosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of 
the victims.  In the email transmitting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her 
immediate supervisor, Villafaña reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,” 
and the “different strategies” about how to structure the charges left Villafaña unsure whether “to 
make . . . changes now or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”  
The addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most 
frequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein 
assistant.  In the addendum, Villafaña identified documents she had found corroborating four 
separate statements made by this victim.   
Villafaña told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated 
specific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum.  Lourie told OPR that he had 
no specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum 
addressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any 
other victim.  Villafaña’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the 
discussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.   
F. 
The June 26, 2007 Meeting with Defense Counsel  
Menchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2007, communicating directly 
with Sanchez about the arrangements.  At Menchel’s instruction, on June 18, 2007, Villafaña sent 
a letter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”51  
Villafaña sent copies of this letter to both Menchel and Sanchez.  Villafaña told OPR that she objected to 
sending this information to the defense.  Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafaña to send the letter to 

On that same day, Villafaña emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor 
complaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed 
indictment and asking again for feedback.  During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that 
Villafaña’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody 
else,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue.  Sloman told OPR that he did not 
know whether Villafaña received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in 
time, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about how to proceed. 
The day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmitted to the USAO a 
19-page letter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present 
in order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the 
conduct at issue here.”  Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly 
contested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the matter.  Among other issues, Lefcourt’s 
letter argued: 
x Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults–16 or 17 years of age”–was 
“strictly a state concern.” 
x Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant 
reasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was 
years of age. 
x One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was 
intended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet 
trolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims. 
x The “travel” statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of” 
engaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family, 
oversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of 
daily living.” 
Lefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a 
significant impact on any federal prosecution.”52 
Lourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafaña, an email dividing the defense arguments 
into “weaker” and “stronger” points.  Lourie disagreed with the argument that 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) 
was limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible 
for federal interest.”  On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not 
travel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.  
Lefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafaña’s claim that he had done so.   Menchel also told 
OPR that he did not recall Villafaña objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.      
Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and 
omissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit.  As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable 
cause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied 
knowledge of any videotaping.”  (Emphasis in original).  

Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal 
high school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported 
the conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole 
purpose.  However, Lourie expressed concern about “getting to the jury” on this issue and noted 
that he had not found a legal case factually on point.  Villafaña told OPR that she disagreed with 
Lourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the matter with him.53  Villafaña 
also recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered 
“particularly weak.”    
On June 26, 2007, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafaña, the case agent, and the West Palm 
Beach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein attorneys Dershowitz, Black, 
Lefcourt, and Sanchez.  Dershowitz led the defense team’s presentation.  From the USAO 
perspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”54  Echoing the arguments made in 
Lefcourt’s letter, Dershowitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case 
because these were “traditionally state offenses.”  The case agent recalled being uncomfortable 
that the defense was asking questions in an attempt to gain information about the federal 
investigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been 
involved.   
Villafaña told OPR that when Epstein’s attorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be 
“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.”  But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey 
obviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.”  According 
to Villafaña, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie 
expressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general 
credibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense 
presentation had not been persuasive.  Villafaña told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the 
impression that we were continuing towards” filing charges. 
IV. 
ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO 
RESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
USAO internal communications show that in July 2007, Acosta developed, or adopted, the 
broad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation.  The agreement would 
leave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would 
accomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors:  Epstein’s incarceration; his 
registration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary 
Villafaña also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove 
Epstein’s knowledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were 16 or 17 at the time they provided 
massages.     
In his written response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26, 
2007 meeting.  In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had little memory of the meeting, to the best of 
his recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel 
opined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their 
position.”   

damages.55  During a two-month period, the subject attorneys were involved to varying degrees in 
converting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on 
September 24, 2007.  The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both 
the larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of 
conceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution.  However, the contemporaneous emails 
and other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their 
deliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear.  In particular, Menchel 
and Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but 
neither had a clear memory of their conversations.  Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the 
facts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.      
In the following account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal 
investigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous 
communications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA.  OPR 
questioned each of the subjects about how the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution, 
and OPR includes below the subjects’ explanations.  The subjects’ memories of particular 
conversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus 
emerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the 
willingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the 
case that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail 
at trial and through appeal.  In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority 
to prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors.  Based 
on this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve 
the matter through a state plea.  In any event, Acosta acknowledged to OPR that, at a minimum, 
he approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations 
and the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum.  
Furthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.  
A. 
June – July 2007:  The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the 
Defense Rejects 
A few days after the June 26, 2007 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafaña, advising her that 
Epstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July 11, 2007, and hoped 
“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”56  In a July 3, 2007 email, Villafaña 
told Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea 
discussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could 
State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allow 
law enforcement and the public to know the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and, 
in some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.  The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry 
is administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act 
of 2006 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration 
and Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen 
the nationwide network of sex offender registrations. 
In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands 
for records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before 
the October 2005 state search warrant and that Villafaña had been requesting from the defense since late 2006.    

include concurrent time.”  The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafaña did not 
explain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.57  Villafaña requested to be advised, 
“[i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s attorneys that is contrary to this.”  Villafaña, 
who was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the 
case, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the 
defense attorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions 
about a possible plea.   
In response to Villafaña’s email, Menchel notified Villafaña that he had told Sanchez “a 
state plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Attorney],” but Sanchez 
had responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”58  During his OPR interview, Menchel had no 
independent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense 
deemed the proposal a “non-starter.”  However, Menchel explained that he would not have made 
the proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knowledge.  He also pointed out that in numerous emails 
before the June 26, 2007 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he 
wanted to do with the Epstein case.  Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember 
a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have 
discussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”   
1. 
Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based 
Resolution 
Subsequent events showed that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was 
pivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning.  In his OPR interview, Acosta 
explained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution.  Acosta 
said that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did 
what he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in 
terms of testimony.”59  Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about how the 
victims would “do on the stand.” 
Acosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether, 
because the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.  
Villafaña explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a 
substantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a 
recommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein] 
would receive credit for time in state custody towards his federal release date.”  See n.65 for an explanation of the 
Ashcroft Memo.  
Villafaña was then in trial and on July 4, 2007, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafaña responded 
to defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a 
federal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”       
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or 
deciding how to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in 
reaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA.  However, Sloman also told OPR that he had little 
recollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and 
Menchel.   

[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so 
here is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign . . . 
state, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind . . . the 
whole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state . . . 
is an independent entity, and that we should presume that what 
they’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except 
in the most unusual of circumstances.   
Acosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have 
become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis.  As Acosta 
explained in a public statement he issued in 2011, “the federal responsibility” in this unique 
situation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no 
miscarriage of justice.”60  Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as 
a federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the 
federal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate.  In the latter 
circumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”61  Acosta 
explained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice.  But it was his understanding 
that if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable 
offense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be 
viewed as a manifest injustice. 
Acosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result 
in unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or 
“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was 
an emerging matter of federal interest.  Acosta contended that in 2006, “it would have been 
extremely unusual for any United States Attorney’s Office to become involved in a state 
solicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of 
state prosecutors.”  Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least 
some individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking 
case.”  Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal 
might result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.   
Acosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s 
victims.  In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2007 might have permitted “victim shaming,” 
which would have been traumatic for them.  In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned 
a one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the 
state grand jury found little merit to the case.62  Acosta told OPR: 
Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at 1 (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The 
Daily Beast.  
Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allowing the presumption that a prior state prosecution 
has vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate 
in light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated 
federal prosecution.”  USAM § 9-2.031.D.   
Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Attorney’s Office had 
deliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.  Menchel told OPR that he understood that the State 

I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the 
shoes of the thought process in 2006 and ’07 when trafficking 
prosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some 
jurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s 
tolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation 
on the part of victims . . . .63 
Finally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning 
a sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district 
court in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence 
that differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.64  
In summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR, 
The way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing 
enough.  It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for 
registration, and then you had the restitution issue.  There were legal 
issues . . . . There were witness issues.  And . . . we could go to trial 
. . . and we may or may not prevail.  Alternatively, we could look at 
a pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went 
back and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a 
state pre-indictment resolution.  
Acosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in 
part, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution 
rather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.”  Acosta explained 
that he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the 
Epstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because 
the defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.   
Attorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand 
jury because the State Attorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or 
proceeding on a lesser charge.   
Menchel told OPR, however, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were 
generally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”     
Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule 11 is not something that [South 
Florida federal district] judges tend to do.”  Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District 
of Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule 
11(c) pleas.”  
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of 
a plea agreement.  The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court 
does not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void.  Villafaña told OPR that Rule 11(c) pleas 
were “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to 
impose.”  Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as 
averse to Rule 11(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.  Villafaña told OPR that she had never offered 
a Rule 11(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.   

Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his 
own “emails . . . make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.”  He 
referenced, among others, his May 14, 2007 email to Villafaña informing her that Acosta was 
deciding how he wanted to handle the case.  Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished 
two things that Acosta viewed as important:  first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and 
second, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have allowed.  Menchel 
told OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and 
that any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration.  He 
told OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you know, it’s not that big a deal.  That was 
not the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.”  Rather, Menchel said, 
“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.” 
2. 
July 2007:  Villafaña and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State 
Resolution  
Villafaña told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining 
that he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea.  In 
Villafaña’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond” 
to Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable 
offense.”65  In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy.  Villafaña 
also told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative 
agency about plea negotiations, and Villafaña did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state 
plea.  Villafaña also believed the CVRA required attorneys for the government to confer with 
victims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.  
Villafaña told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation 
who had negative impressions of the State Attorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them 
back to the State Attorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.   
This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2003 memorandum from then Attorney General John Ashcroft 
regarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing” 
(known as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:  
[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the 
most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts 
of the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, United States 
Attorney, or designated supervisory attorney in the limited circumstances 
described below.  The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the 
most substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory 
minimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a 
longer sentence.  A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good 
faith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily 
to prove a charge at trial.  Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert 
leverage to induce a plea.  Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges 
may not be dismissed except to the extent permitted [elsewhere in this 
Memorandum].  
See also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.1.   

In light of these concerns, Villafaña emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement 
with the process: 
[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without 
consulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more 
inappropriate to make a plea offer that you know is completely 
unacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement], the victims, and me.  These plea negotiations violate 
the Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Attorney[s’] Manual, and all of the 
various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.  Strategically, 
you have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position 
of weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the 
defense that we will demand no federal conviction.  We left the 
meeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered, 
and your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes 
away that advantage.  If you make it seem like the U.S. Attorney 
doesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to 
make a deal.   
Second, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for 
“show” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with 
Epstein’s attorneys directly. . . . 
. . . . 
I would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Attorney, Jeff 
[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation 
and a revised indictment.  The presentation will address the points 
raised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength 
of the case. 
In the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s 
counsel to me. 
Menchel told OPR he realized Villafaña was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.  
Villafaña had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not 
unsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case.  However, as Menchel told OPR, 
Villafaña’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a little bit more dispassionate,” and 
her urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position.  Menchel viewed the tone of Villafaña’s 
email as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect.  In 
particular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge 
the “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S. 
Attorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive 
the policy.   

Menchel’s reply email began with a rebuke: 
Both the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate 
and, in combination with other matters in the past, it seriously calls 
your judgment into question. 
As you well know, the US Attorney has not even decided whether 
to go forward with a prosecution in this matter, thus you should have 
respected his position before engaging in plea negotiations. 
Along that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you 
made to the agents in this matter, it was made clear to you by the US 
Attorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first 
authorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns 
about taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of 
legal issues.  Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros 
memo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.  
It has come to my attention that you led the agents to believe that 
the indictment of this matter was a foregone conclusion and that our 
decision to put off that date and listen to the defense attorneys’ 
concerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about 
indicting.  As you well knew, you were never given authorization 
by anyone to seek an indictment in this case.66   
In the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with 
Sanchez and respond to Villafaña’s complaints:   
Lilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting.  It 
was an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea 
offer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take 
to resolve the matter.  As you are also well aware, the only reason 
why this office even agreed to look into the Epstein matter in the 
first instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an 
adequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights.  As you and the 
agents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that 
resulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI 
nor our office ever would have interceded.  You should also know 
that my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US 
Attorney’s full knowledge.  Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in 
pursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all 
the interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.  
In any event, I fail to see how a discussion that went nowhere has 
hurt our bargaining position.  I am also quite confident that no one 
Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie. 

on the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this 
matter has been for show. 
Nor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the 
USAM or any other policy well taken.  As Chief of the Criminal 
Division, I am the person designated by the US Attorney to exercise 
appropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are 
appropriate and consistent with the Ashcroft memo and the USAM 
– not you. 
As for your statement that my concerns about this case hurting 
Project Safe Childhood are unfounded, I made it clear to you that 
those concerns were voiced by the US Attorney.67  Whether or not 
you are correct, matters of policy are always within his purview and 
any decisions in that area ultimately rest with him. 
Finally, you may not dictate the dates and people you will meet with 
about this or any other case.  If the U.S. Attorney or the First 
Assistant desire to meet with you, they will let you know.  Nor will 
I direct Epstein’s lawyers to communicate only with you.  If you 
want to work major cases in the district you must understand and 
accept the fact that there is a chain of command – something you 
disregard with great regularity. 
Villafaña acknowledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to 
deviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable 
offense.  She disagreed, however, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta 
and Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that 
meeting.68  Villafaña told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel 
mentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.69     
A week later, Villafaña replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the 
process and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward: 
Hi Matt -- My trial is over, so I now have [ ] time to focus back on 
this case and our e-mail exchange.  There are several points in your 
Neither Menchel nor Villafaña could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring.  In commenting 
on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with 
serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of 
trafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”  
Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.   
Villafaña characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her] 
place” by him.  She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”  
Menchel, however, asserted to OPR that Villafaña had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted 
his strong response.   

e-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address 
where we are in the case. 
First, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of 
command.  After that concern was brought to my attention several 
months ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of 
command. . . .  If there is a particular instance of violating the chain 
of command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to 
discuss it with you. 
. . . . 
The statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding 
the prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the 
frustration in the tone of my e-mail.  For two and a half months I 
have been asking about what that position is.  I have asked for 
direction on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are 
other issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether 
there is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc.  None of 
that direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims, 
and agents all demanding to know why we aren’t presenting an 
indictment.  Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of 
yours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not know to 
whom I should address my frustration.  My recollection of the 
original meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your 
summary.  In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State 
Attorney’s Office’s handling of it.  I acknowledged that we needed 
to do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and 
I noted the time and money that would be required for an 
investigation.  I said that I was willing to invest that time and the 
FBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the 
end and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-powered 
lawyers.  I was assured that that would not happen.  Now I feel like 
there is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while 
evidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this 
criminal behavior.  Additionally, the FBI has identified two more 
victims.  If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to 
give hope to more girls. 
As far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone 
conclusion, I don’t know of any case in the Office where an 
investigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict.  And I 
have never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a 
declination.  I didn’t treat this case any differently.  I worked with 
the agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment 
package that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of 
crimes have been committed.  More importantly, I believe there is 

proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.  
Lastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Attorney 
or anyone else.  I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting, 
asking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense 
attorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office.  With 
respect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say 
that disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the 
forgotten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified 
as a lapse in judgment.  This Office should seek to foster spirited 
debate about the law and the use of prosecutorial discretion . . . . 
[M]y first and only concern in this case (and my other child 
exploitation cases) is the victims.  If our personality differences 
threaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case 
whom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights. 
In the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to 
begin preparing a revised indictment package containing your 
suggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by 
Epstein’s attorneys. . . .  If there are any specific issues that you or 
the U.S. Attorney would like to see addressed, please let me know.70 
Villafaña did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested.  She viewed Menchel’s 
message as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even 
though she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise 
her concerns.71  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafaña to refrain from 
raising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafaña 
foreclosed her from meeting with Acosta.  Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running 
roughshod over the U.S. Attorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process.  You’re not 
in charge of it.  I’m not in charge of it.  [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”  Acosta, who was apparently 
not aware of Villafaña’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective, 
Villafaña was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him 
directly for a meeting.   
B. 
Villafaña Attempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from 
Epstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts 
As the USAO managers considered in July 2007 how to resolve the federal investigation, 
one item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer 
equipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant.  Although 
Villafaña took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.   
Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.   
Villafaña told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafaña, but that 
Menchel responded it was not Villafaña’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.  

Early in the federal investigation, Villafaña recognized the potential significance of 
obtaining the missing computer equipment.  Villafaña told OPR that she and the FBI agents went 
through every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as 
child pornography.  Nevertheless, Villafaña told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein 
used hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed 
he could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home.  In addition, the computer 
equipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements 
about visiting Epstein’s home.  More generally, in Villafaña’s experience, individuals involved in 
child exploitation often possessed child pornography.72  Villafaña’s co-counsel, who had 
substantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a 
billionaire.  We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his 
capabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.   
As the investigation continued, Villafaña took various steps to acquire the computer 
equipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.  As noted previously in this Report, in 
her initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he 
computers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs, 
floppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence.  Although Lourie subsequently 
narrowed the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.  
The defense, however, failed to comply with the request.   
Villafaña learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular 
individual.  After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section 
and Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer 
equipment, Villafaña described her plan in an email to Menchel.  She asked Menchel for any 
comments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR 
that he did not recall Villafaña’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.  
In May 2007, following the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafaña initiated action 
requiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.  In her email to Villafaña on 
June 29, 2007, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based 
resolution” to the case would soon be reached.73  Villafaña advised her supervisors of the request, 
and responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”  
Nonetheless, Villafaña eventually agreed to an extension. 
Meanwhile, Epstein attorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafaña, demanding to know 
whether Villafaña had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer 
In addition, Villafaña became aware that in August 2007, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated 
that she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of 
the girls.   
This email led Villafaña to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible 
resolution of the case, which resulted in Villafaña’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of 
the case.   See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.  

equipment.74  After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafaña, and 
Lourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the 
USAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained below, never happened 
because the parties entered into the NPA. 
C. 
July 2007:  The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation 
In addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment, 
defense counsel also sent letters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2007, and July 25, 2007, reiterating 
their objections to a federal investigation of Epstein.  The July 25, 2007 letter included a lengthy 
“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had committed no 
federal offense.  The July 25 letter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former 
Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that 
this is not a matter upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”75   
While the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS 
expressed its endorsement of Villafaña’s legal analysis and proposed charges.  On July 18, 2007, 
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read 
Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job.  As we 
opined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis.  Her charging 
decisions are legally sound.”  Oosterbaan observed: 
I have also reviewed the arguments contained in the letters from 
defense counsel.  Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive, 
but I find none of their arguments persuasive.  That is not to say that 
all the arguments are completely devoid of merit.  I expect the judge 
to consider some of the arguments closely.  Nevertheless, while the 
law applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of 
available precedent favors us.  From the prosecution memorandum 
it is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments, 
scrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.  
And, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a 
strong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth 
facing.  I also happen to know that there is absolutely no concern . . . 
about facing the challenges this case presents. 
In closing, Oosterbaan renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to 
send “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.   
Villafaña forwarded Black’s letter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the 
computer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the 
Department, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.   
The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email 
exchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterbaan, who commented, “By the way, let me know if you want me 
to put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised 
with similar facts.”   

D. 
Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of 
Incarceration 
The next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-
year term of imprisonment.  Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would 
accept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with 
the result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued.  The 
contemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years 
as the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able 
to recall how the decision was made.  As discussed below, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation, 
but OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.76      
While the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to 
Villafaña, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafaña continued moving toward filing charges.  On 
July 19, 2007, the day after receiving Oosterbaan’s email supporting a potential prosecution, 
Villafaña emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps 
regarding three of Epstein’s assistants.  However, Menchel directed Villafaña to “hold off . . . until 
we decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next 
week.”  Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafaña to wait, but 
he assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.   
On Monday, July 23, 2007, Menchel submitted a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that 
he would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2007.77   
1. 
The July 26, 2007 Meeting in Miami 
Early on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2007, Villafaña informed Menchel that she was 
preparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all 
but three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt 
acts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, however, have the revised 
indictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:00 p.m. meeting.  Menchel told OPR 
that the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafaña to 
delay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something” 
with the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed 
with federal charges.  
Acosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2007.  On that afternoon, Villafaña met in 
Miami with Menchel.  She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their 
supervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone.  Villafaña told OPR that 
she expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the 
investigation.  However, Villafaña told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered 
the room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.”  According to 
See Section IV.D.2 in this Part. 
As early as May 4, 2007, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter 
private practice.   

Villafaña, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafaña “shocked and 
stunned.”   
Menchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2007 meeting.  Nonetheless, he 
strongly disputed Villafaña’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at 
odds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and 
leave without discussion.  Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at 
some point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision 
at the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s 
relaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to 
do so.  Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting.  The FBI case agent recalled attending a 
meeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafaña, 
Lourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed how to proceed with the 
Epstein case.  According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be 
registered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court 
had ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.   
Regardless of exactly how Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was 
communicated to Villafaña and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the 
specific term, the record shows that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a 
resolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknowledged.78   
2. 
The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence 
with a Two-Year Term of Incarceration 
Villafaña asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the 
decision was made.79  Villafaña told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and 
none of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view, 
explained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence.  Villafaña also told OPR that 
Menchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2007 meeting, and Villafaña 
did not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.  
Villafaña described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines 
people, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines.  There’s no way to get 
to 24 months with this set of offenses.”80   
OPR notes that Villafaña did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors setting forth her views and 
objections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made 
to offer a two-year term of incarceration.  Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and 
Villafaña, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a 
decision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting. 
OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafaña had knowledge of Acosta’s 
decision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2007 meeting at which she said she learned of it.       
From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in 1987, they have been the mechanism for 
calculating federal criminal sentences.  Since 2005, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are 
required to consider them.  As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.710, 

Sloman also told OPR that he did not know how the decision to offer a two-year plea offer 
was reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from 
Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña.  He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an 
assessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.81  Sloman added 
that he did not know how a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either 
state or federal sentencing guidelines.  Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall how the two-year 
term was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the 
defense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by 
Acosta following “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman, 
Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña.82 
Menchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or 
who reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence.  Menchel also told OPR, 
however, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges, 
Epstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take 
the case to trial.  Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial, 
and in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to 
testify.  Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as 
a fair result in terms of the conduct.  I think that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not 
if we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have 
gotten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.” 
Acosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some 
point,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a 
week or two.”  As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely 
as a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[, 
‘]encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[’]”83  Acosta said that he understood two years’ 
imprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the 
PBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.84  Acosta also told OPR that he 
the attorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in 
its determination of the sentence to be imposed.  The prosecutor must be familiar 
with the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable 
to his or her case.  In discharging these duties, the attorney for the government 
should . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information 
upon which the sentencing decisions will be based. 
In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.   
Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front 
office who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”    
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a little 
bit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case.  Acosta’s attorney 
also asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially 
more onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the 
State to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”      
OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment 
corresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in 

understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had 
pursued the appropriate charges.  In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly, 
an analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what 
is the appropriate federal outcome to that.”  Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his 
concerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific 
conversation with them. 
E. 
Villafaña Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential 
Agreement with the Defense 
A meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 31, 2007.  Villafaña told 
OPR that between July 26 and July 30, 2007, she had “some sort of discussion” with her 
supervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for 
resolving the federal investigation through state charges.  Sometime during that period, Villafaña 
left a voicemail message for Menchel.  During their OPR interviews, neither Villafaña nor 
Menchel could recall what Villafaña said in that message.  On July 30, 2007, Menchel emailed 
Villafaña: 
I received your voicemail this morning.  I don’t see any reason to 
change our approach.  I think telling them that unless the state 
resolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and 
the interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys 
that we are serious.  While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the 
past that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite 
these terms before.  In any event, this is the course of action that the 
US Attorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.   
The following day, July 31, 2007, Villafaña emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein 
Non-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie.  Villafaña told OPR she had never 
before seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign” 
to her.85  Villafaña told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein 
the state indictment.  OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found 
no obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.   
Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for 
resolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities.  A 2008 Departmental memorandum explained:  
The terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement” 
have often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and 
commentators.   As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution 
of Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically 
predicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and 
the agreement is filed with the appropriate court.  In the non-prosecution 
agreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained 
by the parties rather than being filed with a court.  Clear and consistent use of 
these terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best 
practices and to track the use of such agreements.  These Principles do not apply 

as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated 
that terminology to her.  According to Villafaña, she asked that it include a mechanism for the 
victims to be provided monetary compensation through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution 
that would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.86  Acosta told 
OPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”   
Before the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from 
Villafaña’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified 
victims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the 
month.  The final term sheet was as follows: 
to plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a 
court proceeding.   
Memorandum from Acting Deputy Attorney General Craig S. Morford to Heads of Departmental Components and 
United States Attorneys at n.2 (Mar. 7, 2008), available at https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-
manual-163-selection-and-use-monitors.  Villafaña did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.  
A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal 
criminal code at 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2006, to  
March 6, 2013, provided as follows:  
Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section 
2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of 
this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless 
of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any 
appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such 
person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.  Any 
person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained 
damages of no less than $150,000 in value.   
Villafaña also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that 
required him to register as a sexual offender; however, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3, 
2007 email to Villafaña recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.   

V.
THE USAO PRESENTS EPSTEIN WITH KEY TERMS OF A DEAL:
PLEAD 
GUILTY TO STATE CHARGES REQUIRING A TWO-YEAR TERM OF 
INCARCERATION AND SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION, AND AGREE 
TO A MEANS FOR THE VICTIMS TO OBTAIN MONETARY DAMAGES
Although the USAO term sheet was presented to Epstein’s defense team on July 31, 2007, 
it took almost another two months to reach a final agreement in the form of the NPA.  The 
contemporaneous emails show that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered 
multiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the 
state plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement.  The emails make clear 
that as the negotiations intensified in September 2007, the prosecutors became increasingly 
frustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and 
provisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.  
It is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning

the period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two 
years in prison.”  The USAO did, however, consistently reject defense proposals to change other 
terms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.     
A. 
July 31, 2007:  The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which 
Makes a Counteroffer 
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafaña, and the case agents met with Epstein attorneys 
Lefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 31, 2007, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the 
USAO.87   The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafaña distributed a federal sentencing 
guidelines calculation showing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of 
188 to 235 months’ incarceration.    
Villafaña recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s attorneys opposed the requirement of 
sexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein 
serve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”88 in lieu of incarceration, and 
emphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.89  Villafaña told OPR 
that when Epstein’s attorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a 
state prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a 
federal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility.  A few days after the meeting, 
Villafaña emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-1/2 
year cap.”   
Although Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence 
show that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal 
Villafaña was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting. 
According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control, 
The Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to 
incarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program 
where you are confined to your home unless you are working, attending school, 
performing public service hours, participating in treatment or another special 
activity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was 
designed to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a 
punishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control 
supervision (also known as “house arrest”) you will not be allowed to leave your 
home to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation, 
or many of the other activities you are used to being able to do . . . , but it does 
allow you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or attend school 
in lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.

Villafaña told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of 
experience with the state system.  We did not.”  Villafaña anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state 
sentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with 
Lourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.   

charges in addition to state charges.  On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez followed up on the 
July 31, 2007 meeting with an August 2, 2007 letter to Menchel:  
We welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither 
appropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the 
state prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable.  We 
acknowledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal 
misdemeanors was an attempt to resolve this dilemma.  Our 
proposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we 
believe, leave little doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably 
vindicated.90 
Sanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never 
been arrested before.  He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”   
The “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense letter involved no period of 
mandatory incarceration.  Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular 
reporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court 
and probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service; 
psychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims.  The letter 
specifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed 
under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified 
group of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] – that is, the 12 individuals noted at the 
meeting on July 31, 2007.”  Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only 
if he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.  Sanchez also advised that the defense 
team was seeking a meeting with Acosta. 
B. 
In an August 3, 2007 Letter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of 
Imprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest 
Villafaña told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable, 
and she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response.  Villafaña drafted for 
Menchel’s signature a letter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment 
to be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.  
Villafaña’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not 
appropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allow Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation 
for a two-year term of incarceration.  Villafaña specified that Epstein would also be required to 
concede liability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal 
investigation, “not just the 12 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”   
The USAO countered, however, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that 
“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.”  Records show that throughout the 
Epstein matter, the USAO attorneys identified instances when defense attorneys misstated or otherwise did not 
accurately describe events or statements.  Accordingly, in evaluating the subject attorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely 
on uncorroborated defense assertions. 

Menchel made several substantive changes to Villafaña’s draft letter.  He specified that “a 
two-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal 
interest in the case.  (Emphasis added.)  With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote 
that the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the reference to a 
Rule 11(c) plea.  Menchel also removed the reference to the specific state offenses to which Epstein 
would be required to plead guilty.  Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they 
speak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña. 
The final letter, as shown on the following pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except 
that it omitted all reference to a federal plea under Rule 11(c).91 
Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule 11(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges 
were generally averse to them.  He did not recall why the provision was dropped from the letter, but “assumed” it was 
a decision by Acosta.  In a September 6, 2007 email, Villafaña told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a 
Rule 11(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.”  Villafaña told OPR 
that Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule 11(c) plea.

Than.le you for your letter of August 2'' regarding your proposal on how to resolve the 
Epstein matter. 
As we explained at our meeting on July 31, 2007, the Office believes thatthe federal 
interest will not be vindicated in the absence of a two-year term of state imprisonment for 
Mr. Epstein. That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is th.e minimum 
term of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has 
never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we 
simply stated that if Mr. Epstein preferred to serve his sentence in a federal pcnctcntiary, we 
would be w:illing to explore a federal conviction that may allow that in lieu of any state 
resolution. Further, as I made clear in our follow up telephone conversation after the 
meeting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer. 
We also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of 
the minor girls identified during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis 
of an initial p lanned charging instrument 
As you know, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is drnmatically 
changed upon the return of an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does 
ttot intend to file a Superseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case 
in favor of state prosecution. 

Menchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for 
negotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more 
jail time rather than less.  Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by 
retaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him 
into a federal penitentiary.”  The letter’s deadline of August 17, 2007, for acceptance of the 
government’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafaña’s request that the deadline provide 
her with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s 
assistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if 
Epstein rejected the deal.  Menchel told OPR he considered August 17 to be a firm deadline:  “[I]f 
you tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.”  Menchel signed and sent the 
letter on Friday, August 3, 2007, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law 
firm.92
The following Monday, August 6, 2007, Villafaña contacted Menchel by email at his new 
firm to inquire whether the letter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.  Villafaña explained 
Menchel told OPR that the timing of the letter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do 
with his impending departure from the USAO.

to OPR that she “wanted to know whether this letter went out.  Because . . . if the letter didn’t go 
out we can make this all go away and restart.”  Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the letter 
out by email.   
Later that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood 
Epstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.  
Villafaña told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not 
to prosecute Epstein federally.  Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like 
[Villafaña] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”93 
C. 
August – September 2007:  Epstein Hires Additional Attorneys, Who Meet 
with Acosta 
1. 
Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Attorneys  
Villafaña told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with 
them and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer.  Around this time, 
Epstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkowitz, two prominent attorneys from the law 
firm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate 
at the firm.94  On the evening of August 6, 2007, Sloman emailed Acosta:  “Just saw Menchel.  I 
didn’t know Kirkland made a call into you.  You were right.  Unbelievable.”  During their OPR 
interviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could 
provide no additional information about the contact.95  A reply email from Acosta to Sloman 
indicates that the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys were considering elevating to the Department their 
objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein matter.  In that email, Acosta stated, “They 
are likely to go to DC.  We should strategize a bit.  We are not changing positions, and that should 
be made clear.”   
The next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman: 
[Epstein’s] attorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds 
of a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them.  I’m concerned 
that this will delay matters. 
I am thinking of heading this off, by (i) agreeing to meet to discuss 
general legal policy only (the only matter in which DC has arguable 
In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s 
a tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.”  The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not 
remember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the 
case and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict?  Why don’t we just move forward?”   
Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September 1995 to March 1997, he 
had worked on at least one matter each with Starr and Lefkowitz, and since that time, he had professional 
acquaintanceships with both.   
Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which 
he entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,” 
and told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.   

jurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the 
details of the case, and (ii) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to 
participate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting. 
Thoughts? 
Acosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and 
that “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop 
this case.”96 
2. 
Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are 
Postponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaña’s Efforts to 
Obtain the Computer Evidence 
On August 8, 2007, Villafaña informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterbaan, who 
was willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after 
August 21, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August 17th 
deadline.”  Villafaña also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York 
and to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there.  Noting that “there was 
some concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a 
plea,” Villafaña asked Acosta for guidance.  Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that 
the USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.”  Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval 
authority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allow the defense to keep arguing this [case] to 
different agencies.”  Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhow, if we don’t 
meet with them.  I’d rather keep it here.  Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so.  If our 
deadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.” 
As a result, the investigative steps were postponed.  On August 10, 2007, Villafaña emailed 
Lourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could 
oppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain 
Epstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team.  Villafaña was 
reluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl 
who began seeing Epstein at age 14 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.  
On August 13, 2007, Villafaña advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of 
the litigation.  However, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2007, and obtained his 
agreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel, 
which was scheduled for September 7, 2007.    
Villafaña told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation 
concerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”97   Villafaña 
suspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”  
In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the 
NPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the 
case because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the matter.   
Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist 
“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”   

She believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating 
position, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.”  Villafaña said she did not 
understand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.  
Instead, they instructed Villafaña to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation 
proceedings.  
Sloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what 
the thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafaña was “ordered to stand 
down.”  Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafaña’s effort to 
obtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it.  Lourie, however, told 
OPR that the computers might have contained “very powerful evidence” that possibly “could have 
changed our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.”  In his OPR interview, Menchel was 
uncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknowledged to OPR, 
“You always want more as a prosecutor.” 
On August 31, 2007, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2007 meeting with 
defense counsel that he planned to attend, CEOS Chief Oosterbaan traveled to West Palm Beach 
to meet with Villafaña and the case agents and to examine the case file.  He explained to OPR that 
he wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the 
interests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.  
According to Villafaña, during his review of the file, Oosterbaan told her that the case was “really 
good” and offered to assist Villafaña at trial.   
On September 6, 2007, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent 
Villafaña an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection.  What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”  
Sloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was 
involved in “a hundred other things” at that time.98  Villafaña sent Sloman the term sheet and 
explained to him, “You and Matt [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an 
Information charging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I think Matt 
must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.”  Villafaña continued: 
There are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow.  First, 
that there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting 
because it is strategically important that we indict before the end of 
September, which means . . . September 25th.  Second, the agents 
and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which 
as Drew [Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the 
law.  And third, I do not want to make any promises about allowing 
Epstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good 
chance of getting him detained.99 
Sloman noted that with the attention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only 
case [in the office], but there were other cases.”   
As Villafaña explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government 
may have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond.  Contrary to Villafaña’s assertion in the email, 
the CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in 

Villafaña added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would 
report that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to know if 
the victims had been consulted about the deal.”  Sloman forwarded Villafaña’s email to Acosta 
with a note that read simply, “fyi.”   
Later that evening, Villafaña circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterbaan two alternative 
documents:  a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.100  The draft federal plea agreement, 
following the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy 
under 18 U.S.C. § 371 to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration 
as a sexual offender, with a Rule 11(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment.  The draft 
NPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 31, 2007, and called for Epstein to 
enter a state plea by September 28, 2007.  Villafaña told OPR that because she had never seen a 
non-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the 
Department’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the 
use of non-prosecution agreements.101 
3. 
September 7, 2007:  Acosta, Other USAO Attorneys, and FBI 
Supervisors Meet with Epstein Attorneys Starr, Lefkowitz, and 
Sanchez 
On Friday, September 7, 2007, Acosta, Sloman, Villafaña, Villafaña’s co-counsel, 
Oosterbaan, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office 
with defense attorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkowitz.102  This was Acosta’s 
first meeting with Epstein’s defense team.  Villafaña understood the purpose of this meeting was 
to afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be 
prosecuted federally.  Villafaña recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived, 
Acosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case. 
Acosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to 
present their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism.  Villafaña 
similarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case 
should remain a state matter in which the USAO should not interfere.  Both Villafaña and her 
co-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held 
Senate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the 
only people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.”  Acosta did 
not recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going 
Chapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in matters in which 
the government did not pursue a federal charge.  The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the 
Department’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.         
100 
The initial draft NPA is attached as Exhibit 2 to this Report. 
101  
OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied. 
102  
Lourie was not present.  During September 2007, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C., 
as he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff to the head 
of the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher.  He served in that detail until he left 
the Department in February 2008.  

forward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.  
The September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”103 
Villafaña told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the 
federal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required 
sexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the 
U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims.  When defense counsel 
objected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal 
for a sentence of home confinement.  In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterbaan reported 
that the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might 
approach Criminal Division Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument 
directly to her.  
VI. 
SEPTEMBER 2007:  THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE 
PROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED  
Acosta had dispensed with the August 17, 2007 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s 
August 3, 2007 letter, in order to allow the defense to meet with him.  After that meeting, and 
although Villafaña continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was 
established, and the negotiations continued through most of September.   
The defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions.  Because Acosta was 
not willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means 
through which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of 
imprisonment.  As the contemporaneous emails show, the USAO did not hold to its position that 
a two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept.  To reach an 
agreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either 
federal or state court, or both, and Villafaña spent considerable time and effort working with 
defense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes.  In the course of that 
process, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of 18 months, with 
the understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just 15 
months.      
A. 
The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 20 Months 
Shortly after the September 7, 2007 meeting, Epstein attorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had 
not been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer, 
proposing that Epstein serve 15 months in jail followed by 15 months in home confinement.  On 
the afternoon of Monday, September 10, 2007, Villafaña emailed Sloman, identifying issues she 
wanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a 
resolution that would allow Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender 
registration.  Villafaña stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light 
of our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really low sentence.”  Villafaña 
103  
Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the 
USAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.   

noted that the revised charges involved 19 victims, so the defense proposal for a 15-month sentence 
amounted to less than one month per victim.  Villafaña requested that “whatever the U.S. Attorney 
decides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follow . . . a version of my written non-
prosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a 
strict timeline.” 
Later that day, Villafaña circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a 
20-month jail sentence to be followed by 10 months of home confinement.  This redrafted NPA 
contained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least  
months in a state correctional institution.”104  Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended 
it to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with 
the State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.”  Villafaña sent her version of the 
revised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the 
following day, after she learned of it.    
On September 11, 2007, the court contacted Villafaña to inquire whether the USAO would 
be prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the following day.  At 
Sloman’s direction, Villafaña asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for 
the following week.  At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafaña 
circulated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterbaan, seeking their feedback before 
sending it “through the chain of command.”  Villafaña also sent Oosterbaan the revised NPA and 
told him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the 
USAO’s offer.  Oosterbaan responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s 
understandable.”105   
That afternoon, Lourie asked Villafaña, “What is our latest offer?”  Villafaña responded, 
“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 30-month sentence, split 20 in jail and 10 in 
‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.  We also put in 
deadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”    
B. 
September 12, 2007:  The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State 
Attorney 
Although the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal 
investigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State 
Attorney’s Office in those discussions until September 12, 2007.  On that day, Lourie, Villafaña, 
and another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West 
Palm Beach office, and Epstein attorneys Lefkowitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State 
Attorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek.  Other than Villafaña, 
few of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it.  The available evidence 
indicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.   
104  
Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.   
105  
Oosterbaan told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement 
with it.”   

Villafaña told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did 
not think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek.  Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed 
concern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing.  According to Villafaña, Belohlavek 
explained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s 
sentencing guidelines, and that it would be better for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled 
guilty to just one of the three counts.  Villafaña recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that 
Epstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges, 
Lourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allow Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge 
in addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense attorneys selected the charge of 
procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.106  Lourie, however, disputed Villafaña’s 
recollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had 
the authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally.107   
During the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state 
prison.  Villafaña also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the 
meeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during 
the entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local 
facility.  Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county 
facility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than 12 months, so 
that, for example, consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months—totaling 18 months—could be 
served in the county jail.  Villafaña told OPR: 
Our thing was incarceration 24 hours a day.  So during this meeting, 
I remember [the defense] talking about . . . a one year count followed 
by a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to 
back but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.  
But then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round 
the clock incarceration.”  And Barry Krischer said yes.  And [he] 
said that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he 
would be kept in solitary confinement. 
Villafaña did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an 18-month sentence during that 
meeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allowing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county 
jail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.   
Neither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details 
of the September 12, 2007 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember 
the meeting at all.  Krischer did, however, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned 
of the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment 
and an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein 
“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was 
106  
Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not 
involve sexual offender registration.   
107  
As noted below, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafaña spoke 
with Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement. 

going to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he 
hadn’t done up to this point.”  Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that down?”  Krischer also noted 
that at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that 
“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”108       
Acosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September 12 
meeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only 
one charge.  Acosta told OPR, however, that he recognized that Villafaña and Lourie needed “some 
degree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose 
a concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein 
ultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.     
Although Epstein’s attorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county 
facility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s attorneys alternatively expressed interest in 
Epstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state 
resolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence 
running concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.  
Later that day, Villafaña sent Lefkowitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with 
Acosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”109  The next day, 
September 13, 2007, Villafaña sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors, 
identifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence.  Villafaña also emailed 
defense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title 18”—referring 
to the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any 
federal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.   
C. 
The Evidence Does Not Clearly Show Why the Term of Incarceration Was 
Reduced from 24 Months to 20 Months to 18 Months 
OPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafaña, and Lourie to 
explain how the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to 18 
months.  Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was 
reduced.  Villafaña and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.   
Villafaña told OPR:   
We had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it 
going to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it 
going to be a federal charge?  And to get to a federal charge, there 
was no way to do 24 months that made any sense.  So somehow it 
ended up being 20 months and then it got to be 18 months.  And 
these were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkowitz was 
108  
Belohlavek, however, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated 
state crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.  
109  
The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”  

having directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to 18 
months. 
Villafaña further explained to OPR: 
Regarding going from 24 months to 20 months, I recall a discussion 
that 24 months of federal time was really 20 months after gain time, 
so Epstein should be allowed to plead to 20 months’ in the state.  
Epstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like 
that in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed.  Later, of course, 
as shown in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkowitz) got 
Alex to agree that Epstein should be allowed to earn gain time in the 
[s]tate, so the 20 months in the state became at least 17 months.   
Regarding going from 20 months’ to 18 months, . . . this came from 
a negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where 
the federal statutory max could only be 24 or 18, so 18 was agreed 
to.  I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they 
wanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked 
Alex why we didn’t return to 20 months because the reason why we 
went to 18 months was because that was the only way to end up with 
a federal statutory maximum.110 
However, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s attorneys, 
drafted by Villafaña for Acosta several weeks after the September 12, 2007 meeting with the State 
Attorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction 
in the amount of jail time – from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months down to eighteen 
months, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.” 
Acosta also noted to OPR that Villafaña was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing 
to allow her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-
guessing” her.  Acosta acknowledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.” 
Based on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, how, or by whom the 
decision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to 18 months.  It 
is possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allow 
him to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ attempts 
to reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater 
than what had been discussed with respect to state charges.  In the end, the evidence shows that 
Acosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to 18 months, and the USAO 
understood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount 
of time Epstein would spend incarcerated.   
110  
By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafaña referred to 12-month and 6-month misdemeanors.    

D. 
The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to 
Federal Charges 
During the remainder of September, Villafaña conducted plea negotiations and drafted the 
final NPA, mainly with Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz.  In a September 13, 2007 email to CEOS 
Chief Oosterbaan, Villafaña reported that the plea negotiations were “getting fast and furious.”  
She said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make 
payments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for 
damages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.” 
According to the email documentation, by Friday, September 14, 2007, the parties had 
moved toward a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which 
would allow Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.  
Villafaña informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkowitz 
had resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges:  harassment to 
prevent a witness from reporting a crime (18 U.S.C. § 1512(d)(2), which was then a one-year 
misdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5), a six-month 
misdemeanor).  Villafaña reported that Lefkowitz “put in a pitch for only 12 months, I put in a 
pitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 20-month recommendation, and we decided that we would 
be stuck with the 18 months.”   
Later that day, Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information 
mirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had 
“not yet been blessed” by them.  The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the 
two federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the 
statutory maximum penalty of 18 months’ imprisonment followed by 2 years of supervised release, 
and that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to 
engage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Attorney’s Office would make a joint, 
binding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 20 months in prison followed by 10 
months of community control (home confinement).  Although not specified in the draft agreement, 
the negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently.   In addition 
to payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the 
victims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 40—who 
elected to file suit for damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  A guardian ad litem would be appointed 
to communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf. 
Lourie, however, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal.  In response 
to Villafaña’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafaña sent the proposal to 
Lefkowitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of 
silly.”111  Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault 
charge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.”  Acosta responded, “If we 
need[,] let’s find a different charge.”  On Saturday, September 15, 2007, Villafaña emailed 
Lefkowitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “gotten some negative reaction 
111  
The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female 
assistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”     

to the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.112  At 
this point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafaña that in his absence 
Lourie had agreed “to help finalize this.”  Lourie spent the following work week at his new post 
at the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone 
and email.  
In a Sunday, September 16, 2007 email, Villafaña informed Lefkowitz that she had drafted 
a factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal.  In that email, Villafaña 
also noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which 
will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.”  This email received considerable attention 12 
years later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of 
the USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims.  Villafaña, however, explained to OPR 
that she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy.  She told 
OPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into 
the courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity 
was less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens 
in Palm Beach.”     
Lefkowitz responded to Villafaña with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid” 
plea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.”  Significantly, this defense proposal 
introduced two new provisions.  The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly 
facilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme.  The defense sought a government promise not to 
prosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego 
immigration proceedings against two of the female assistants: 
Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also 
precludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might 
otherwise in the future be brought against [four named female 
assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate 
entity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal 
investigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be 
instituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the 
ongoing investigation.  
The second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers: 
Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement 
resolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested 
witness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or 
computers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the 
Agreement.  Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the 
execution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable 
112  
Villafaña told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring 
at nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a 
time when out of office access to email was very limited.”  Records show her supervisors were aware that at times she 
used her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case. 

evidence of a violation of the agreement.  Epstein and his counsel 
agree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will 
be safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or 
their agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are 
fulfilled. 
Later that day, Villafaña sent Lefkowitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had 
suggested:  “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an 18-month sentence, 
or pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges.  Villafaña also told 
Lefkowitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy 
with a Rule 11(c) binding recommendation for a 20-month sentence.  Villafaña explained: 
As to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be 
sentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but 
not that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his 
federal time.  Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be 
addressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the 
judge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison 
purposes.   
With regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafaña suggested standard 
federal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will 
mention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes 
and all of the other persons that we could charge.”  Villafaña told OPR that she was willing to 
include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood 
to be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in 
prosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea.  Villafaña told OPR, “[W]e considered 
Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone 
else.”  She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed 
individuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern.  Villafaña also told 
OPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge” 
related to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct, 
the court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been 
charged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s attorneys might claim the 
agreement was breached.113   
With regard to immigration, Villafaña told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any 
position in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that 
either of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had committed fraud in connection with 
their immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status.  So there wasn’t any reason 
113  
OPR understood Villafaña’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry 
into additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to 
influence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.  

for them to be deported.”114  As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of 
having committed crimes, Villafaña told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal 
apart from actual prosecution. 
Villafaña concluded her email to Lefkowitz by expressing disappointment that they were 
not “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work 
on the agreement: 
Can I suggest that tomorrow we either meet live or via 
teleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick 
phone call, to hash out these items?  I was hoping to work only a 
half day tomorrow to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if 
necessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet.  If you want to meet 
“off campus” somewhere, that is fine.  I will make sure that I have 
all the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.115 
Villafaña told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkowitz away from the USAO because conducting 
negotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafaña wanted “to have a meeting where we sat down 
and just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel better if you 
go to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting. 
On the morning of Monday, September 17, 2007, the USAO supervisor who was taking 
over Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafaña for an update on 
the plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkowitz the previous 
afternoon.  Villafaña told the manager, “As you can see . . . there are a number of things in their 
last draft that were unacceptable.  All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”   
Shortly thereafter, Villafaña alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just 
spoken with Lefkowitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning towards a plea to state charges under 
a non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkowitz “our last version of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement.”  Acosta asked that Villafaña “make sure they know it[’]s only a 
draft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.”  Villafaña responded, 
“Absolutely.  There were a lot of problems with their last attempt.  They tried to re-open all the 
loopholes that I had sewn shut.”  Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz the draft NPA that she had provided 
to Lefcourt on September 11, 2007, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him] 
having to reinvent the wheel.”  She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations, 
noting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th 
[to bring charges] . . . , no matter what.”   
After receiving the draft NPA, Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to provide for his review a factual 
proffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f 
114  
According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the 
beginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of 
any foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.   
115  
Lefkowitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.    

we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”  
Villafaña replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly 
accessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part 
of our case file.  It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request, 
but it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”116  Villafaña told 
OPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want 
people to believe him to have committed a variety of crimes.”  As she explained to OPR, Villafaña 
believed the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the 
victims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages. 
E. 
The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges 
Negotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September 18, 2007.  Responding to 
Villafaña’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkowitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge 
with a 12-month sentence, followed by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home 
detention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be 
served under community control.  Villafaña replied, “I know that the U.S. Attorney will not go 
below 18 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).”  Shortly 
thereafter, Villafaña emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager: 
Hi all – I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with 
Mr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution.  As I 
mentioned yesterday, I spent about 12 hours over the weekend 
drafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing 
factual proffers.  I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from 
them yesterday, which never arrived.  At that time, they were 
leaning towards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the 
time in state custody. 
Late last night I talked to Jay Lefkowitz who asked about Epstein 
pleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail 
time being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.  I 
told him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest 
of full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible 
because he will not be in Zone A or B.117  This morning Jay 
Lefkowitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get 
Mr. Epstein down to 14 months, then he thought he would be 
eligible. 
My response:  have him plead to two separate Informations.  On the 
first one he gets 12 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets

FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permitting the 
government to withhold the requested records.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552.

alternatives to imprisonment. 

twelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run 
consecutively. 
I just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do 12 
months imprisonment instead. 
As you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing 
jail time.  I would like to send Jay Lefkowitz an e-mail stating that 
if we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrow at 5:00, 
negotiations will end.  I have selected tomorrow at 5:00 because it 
gives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are 
serious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish 
holiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I 
plan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review 
the indictment package. 
Do you concur? 
A few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that 
Lourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”118   
Within moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafaña, reporting that he 
had just spoken with Lefkowitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap) 
with nonbinding recommendation for 18 months.  When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state 
offenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community 
confinement.”  By reply email, Villafaña asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether 
they spoke. 
F. 
Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of 
the Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects 
Approximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with 
Lefkowitz, Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a revised draft plea agreement.  Despite the agreement Lourie 
believed he and Lefkowitz had reached that morning, Lefkowitz’s proposal would have resulted 
in a 16-month federal sentence followed by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of 
home detention.  Lefkowitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the 
USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration 
proceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.   
Villafaña circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other 
supervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were 
“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.”  Villafaña also pointed 
out that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines 
118  
The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-
forth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to 
have a direct conversation with Epstein.  

and had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can 
keep all of his information confidential.  I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was 
unacceptable to our office.”   Of even greater significance, in a follow-up email, Villafaña noted 
that the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and 
the entire provision relating to monetary damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.   
In the afternoon, Villafaña circulated her own proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first 
internally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the 18/12 split that Jay and 
Andy agreed to,” and then to Lefkowitz.  Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she 
included the following provision:  “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the 
defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal 
conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including 
but not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution. 
In her email to Lefkowitz, transmitting the plea agreement, Villafaña wrote:  
Could you share the attached draft with your colleagues.  It is in 
keeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative 
“deal.”  The U.S. Attorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the 
language, but he agrees with it in principle.  
. . . . 
[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:00. 
. . .  One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit down 
together in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna 
[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a 
signed document. 
Villafaña also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s 
attorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final 
approval.  Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations.  I’d rather leave it to you 
if that’s ok.”  Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was 
important for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in 
September, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think 
your trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.”  Villafaña told OPR, however, that she did not 
understand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she 
believed Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have 
an appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”119  Villafaña replied to Acosta’s 
119  
As noted throughout the Report, Villafaña’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions 
often differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.  Because it involved subjective interpretations of 
individuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them 
as an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.  See Chapter Two, Part Three, 
Section V.E.  

message, “That is fine.  [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything down, we just 
want to get a final blessing.”   
Negotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September 19, 2007, with 
Villafaña and Lefkowitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the 
scheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms.   During that exchange, Villafaña 
made clear to Lefkowitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end: 
I hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by 
Monday.  I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this 
has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall 
apart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the 
negotiations.  I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page 
indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these 
negotiations.  There has to be an ending date, and that date is 
Monday. 
Early that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his 
new post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafaña to furnish him with the last 
draft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “18/12 
split” draft she had sent to Lefkowitz the prior afternoon.  After reviewing that draft, Lourie told 
Villafaña it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the 
USAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be 
in the plea agreement.  Villafaña told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence” 
of the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.”   Villafaña explained to OPR that she held 
this view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was 
resolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.” 
At 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkowitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea 
agreement showing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic] 
prosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.”  The defense 
redline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor 
counts of attempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state 
indictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of 
coercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.04 (without regard 
to age).  Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration.  Epstein 
would serve an 18-month sentence and a concurrent 60 months on probation on the state charges.  
The redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and 
replaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court.   It 
retained language proposed by Villafaña, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal 
criminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida 
growing out of any criminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this 
plea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants 
and the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration 
proceedings.  It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a 
presentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and 
withdraw all pending legal process. 

G. 
Villafaña and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges 
That They “Try to Work It Out” 
In the late afternoon of Wednesday, September 19, 2007, Villafaña expressed her 
increasing frustration to her supervisors.  She emailed the defense redline version of the plea 
agreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions 
she had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into 
the agreement.”  (Emphasis in original).  Villafaña opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”  
Lourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”   
Lourie immediately emailed Acosta the following: 
I looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkowitz] and I must agree 
with Marie.  Based on my own conversations with him, his draft is 
out of left field.  He claims to orally agree to our terms and then 
sends us a document that is the opposite.  I suggest we simply tell 
him that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move 
forward with our case. 
Acosta replied: 
Why don’t we just call him.  Tell him 
1. 
You agree, and then change things. 
2. 
That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith.  Stop it or we’ll 
indict. 
3. 
Try to work it out. 
It seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what 
has to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics. 
Acosta explained to OPR that he recognized,  
[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact 
that you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make 
it less of a right position.  You tell them stop being annoying, you 
try to work it out, and if not, then you indict. 
In response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.”  He also forwarded to 
Acosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafaña had sent to 
Lefkowitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafaña earlier that 
afternoon.  
Meanwhile, Villafaña sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft 
message she proposed to send to Lefkowitz with her objections to the defense revisions, 
explaining, “I know that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on 

everything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations 
until he sees the Indictment and shows up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.”  She suggested 
charging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense, 
superseding with additional charges and going to trial.  She complained that after seven weeks of 
negotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.”  Her proposed email to Lefkowitz detailed all of 
the objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these, 
there can be no plea agreement.”   
H. 
Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaña Sends a Final Version 
to the Defense 
The next day, Thursday, September 20, 2007, Villafaña emailed Assistant State Attorney 
Belohlavek and informed her: 
Our deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and 
arraignment in the federal system.  At this time, things don’t look 
promising anyway, but I will keep you posted.  In their latest draft, 
they changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from 
solicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to 
forcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense).  We will 
not budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a 
mutually acceptable agreement.  If that changes, I will let you know. 
Acosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid” 
federal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems 
very straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the 
defense.120  Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not 
typically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should 
only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.”121  Lourie forwarded the email 
to Villafaña with a transmittal message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.  
Please try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as 
final to Jay.”  Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafaña that he believed the defense would want 
to go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement.  When Villafaña 
sent the revised plea agreement to Lefkowitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the 
defense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to 
him on September 17, 2007, would control.   
120  
The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had 
substantially diverged.  
121  
The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the 
name of the U.S. Attorney.  In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an 
opportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go 
forward with it.”   

I. 
The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA 
“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender 
Registration Requirement 
After having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement, 
by the afternoon of September 20, 2007, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties 
resumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.  
Through multiple emails and attempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other 
supervisors, defense attorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a 
state charge requiring sexual offender registration.     
After receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkowitz spoke with Villafaña.  She reported 
to Acosta and Lourie that Lefkowitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-
only agreement” and wanted until the middle of the following week to work out the details, but 
that she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrow [Friday] or we 
are [filing charges] on Tuesday.”   
Lefkowitz emailed Villafaña about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out 
that it called for a 20-month jail sentence followed by 10 months of community control, rather than 
months in jail and 12 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility” 
on the § 2255 procedure.  Villafaña responded: 
The 18 and 12 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is 
not a problem.  On the issue about 18 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to 
be miles apart.  Your most recent version not only had me binding 
the girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also 
promising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.  
I reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments 
on some of your other changes.  In the context of a non-prosecution 
agreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not 
pursuing charges against others.  However, as I stated on Sunday, 
the Office cannot and will not bind Immigration. 
Also, your timetable will need to move up significantly.  As [State 
Attorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office 
can put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you 
all before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day. 
Villafaña alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and 
that defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not 
concurrent state and federal.”  She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to 
[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”   
In response to Villafaña’s report of her conversation with Lefkowitz about the defense 
preference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of 
[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.”  Lourie emailed Acosta: 

I think Jay [Lefkowitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable 
offense.  Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us 
down in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an 
offense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and 
touted that we should be happy because it was registrable.  For that 
reason alone, I don’t think we should consider allowing them to 
come down from their own offer, either on this issue or on time of 
incarceration. 
Lefkowitz attempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafaña to return the 
call, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel.  Lourie 
instructed Villafaña, “U can tell [J]ay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.” 
On the morning of Friday, September 21, 2007, Villafaña emailed Acosta informing him 
that “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the 
charging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in 
the Miami office needed to review it.  Villafaña also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that 
morning to Lefkowitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required 
sexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek 
“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”   
That same morning, Epstein attorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations 
for several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only 
one issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that 
would assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign 
as soon as today.”  From his out-of-town vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who 
replied, “Enjo[y] vacation.  Working with [M]arie on this.”  Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s 
email to Lourie and asked, “Do you know what she’s talking about?”  Lourie responded that 
Sanchez “has not been in any negotiations.  Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”   
J. 
The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”  
Lefkowitz, in the meantime, sent Villafaña a revised draft NPA that proposed an 18-month 
sentence in the county jail, followed by 12 months of community control, and restored the 
provision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek 
reimbursement by filing suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255.”  This defense draft retained the 
provision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed 
employees of the specific Epstein-owned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any 
potential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.  
This language had evolved from similar language that Villafaña had included in the USAO’s 
earlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.122  Lefkowitz also again included the sentence 
122  
The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal 
criminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any 
criminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] . . . .”    

precluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings 
against the two assistants who were foreign nationals. 
At this point, Lefkowitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email:  “I am 
happy to talk.  My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my 
staff by allowing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.]  I’ll have 
her set something up.” 
Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz her own revised NPA, telling him it was her “attempt at 
combining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.”  She inserted solicitation 
of minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would 
plead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 30-month sentence, divided into 18 months 
in the county jail and 12 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.123  
Villafaña’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal 
process in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it 
to apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and 
deleting mention of the corporate entity employees.  Finally, Villafaña deleted mention of 
immigration proceedings, but advised in her transmittal email that “we have not and don’t plan to 
ask immigration” proceedings to be initiated.124   
Later that day, Villafaña alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C. 
early that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and 
co-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding 
promises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.”  There is no 
documentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement 
with Villafaña’s assessment.  Rather, within a few minutes, Villafaña re-sent her email, adding 
that defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which 
Lourie responded, “No way.  We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.”  Villafaña replied 
to Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other 
thoughts?”  When Lourie gave no further response, Villafaña informed defense counsel that Lourie 
had rejected the proposed immigration language.   
OPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential 
co-conspirators.”  Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left 
that provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some 
way.  In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential 
co-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were 
co-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme.  Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t 
going to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in 
123  
Villafaña noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a 
hospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an 
unlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”   
124  
Villafaña gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had 
been involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafaña believed the agent knew two of 
Epstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information.  Villafaña 
also said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.   

federal court.  Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision 
was meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s 
conduct.  Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to 
prominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals, 
Sloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was 
directed toward any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked 
with Epstein.125  Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it.  He speculated 
that if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafaña and Lourie had 
“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.”  The West Palm Beach manager, who had 
only limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he 
had “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it. 
Villafaña told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had 
not developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators.  So, . . . we wouldn’t be 
prosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? . . .  I just didn’t think that there was anybody 
that it would cover.”  She conceded, however, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read 
as broadly as people have since read it.” 
K. 
The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender 
Registration Requirement  
On the afternoon of Friday, September 21, 2007, State Attorney Krischer informed 
Villafaña that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the 
terms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration.  According to Krischer, defense 
counsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal 
law enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.  
Krischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back 
from him.  Villafaña responded, “I think Alex is calling you now.”  Villafaña told OPR that, to her 
knowledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term.126 
Later that afternoon, Villafaña emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain 
time” Epstein would earn in state prison.  Villafaña explained in her email that she wanted to 
include a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain 
number of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison 
authorities to let him out early.”  Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood, 
Epstein would serve 15 months.  He also told Villafaña that a plea to a registrable offense would 
not prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention 
facility.127   
125  
Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have 
been prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Attorney’s] office in the country.”   
126  
Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein 
case or any other matter.  
127  
The State Attorney concluded his email:  “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in 
writing.  After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.”  Villafaña 
responded, “Sounds great.”  When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafaña said:  “Everybody 

At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkowitz by phone regarding the need for 
Epstein to plead to a registrable offense.  Throughout the weekend, with Villafaña’s Monday 
deadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement.  On 
Saturday, September 22, 2007, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie.  In the first, she provided 
details from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to 
child sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation.  She noted that she “spoke to 
[M]att [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her.  Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy 
email, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against 
registration [as a sexual offender] in this case.”  In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been 
a “miscommunication” during the September 12, 2007 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the 
solicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was 
NOT registrable.”  Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life 
sentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose 
“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.”  She listed numerous 
reasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of 
sexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked” 
without registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state 
registration requirements.  A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie 
“in case you want to speak to him directly.” 
In another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again 
because “you are a very fair person.  This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable.  [I]t is a 
result of a misunderstanding at a meeting.”  She stated that Epstein’s attorneys had “consistently 
emphasized their goal of 18 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable 
offense precluded” a camp designation.  Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly 
inconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that 
meeting.”  Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will 
eventually be proud of.  Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.” 
Lourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone 
conversation.  By email late that night, at 10:26 p.m., Lefkowitz asked Lourie to phone him. 
The next day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña—
to “follow up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that 
Epstein plead to a registrable offense.  Lefkowitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding” 
at the September 12, 2007 meeting: 
Before the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex 
prosecutor for 13 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not 
a registerable offense.  However, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable 
offense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken 
assumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to 
the Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge. 
has offered to buy me a cup of coffee.  I have had coffee with no one.”  Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which 
he referred related to the pressure he had been getting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.   

Lefkowitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why 
registration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.”  In the event 
that Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkowitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate 
that the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist 
sentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors.  As Lefkowitz 
further argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist 
sentencing for the humiliation of registration.”  Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta, 
Lourie, and Villafaña discussed the matter in a conference call.   
Lefkowitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafaña that omitted identification of 
the charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.  Later that day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta: 
I got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal. 
Does that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit 
now to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his 18 month 
sentence and then be sentenced to 12 month[s] community control 
for that charge?  I thought that was exactly what you proposed 
[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some 
kind of federal charge).   
But that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 30 months total, 
and 18 in jail.   
How can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is 
not unduly endangered in jail? 
Acosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the 
AUSAs assigned to the case.”  Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafaña, and 
they had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.”  Acosta copied Villafaña, 
and she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”   
L. 
The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause 
Throughout that Sunday evening, Lefkowitz had numerous email exchanges with 
Villafaña, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.) 
and Villafaña.  Later that evening, Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a new version of the NPA that, for the 
first time, included a confidentiality term:   
It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be 
disseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order.  In the 
event the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to 
a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the 
Government agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure 
of this Agreement.  
After making additional revisions, Villafaña sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the 
“final” version, asking Acosta to let her know what he thought of it.  Among her revisions, she 
changed the confidentiality provision to the following:   

The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of 
any public record.  If the United States receives a Freedom of 
Information Act request or any compulsory process commanding 
the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein 
before making that disclosure.128 
VII. 
SEPTEMBER 24, 2007:  ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS 
SIGNED 
The contemporaneous emails show that Villafaña continued to update Acosta as the parties 
negotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA.  Shortly after midnight 
on Monday, September 24, 2007, Acosta sent Villafaña “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had 
sent to him.  Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the 
State Attorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein 
enter his guilty plea by a certain date.  Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with 
requiring the State Attorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a 
State court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing.  Accordingly, 
Acosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing 
recommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty 
plea and be sentenced by the specified dates.  Acosta also instructed Villafaña to restore a reference 
to Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.”  Lourie, 
who had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with 
Lefkowitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafaña.  Villafaña sent 
a new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkowitz later that morning.   
On the afternoon of September 24, 2007, Villafaña circulated the new “final” version of 
the NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkowitz to send her the 
signed agreement.  After Lefkowitz electronically transmitted to Villafaña a copy of the NPA 
signed by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel:  “They have scanned 
and emailed the signed agreement.  It is done.”   
In his transmittal email, Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to “[p]lease do whatever you can to 
keep this from becoming public.”  Villafaña responded: 
I have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West 
Palm Beach manager].  I don’t anticipate it going any further than 
that.  When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy 
to you.  The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept 
confidential since it also contains identifying information about the 
girls. 
When we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for 
the girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the 
128  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged 
co-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before 
disclosing the NPA.   

agreement.  I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when 
a resolution was achieved. . . .  [The West Palm Beach manager] is 
calling, but [he] knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the money 
issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and 
the amount of time that has been agreed to.  [He] also is telling Chief 
Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone. 
OPR questioned Villafaña about this email.  She explained that she generally kept 
confidential the terms of the resolution of any case.  She understood that “the way that the [Epstein] 
case was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what 
happened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to know what the agreement was about.  
Villafaña emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter 
“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet 
with the victims herself to explain how the damages provision would work.  Villafaña also told 
him that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD 
Detective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.129  Villafaña forwarded to Acosta, Lourie, 
and the West Palm Beach manager Lefkowitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA 
from becoming public.  Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public 
except as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does 
he want?”  Villafaña replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI 
or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.”  Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafaña, 
and the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and how much,” adding, 
“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.” 
The final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafaña, 
contained the following pertinent provisions:   
Charges:  
Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment, 
plus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a 
registrable offense. 
Sentence: 
The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 30-month 
sentence divided as follows:  consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months 
in the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or 
sentencing and without community control or probation, followed by  
months of community control, consecutive.130 
Damages: 
As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’ 
status as victims.  The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals 
129  
The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.  
130  
Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation 
but does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.  See Fla. Stat. § 948.01 (2007).  

it had identified as victims.131  The USAO, with the good faith approval of 
Epstein’s counsel, would select an attorney representative for the victims, 
whom Epstein would pay. 
Timing: 
Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced 
by October 26, 2007.  The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting 
to begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2008. 
Immunity: 
The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential 
co-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants. 
Other:   
Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Attorney’s 
Office to ensure compliance with this agreement.  
Epstein waived his right to appeal.  
Epstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to 
gain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any 
other inmate. 
The federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process 
held in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the 
agreement.  Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal 
process, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate 
until all the NPA terms had been satisfied.   
Breach: 
The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the 
agreement within 90 days of the expiration of the term of home 
confinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 60 days 
thereafter. 
Disclosure: 
The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of 
any public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act 
request or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it 
would provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure.132 
That evening, Lefkowitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he 
understood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly 
prejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”133  He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on 
131  
The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point.  The parties anticipated that 
the USAO would send Epstein’s attorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to 
enter his state guilty pleas. 
132  
The final NPA is attached as Exhibit 3 to this Report. 
133  
On October 3, 2007, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported 
that federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein.  According to the Post, Epstein would 
plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months,” followed 
by “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their 

this matter.”  Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does 
not find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded:  “I enjoyed it as well.  Mr. Epstein was 
fortunate to have such excellent representation.”  
VIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS 
Almost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the 
difficult negotiation process began anew.  The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous 
issues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the 
parties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of 
the attorney representative for the victims.  As negotiations regarding the damages provision 
continued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.   
A. 
September – October 2007:  Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an 
Attorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum 
The first controversy centered on the appointment of an attorney representative for the 
victims.  Initially, Villafaña reached out to a private attorney who was one of several suggested to 
her for that role.  Villafaña notified Lefkowitz that she was recommending the attorney to serve as 
the victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the 
USAO could disclose to the attorney about the case.  Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she had never 
met the attorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by 
one of the district judges in Miami.134  Over the next few days, Villafaña exchanged messages with 
the attorney about the possibility of his serving as the attorney representative.  She also exchanged 
emails with Lefkowitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the attorney.   
By this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal 
Division.  Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to 
the office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the 
provision authorizing the USAO to select an attorney representative for the victims, which he 
believed might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Instead, he proposed that a special 
master make the selection.  Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafaña 
conveyed to Lefkowitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the attorney 
representative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.135  She provided Lefkowitz with 
probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the 
understanding that he will do prison time.”  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For 
Teen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007.  ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more 
substantial prison time.  Now, Epstein’s high-powered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out 
of registering as a sex offender . . . .”  Scott Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution 
Charges:  Jeffrey Epstein may serve about 18 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. 11, 2007. 
134  
The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafaña was dating.  The defense subsequently raised this as a 
misconduct issue, alleging that Villafaña was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’ 
representative position.    
135  
In a separate email to the proposed attorney representative, Villafaña commented, “[O]f course they tell me 
this now.” 

a proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft letter to send to the 
special master explaining the procedure for selecting an attorney representative.   
Lefkowitz objected to this proposal in a letter to Villafaña, pointing out that the NPA did 
not provide for the appointment of a special master.  More importantly, Lefkowitz used the 
discussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the 
NPA or, at least, to its interpretation.  Focusing on the attorney representative, Lefkowitz argued 
that the attorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating settlements and that the attorney 
was precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated 
settlement with Epstein.  Lefkowitz proposed: 
[T]he selected attorney should evaluate the claims of each identified 
individual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then 
distribute the monies based on the strength of each case.  For those 
identified individuals who elect not to settle with Mr. Epstein, they 
may proceed on their own, but by doing so, they would not be suing 
under § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not 
continue to be represented by the selected attorney. 
Lefkowitz also objected to Villafaña’s draft letter to the special master, asserting that it was 
essential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the 
victims.  Going further, Lefkowitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims 
about the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision.  Lefkowitz 
admonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the 
case, including [the] appointment of the selected attorney and the settlement process.”   
Villafaña forwarded Lefkowitz’s letter to Sloman, complaining that the defense 
interpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I 
please just indict him [Epstein]?”  Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follow-up 
letter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the attorney representative’s role, and 
arguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’ 
civil lawsuits in the event a settlement could not be reached.  When Villafaña explained to Sloman 
her views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your 
proposal back to [Sanchez].  The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive 
between us.”  Villafaña agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we 
are getting triple-teamed.”136   
Villafaña sent Sanchez a letter regarding the roles of the special master and attorney 
representative.  The next day, October 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a six-page letter to Acosta,  as a 
“follow up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafaña’s 
view of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA.   Lefkowitz reiterated the 
defense position that the attorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating 
settlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation.  Lefkowitz claimed that a requirement 
136  
Villafaña also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a letter to 
Acosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.  Villafaña commented, 
“It appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”      

that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound 
ethical problems,” in that the attorney representative would have an incentive to reject settlement 
offers in order to incur more fees.  In addition, Lefkowitz rejected Villafaña’s view that Epstein 
had waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to settle their 
claims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are 
victims under the enumerated statutes.”  Finally, Lefkowitz again argued that the USAO should 
not discuss the settlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for 
settlement under § 2255: 
Ms. Villafaña proposes that either she or federal agents will speak 
with the [victims] regarding the settlement process.  We do not think 
it is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor 
should the FBI be their personal investigators.  Neither federal 
agents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to 
inform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of 
the attorney representative and the settlement process.  Not only 
would that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but 
Mr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to 
the [victims] at this most critical stage.  We believe it is essential 
that we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication 
to the [victims].  We further believe that communications between 
your Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate 
Rule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  The 
powers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be 
utilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.137 
Lefkowitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:30 call 
today.”138   
Villafaña was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about 
crafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an attorney representative 
and to articulate the representative’s duties.  The next day, October 11, 2007, Sloman exchanged 
emails with Lefkowitz about the text of a proposed addendum. 
B. 
October 12, 2007:  Acosta and Defense Attorney Lefkowitz Meet for Breakfast 
On the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkowitz, Acosta exchanged 
emails with Lefkowitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the following day, on October 12, 2007, at 
a Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach.  Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was previously 
scheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October 11 and to speak at the Palm 
Beach County Bench Bar conference the following midday, and that he stayed overnight at the 
Marriott.   
137  
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury matters.  
138  
OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.   

However, as with Villafaña’s publicly released emails to Lefkowitz, this meeting between 
Acosta and Lefkowitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation.  It 
was seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s attorneys 
while simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret 
agreements with the defense.  
Two letters written later in 2007 refer to the breakfast meeting.  In a December 2007 letter 
to Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkowitz at an 
October meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an attempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a 
litigious selection process.”139  In an October 23, 2007 letter from Lefkowitz to Acosta, less than 
two weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkowitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta  
assured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State 
Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or contact any of the 
identified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil 
claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; and that neither 
[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence 
Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the 
sentence does not violate state law.140 
However, two days after receiving this letter, Acosta revised a response letter drafted by 
Sloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkowitz’s claims that Acosta had promised 
not to intervene with the State Attorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or 
intervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.141  The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to 
the imposition of a gag order.  Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”142   
Acosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that 
the meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafaña had recommended “her 
boyfriend’s partner” to serve as attorney representative.143  Acosta said that “the way this was 
reported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate 
because the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.144  When asked about 
139  
In fact, Sloman and Lefkowitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast 
meeting with Lefkowitz.  It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgotten about them 
when writing the December 7, 2007 letter.   
140  
This letter is discussed further in the following section of this Report.   
141  
OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.   
142  
Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified” 
Lefkowitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting.   
143  
As noted previously, the attorney whom Villafaña recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom 
Villafaña was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafaña or the other AUSA. 
144  
For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2018 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the 
breakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s 
crimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut 
down an ongoing FBI probe . . . .”  Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump cabinet member gave 
a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.  The NPA, however, was finalized and signed 

Lefkowitz’s description of their breakfast meeting discussion, Acosta told OPR that there were 
“several instances” in which Lefkowitz and other defense counsel mischaracterized something he 
or an AUSA said, in a way that was misleading.   
Emails show that, immediately after the breakfast, Acosta phoned Sloman, who then 
emailed to Lefkowitz a revision to the Addendum language they had been negotiating and who 
also later reported to Villafaña that Lefkowitz’s “suggested revision has been rejected.”  Other 
emails show that the parties continued to be at odds about the proposed language for the NPA 
addendum for several days after the breakfast meeting.   
C. 
Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the 
Parties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Attorney Representative 
and Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum  
A week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkowitz—citing a scheduling conflict— 
sent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state 
court from October 26, 2007, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 20, 2007.  In his email, 
Lefkowitz reported that the State Attorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted 
that Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the 
state.”145  Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkowitz and agreed 
to the postponement.   
With Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in 
negotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he 
quickly came up against the problem Villafaña and Lourie had faced: the defense attorneys 
continued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed.  Between October 
and 19, 2007, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman, 
Villafaña, and Lefkowitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the 
process for selection of the attorney representative and describing which of the representative’s 
activities Epstein would be required to reimburse.  Although it appeared that progress was being 
made towards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October 19, 2007, Lefkowitz 
emailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.  
Sloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished 
this week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues.  Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York 
had filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafaña was concerned that “this may be the real 
reason for the delay in the . . . plea.  She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out 
before the guilty plea to deter others.”   Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports 
indicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an attempt to discredit the victims.   
almost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred.  OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis 
at Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2. 
145  
Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkowitz attributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta 
had taken before the NPA was signed.   As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed 
Villafaña to omit language requiring the State Attorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not 
comfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline.  During his interview, Acosta told OPR that 
“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state attorney.”    

On October 22, 2007, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkowitz had raised, rejecting some 
defense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy 
your concern.”146  Noting that the addendum and a revised letter to the special master were 
attached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded.  Alex and I believe that this is 
as far as we can go.  Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB 
tomorrow . . . .” 
Nonetheless, the next day, Lefkowitz sent Acosta a three-page letter reiterating the Epstein 
team’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA.  Lefkowitz noted, however, that 
Epstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense 
letter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].”  Lefkowitz 
added: 
I also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during 
our October 12 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with 
regard to this matter, and assured me that your Office would not 
intervene with the State Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or 
contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or 
potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; 
and that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding 
the sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, 
so long as that sentence does not violate state law.  Indeed, so long 
as Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the 
Agreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him, 
including but not limited to gain time and work release. 
Sloman forwarded the letter to Villafaña, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”  
Villafaña replied: 
Welcome to my world.  I love the way that they want to interpret 
this agreement.  
. . . .  
It also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence 
far lower than the one we agreed to.  Has anyone talked to Barry 
[Krischer] about this?  Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in 
entering the guilty plea?  We also have to contact the victims to tell 
[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an 
attorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against 
Mr. Epstein.  If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida 
Bar Rules for the selected attorney to “cold call” the girls. 
146  
The defense raised issues concerning the attorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and 
inclusion of certain victims. 

. . . .  
Why don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him? 
Acosta also weighed in, sending both Villafaña and Sloman an email with a subject line 
that read “This has to stop,” in which he stated: 
Just read the letter. 
1. 
We specifically refused to include the provision saying that 
we would not communicate.  If I recall the conference call, we told 
him we could not agree to a gag order using those words. 
2.  
The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court 
settlement.  Seems that they can’t take no.  Let’s talk re how to 
proceed.  I’m not sure we will ever agree on a letter [to the special 
master about how to select an attorney representative] at this point. 
Notwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkowitz a new 
draft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s 
terms.147   
On October 25, 2007, Sloman sent a letter to the person whom the USAO had selected to 
serve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties.  A few days later, on October 29, 
2007, Epstein and his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.148  Villafaña’s 
name was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafaña’s request, Sloman signed the 
addendum for her on behalf of the USAO.   
Villafaña later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which 
apparently related to the defense attorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial 
selection of the private attorney to assist the victims.  Villafaña explained to Sloman: 
The funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or 
spoken to [the private attorney] before I asked him if he would be 
willing to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the 
appearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and 
agreed that the Special Master would be a safer route.  I just worry 
that the defense’s attacks on me could harm the victims. 
Sloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafaña’s role in 
proposing the private attorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad 
hominem attacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have 
accomplished.” 
147  
Acosta and Villafaña were copied on this email. 
148  
The Addendum is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Report. 

D. 
Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea 
The addendum did not bring the case to conclusion.  Instead, the matter entered a new, 
protracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice.  Despite the 
fact that Epstein and his attorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing 
to senior Department managers with the goal of setting aside the NPA entirely.  Although 
ultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.  
On October 29, 2007, Villafaña emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted 
Sloman to address with Lefkowitz.  Among other things, Villafaña pointed out that the NPA 
required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply 
with the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing 
postponement from October 26 to November 20.  Responding to Lefkowitz’s attempts to limit the 
USAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafaña noted that the USAO 
needed to be able to communicate with the State Attorney’s Office and the victims’ attorney “to 
[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”   
That same day, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge 
assigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2008.  Belohlavek 
assured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that 
was agreed on by all for the sentencing.”149  Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month 
show that the USAO, the State Attorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate 
regarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2008 
date for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that 
Epstein had not agreed to any date.  Finally, after multiple communications referring to various 
potential dates, on December 7, 2007, Epstein attorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of 
Hearing, setting the case for January 4, 2008.150

Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to 
Monetary Damages for the Victims  
With Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of 
the NPA, this time within the Department.  On November 16, 2007, Epstein attorney Kenneth Starr 
called the office of Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a 
message that he was calling regarding Epstein.151  At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late 
September 2007 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff, 
returned the call.  Fisher told OPR that she had no recollection of this call, and Lourie also could

The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2007, but provided that Epstein 
could report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2008.

State v. Epstein, No. 2006-CF-9454, Notice of Hearing (Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Dec. 7, 2007).

In a meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 21, 2007, Lefkowitz informed them that Starr had placed 
a call to Fisher.   

not recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about 
Epstein’s wish to have the Department review the case.152   
On November 28, 2007, Starr requested, by letter, a meeting with Fisher.  In his letter, Starr 
argued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under 
U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case.  On the same day, Lefkowitz 
emailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision 
and alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Attorney 
General “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component” 
of the NPA.  After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr letter, Sloman forwarded it to 
Villafaña, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and how the § 2255 provision 
evolved.  Villafaña responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried 
to breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.” 
In Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterbaan, asking for his 
thoughts on defense counsel’s arguments.  At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafaña sent 
the NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterbaan.  Oosterbaan responded to Lourie that he was 
“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly 
because of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “pretty advantageous for the defendant 
and not all that helpful to the victims.”  He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney General 
would not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”  
During her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s letter or discussing it with 
Oosterbaan, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal 
prosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate.  She told OPR, however, that she 
“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it 
was signed. 
As set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafaña planned to notify the 
victims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she 
provided a draft of the notification letter to Lefkowitz for comments.  On November 29, 2007, 
Lefkowitz sent Acosta a letter complaining about the draft notification to the victims.  Lefkowitz 
asked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant 
Attorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the following week.  Internal 
emails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterbaan about his availability for a meeting with Starr, 
but both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no 
evidence that it did. 
Acosta promptly responded to Lefkowitz by letter, directing him to raise his concerns about 
victim notification with Villafaña or Sloman.  Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to 
stop the NPA from being enforced: 
152  
In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply:  “He was very nice.  Kept me on the phone 
for [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.   

[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two 
months[] ago, it has become clear that several attorneys on your 
legal team are dissatisfied with that result. 
. . . . 
[You], Professor Dershowitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr, 
former United States Attorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs. 
Black, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to 
review and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.  The 
defense team, however, after extensive negotiation, chose to adopt 
the Agreement.  Since then counsel have objected to several steps 
taken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the 
Agreement, in essence presenting collateral challenges to portions 
of the Agreement. 
It is not the intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to 
enter a plea against his wishes.  Your client has the right to proceed 
to trial.  If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes 
that it is unlawful or unfair, we stand ready to unwind the 
Agreement. 
In a separate, seven-page letter to Starr, with Villafaña’s and Sloman’s input, Acosta 
responded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 letter to Assistant Attorney General Fisher.  
Fisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the letter, 
but she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the 
Criminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”153   
In his seven-page letter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2007, Acosta wrote: 
The Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into between this Office 
and Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global 
resolution of his state and federal criminal liability.  Under this 
Agreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for 
enumerated sections of Title 18 in favor of prosecution by the State 
of Florida, provided . . . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal 
interests:  (1) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable” 
offense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a 
sufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not 
harm the interests of his victims. 
Acosta explained in the letter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims 
in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; 
no less.”  Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255 
153  
The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s letter raised issues that had not been previously 
raised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.   

provision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by 
Epstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA.  Acosta’s letter concluded: 
Although it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision 
being appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our 
prosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel 
with the option of appealing our decisions.  Indeed, although I am 
confident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I 
nonetheless directed them to consult with the subject matter experts 
in [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving 
their [charges].  I am thus surprised to read a letter addressed to 
Department Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been 
raised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in 
fact resolved, in your client’s favor. 
I am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this 
Agreement.  The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense 
counsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics 
used by the defense team.  It appears to them that as soon as 
resolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to 
challenge the resolution collaterally.  My response thus far has been 
that defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the 
client.  That said, there must be closure on this matter.  Some in our 
Office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to 
mount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even 
after Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the 
agreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind. 
. . . . 
I would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force 
the hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his 
wishes.  Your client has the right to proceed to trial.  Although time 
is of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue 
victim notification letters until this Friday . . . to provide you with 
time to review these options with your client. . . . We expect a 
written decision by [December 7, 2007] at 5 p.m., indicating 
whether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the 
Agreement. 
Acosta explained to OPR that he did not view his letter as “inviting” Departmental review, 
but he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns.  Moreover, the 
USAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have 
prompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach.  Acosta noted that defense counsel 
repeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to 
declare him in breach more difficult.  In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s letter, Starr and 
Lefkowitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Attorney General Fisher) that 

the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of 
unwinding the agreement.”   
On December 7, 2007—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2007 letter to Starr—
the defense transmitted to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum, 
signed by Epstein.154  
F. 
Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It 
and Accuse Villafaña of Improper Conduct 
1. 
December 7 and 11, 2007:  Starr and Lefkowitz Send to Acosta Letters 
and “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation 
and Villafaña 
On the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr 
and Lefkowitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent 
criminal defense attorney and former U.S. Attorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported 
improprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal 
judge and former U.S. Attorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery 
provision under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”   
Days later, on December 11, 2007, Starr sent a letter to Acosta transmitting two lengthy 
submissions authored by Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the 
“background and conduct of the investigation.”  These submissions repeated arguments previously 
raised by the defense but also asserted new issues.  In one submission, 20 pages long, Lefkowitz 
addressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized 
Villafaña for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented 
federal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State 
Attorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are 
significantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead 
guilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”155 
  Lefkowitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that 
was “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and 
interview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed 
information that “compromised the federal investigation.”  Finally, Lefkowitz criticized federal 
involvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.”  In a second, 
13-page submission, Lefkowitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the 
NPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of 
helping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial settlements.”     
154  
The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and 
Addendum to same dated October 30, 2007.” 
155  
Villafaña sent Lefkowitz a five-page letter responding to the accusations made against her personally.   

Notwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkowitz added that Epstein 
“unconditionally re-asserts his intention to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the 
NPA. 
2. 
As a Result of the Starr and Lefkowitz Submissions, the New USAO 
Criminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta 
Agrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel 
After reviewing Starr’s and Lefkowitz’s letters, Sloman notified Villafaña that “in light of 
the recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded 
Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying 
the proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafaña to provide Senior with all the state 
and FBI investigative materials.   
In the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense attorneys to 
discuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkowitz’s December 11, 2007 submissions.156  The 
meeting took place in Miami on December 14, 2007.  The defense team included Starr, 
Dershowitz, Lefcourt, and Boston attorney Martin Weinberg.  The USAO side included Acosta, 
Sloman, Villafaña, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and 
Assistant Special Agent in Charge also present.  In addition to previously raised arguments, during 
this meeting, Epstein’s attorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein 
had agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.   
3. 
The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review 
of the USAO’s Actions  
Shortly after the December 14, 2007 meeting, Lefkowitz notified Acosta that if the issues 
raised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative 
but to seek review in Washington.”  Acosta notified Assistant Attorney General Fisher that the 
defense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and 
“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”  
Starr and Lefkowitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy letter, with numerous previously submitted 
defense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought 
a “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.”  The 
letter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under 
state law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was 
“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a 
claim” under the statute.   
156  
As Assistant Attorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr 
would speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrow issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.  Acosta 
had the Starr and Lefkowitz submissions of December 11 forwarded to Fisher. 

100 
4. 
Acosta Attempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning 
Monetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It 
Acosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255 
provision.  He sent to Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he 
proposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section.  Mandelker 
forwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and 
Acosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer.  On December 19, 2007, after Acosta and 
Sloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkowitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a letter 
proposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language 
of the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read: 
Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an 
offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she 
would have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense.  For purposes of implementing 
this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to 
name . . . as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.  Any 
judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority 
determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, 
shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these 
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.  
Acosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the 
defense delays.157 
Lefkowitz responded by letter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised 
“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when 
attempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”158  In a follow-up 
letter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry 
of his guilty plea, Lefkowitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct 
cause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made 
and will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as 
possible.” 
Acosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly 
frustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “11th hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the 
157  
As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter also addressed defense objections 
to notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.   
158  
After Starr and Lefkowitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkowitz sent a second letter 
to Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and 
becoming truly unmanageable.”  In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December 19, 2007 NPA modification 
letter.   

101 
scheduled January 4, 2008 plea hearing.  As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve 
an expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by  
January 4, 2008, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled.  On January 2, 2008, Sloman 
spoke with Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing 
had been postponed.  In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafaña, Sloman said that Epstein’s 
local defense attorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts 
“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that 
assessment.159  The next day, Villafaña sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article 
reporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal 
authorities would drop their investigation of him.  Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafaña an 
email memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkowitz in a phone call that day:  “‘I 
[Lefkowitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.  [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not 
registrable.  It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”160 
5. 
January 7, 2008:  Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes 
Additional Allegations of USAO Misconduct 
On January 7, 2008, Acosta and Sloman met with defense attorney Sanchez at her request.  
According to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the 
USAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national 
news reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC 
by agreeing to a watered-down resolution for Epstein.”  After Acosta excused himself to attend 
another meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,” 
she left.  Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkowitz, and Sanchez, 
who expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA, 
and pressed for the “watered-down resolution,” which they specified would mean allowing Epstein 
to plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register 
as a sexual offender.  A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwritten notes of the conversation 
reads:  “We’re back to where we started in September.”   
That evening, Villafaña expressed concern that the delay in resolving the matter was 
affecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his 
agreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein 
was pursuing Departmental review.  Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims, 
interviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact 
with “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to 
obtain Epstein’s computers. 
In the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts” 
review of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence 
Villafaña had compiled.  He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined 
159  
Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth 
facts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.   
160  
Although the meeting Lefkowitz had with Lourie, Villafaña, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state 
resolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkowitz’s reference was likely to the September 12, 2007 meeting.   

102 
that it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go 
forward with” the charges.  He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we 
did not have . . . a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not 
be favorable for us.”  Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he 
told Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.   
6. 
Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence 
Notwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkowitz 
that they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that 
the Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the 
defense.”  They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that 
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan would designate an attorney having “a national perspective” to conduct 
a fresh review in light of the defense submissions.  Oosterbaan assigned a CEOS Trial Attorney 
who Villafaña understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not 
“consummate” the NPA.  The CEOS Trial Attorney traveled to Florida to review the case 
materials, and to meet with Villafaña to discuss the case and interview some of the victims.  After 
one such meeting, Villafaña wrote to Acosta and Sloman: 
We just finished interviewing three of the girls.  I wish you could 
have been there to see how much this has affected them. 
One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview 
twice within a 20 minute span.  She regained her composure enough 
to continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares 
about Epstein coming after her and she started to break down again, 
so we stopped the interview. 
The second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the 18 
month deal she had read about in the paper.  She said that 18 months 
was nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get 
restitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein 
spend a significant time in jail. 
. . . . 
These girls deserve so much better than they have received so far, 
and I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.161 
The CEOS Trial Attorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.  
She told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges 
for a prosecution:  some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein; 
some had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged 
as accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been 
“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.  She did not regard 
161  
Villafaña added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrow.  Can I persuade you to attend?”  

103 
these victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Attorney 
considered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.”  In addition, she told OPR that 
there were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these 
difficulties could be overcome.  Shortly after the CEOS Trial Attorney met with the victims, 
however, “things just stopped” when Oosterbaan instructed her to cease her involvement in the 
case and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.   
IX. 
FEBRUARY – JUNE 2008:  THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW 
Epstein’s defense attorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would 
encompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the 
various allegations of professional misconduct by USAO attorneys and other personnel.  The 
Department, however, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA 
or any specific provisions.162  Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense 
appealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the 
Deputy Attorney General.  The chart set forth on the following page shows the positions and 
relationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO 
or defense beginning in November 2007 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through 
June 2008. 
162  
On February 28, 2008, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division written 
notification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation matter” involving Epstein and others “that 
may result in charges of violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.”  USAM § 8-3.120 required a U.S. Attorney to notify the 
Civil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal 
civil rights statutes, . . . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses 
before a grand jury.”  The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.  
The written notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the 
statutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Attorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the 
case was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Attorney’s proposed staffing of the matter.   
Villafaña became aware of this requirement in late February 2008, and she prepared a written notification 
that was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta.  After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:  
The Office anticipates charges of violations of Title 18, United States Code, 
Sections 371, 2422, 2423, and 1591.  The investigation of the case by the City of 
Palm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the 
titillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child 
prostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a matter of “national interest” 
as defined by the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. 
In the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the matter,” he 
anticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should 
be [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.”  OPR did not locate a response from the 
Civil Rights Division to the notification.

February - May 15, 2008: Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division 
On Febrnaiy 21, 2008, soon after the CEOS Trial Attorney met with victims, Oosterbaan 
spoke with Lefkowitz about CEOS's role. fu a subsequent email to Villafana, Sloman, and Senior, 
Oosterbaan explained: 
I told [Lefkowitz] that all I want to do is help the process move 
fo1ward, and if they think we best help the process by taking a fresh 
and objective look at the case and their arguments [then] that is what 
I want to do. I told him that if that's what they want - if that is what 
will help the process to move fo1ward - then I don't think it's 
advisable for CEOS to partner with the USAO on the case. He wants 
to think about that (and probably talk to his co-counsel about 
104 

105 
whether it is better to have us partnered in the case or just serve a 
review function) and he said he’d get back to me later today. 
Oosterbaan told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to 
limit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with 
that,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.  
Oosterbaan explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new 
problems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with 
it, tell us now.”   
By February 25, 2008, Lefkowitz told Oosterbaan, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS 
role should be “review only.”  Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice, 
and Oosterbaan continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Attorney General 
Mandelker, informed of the defense team contacts.  Sloman emailed Lefkowitz that CEOS was 
“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the matter.  Sloman advised Lefkowitz that “in 
the event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein, 
this Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s 
position, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].”  Sloman forwarded this email 
to Villafaña, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has 
put us through?  And after we have discovered 6 new girls . . . .” 
The defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the 
Department’s involvement.  On February 29, 2008, Lefkowitz requested a defense meeting with 
Oosterbaan on March 12, 2008.163  Starr spoke to Assistant Attorney General Fisher and “made it 
clear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the 
prosecution.”  On March 6, 2008, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterbaan that Starr and Lefkowitz 
had called him to express “concern” about Oosterbaan’s participation in the case, and indicated 
that “they may ask for more senior involvement.”  Acosta “informed them that they certainly had 
the right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever 
process would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”  
The next day, Lefkowitz followed up with Acosta in an email: 
We appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice 
determines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this matter.  
As you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with 
Drew Oosterbaan, and engage in a discussion with him about all of 
the facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues 
associated with this case. . . .  However, due to our misgivings 
(engendered because Drew has told us that he sees himself as a 
prosecutor and has already made clear he would be ready and willing 
to prosecute this case himself[)] we may well find it necessary to 
163  
The defense team meeting with CEOS was originally to be set for late January, but never got scheduled for 
that time.  On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkowitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays” 
in the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS 
time to engage in a thorough review.”   

106 
appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.  Ken [Starr] 
and I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to 
our seeking appellate review within DOJ. 
Starr, Lefkowitz, and Martin Weinberg attended the March 12, 2008 meeting, as well as 
the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.  
Oosterbaan, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department.  The 
current CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing 
most of the presentation.  Oosterbaan told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the 
defense team was saying “some outrageous things.”  Both Oosterbaan and his Deputy Chief were 
disturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for 
child exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the 
CEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not 
effective. 
After the meeting, Starr and Lefkowitz made multiple written submissions to the Criminal 
Division.  One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious 
concern,” including the following: 
“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any 
communication with state authorities”;164  
the issuance of legal process and document requests for items that 
“had no connection to the conduct at issue”; 
the nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the 
Assistant United States Attorneys involved in this case” to serve as 
the victims’ attorney representative; 
the “insistence” on a victim notification letter inviting the victims to 
make sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and 
the purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a 
law firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits 
against Epstein.165 
164  
This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafaña’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO 
communications with the state authorities.  In November 2007, Sloman noted to Lefkowitz, “Your recent 
correspondence attempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Attorney’s Office . . . raises 
concern.”  In a March 2008 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafaña noted that she did not know 
whether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact 
with the State Attorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Attorney] in over 6 months.”  Villafaña 
later reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating 
with him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”   
165  
In approximately 2001, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a 
Miami attorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.  During 2007-2008, the attorney 

107 
In another letter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed 
information about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafaña of “encouraging civil 
litigation” against Epstein.  Finally, in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Fisher on  
May 14, 2008, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the 
defense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkowitz, and Whitley.    
Meanwhile, Oosterbaan’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision letter to be sent from Oosterbaan 
to Lefkowitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, as well as 
the Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of 
Enforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy).  Oosterbaan told OPR that, notwithstanding 
the defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited 
to determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.    
Oosterbaan’s letter, sent to Lefkowitz on May 15, 2008, notified the defense team that 
CEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal 
criminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.”  The letter specified 
that CEOS’s review addressed the “narrow question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a 
federal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues 
relating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA 
or the prosecutorial misconduct allegations.  The letter stated that based on its examination of the 
material relevant to its limited review of the matter, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution 
in this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his 
discretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”    
On May 19, 2008, Lefkowitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically 
asked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”  Lefkowitz made several points in support 
of the request for a meeting:  (1) CEOS’s letter acknowledged that federal prosecution of Epstein 
would involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;166 (2) CEOS’s conclusion that 
federal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the 
case;167 (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical 
new evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that 
represented Epstein victims.  The Epstein defense team alleged in the letter that Sloman’s past association with the 
attorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.  
166  
Oosterbaan’s letter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution 
even though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.”  This statement referred to a defense argument 
based on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult 
prostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.”  Oosterbaan stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly 
focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults 
through force, fraud, or coercion.”  He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look 
precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”    
167  
Oosterbaan began his letter, however, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrow question as 
to whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Attorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of 
Mr. Epstein.”  

108 
federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”168  Lefkowitz alluded to the possibility of 
seeking further review of the matter by the Deputy Attorney General or Attorney General, should 
the defense be unable to “resolve this matter directly with” Acosta.   
Acosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkowitz to communicate 
with the “trial team.”  That same day, Sloman sent Lefkowitz a letter asking that all further 
communication about the case be made to Villafaña or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating 
that Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls.  Sloman noted that the USAO 
had “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but 
“these objections have finally been exhausted.”  Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate 
the NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on  
June 2, 2008.   
B. 
May – June 23, 2008:  Review by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
Also on May 19, 2008, Starr and Whitley co-authored a letter to Deputy Attorney General 
Mark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state matter.”169  In 
the letter, they acknowledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the 
Epstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of 
the Justice Department.”  They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and 
that “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond 
any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.”  They followed up 
with a second letter on May 27, 2008, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the 
enforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented 
extension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton” 
required Departmental review.  On this latter point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public 
arena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that 
there was “little doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case 
if Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’”  This was the first defense submission mentioning 
Epstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement 
in the investigation was due to politics. 
In the May 27, 2008 letter to the Deputy Attorney General, Starr and Whitley used the 
existing June 2, 2008 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need 
for review of the case “all the more exigent.”  John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Attorney 
General who was handling the matter, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on  
May 28, 2008, Sloman notified Lefkowitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending 
completion of the review by the Deputy Attorney General’s office.170  Meanwhile, the Criminal 
168  
Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220, defendants are permitted to depose victims, and Epstein’s 
counsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims, 
including victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation. 
169  
In addition to having served as U.S. Attorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting 
Associate Attorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.  
170  
On May 28, 2008, Attorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO 
with Acosta and other senior managers.  OPR found no indication that the Epstein matter was discussed.   

109 
Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous 
amount of material” regarding the Epstein matter.  On June 3, 2008, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy 
letter from Sloman to the Deputy Attorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations 
with Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional 
misconduct.  Among the documents submitted with the letter were the prosecution memorandum, 
one of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s 
December 19, 2007 letter to Sanchez. 
As the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, State Attorney 
Krischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local 
defense attorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve 
a 90-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information.  Upon learning of this, Villafaña 
wrote to her immediate supervisor:  “Please tell me that you are joking.  Maybe we should throw 
him [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.”  Villafaña and her immediate 
supervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to 
insist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the 
agreement and proceed accordingly.”171  
Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving 
Starr’s letter.  Following the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s letter was handled by John Roth, 
an experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the 
USAO.  Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein.  Roth explained to OPR 
that he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s 
counsel, and instead limited his review to written materials submitted by Epstein’s attorneys and 
by Sloman to the Deputy Attorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and 
the USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that 
CEOS furnished to him.  Roth discussed the matter with two senior staff colleagues, as well as 
with the Deputy Attorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.   
Roth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and 
because he believed the NPA was a “dead letter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or 
ratify it post hoc.  On the other hand, Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR he understood that 
the NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis 
for the agreement.  Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, however, Deputy 
Attorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether 
the NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment.  He told OPR, “[W]e 
heard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief.  We didn’t give him a meeting 
and we didn’t give him [any] relief.”  Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his 
office who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.”  In particular, he 
told OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was 
“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated 
“just seemed unserious.”   
171  
Villafaña urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.” 

110 
On Monday, June 23, 2008, Roth sent a brief letter to Starr and Lefkowitz informing them 
that the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein matter 
and did not believe intervention by the Deputy Attorney General was warranted in view of the 
“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Attorneys.  He added, “Even if we 
were to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution 
of this case is appropriate.”   
Immediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s letter, Villafaña notified defense counsel that 
Epstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the NPA 
by entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence.  On 
June 26, 2008, Roth alerted the Office of the Attorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to 
contact the Attorney General to request additional review and urged the Attorney General not to 
take defense counsel’s calls.  Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try 
to take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.   
Meanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknowledging they had reached “the 
end of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe 
is the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize 
that we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. . . .  I would like to have . . . some 
closure with you on this matter so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will 
over the matter.” 
X. 
JUNE 2008 – JUNE 2009:  EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS 
CUSTODIAL SENTENCE 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, Villafaña renewed her requests to Epstein’s local attorneys 
Goldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Attorney’s 
Office, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA.  After receiving 
and reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafaña sent another letter to 
Goldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with 
the requirements of the NPA.  Specifically, as written, the plea agreement called for a sentence of 
months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” followed consecutively by “18 months 
Community Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of 
community control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.”  Villafaña objected to the 
community control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to 
“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement 
twenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.”  In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafaña recounted 
that she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in 
custody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.”  Villafaña 
added that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade 
. . . . Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Attorney] months ago that 
Epstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”172  
Villafaña told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”   
172  
The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum 
custody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.  See 

111 
The next day, Villafaña asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the 
word “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so.  Villafaña, however, did not 
ask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County 
Detention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade.  The final signed plea agreement form 
further clarified the sentence, providing that after serving 12 months in the Palm Beach County 
Detention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention 
Facility . . . to be served consecutive to the 12 month sentence,” followed by “12 months 
Community Control.”  The word “imprisoned” was hand written after “6 months” but then crossed 
out and replaced by “jail sentence.”173   
A. 
June 30, 2008:  Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court 
Epstein, with his attorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on  
June 30, 2008, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of 
solicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of 
procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.174  At the plea hearing, which Villafaña and the 
FBI case agent attended as spectators, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts 
of the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal 
information: 
[B]etween August 1, 2004 and October 31, 2005, the defendant in 
Palm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit 
[prostitution] on three or more occasions.  And . . . between  
August 1, 2004 and October 9, 2005, the defendant did procure a 
minor under the age of 18 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach 
County also.175 
The court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in 
a colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims: 
The Court:   
Are there more than one victim? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
There’s several. 
. . . . 
http://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.  The “Stockade” was a “lower security ‘camp-style’ facility” 
co-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  Both were administered by the Sheriff’s Office. 
173  
Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 30, 2008, and filed in court.  Villafaña complained to Goldberger when 
she learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”  
174  
The Information is attached as Exhibit 5. 
175  
State v. Epstein, case nos. 06-CF-9454 and 08-CF-9381, Transcript of Plea Conference at 41-42 (Fifteenth 
Judicial Circuit, June 30, 2008) (Plea Hearing Transcript).  Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language 
of the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.   

112 
The Court:   
Are all the victims in both these cases in 
agreement with the terms of the plea? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
I have spoken to several myself and I have 
spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the 
other victim, and I believe, yes. 
The Court:   
And with regard to the victims under age 
eighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian 
in agreement with the plea? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
That victim is not under age 18 any more and 
that’s why we spoke with her counsel. 
The Court:   
And she is in agreement with the plea? 
Ms. Belohlavek:   
Yes.176 
When the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations 
by any civil attorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present, 
spoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution 
agreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.   
After the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to 
the plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.   
In the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed 
positive reactions to the outcome, and Villafaña received several congratulatory messages.  
Oosterbaan wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last!  Your work on this matter was truly 
exceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.”  One senior 
colleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad 
guy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.”  Another wrote, “If it had not 
been for you, he would have gotten away with it.”   The CEOS Trial Attorney who had worked 
briefly with Villafaña told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s 
life.”  One victim’s attorney stated, “[G]reat job of not letting this guy off.”  But Villafaña was not 
satisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I 
don’t feel like celebrating 18 months.  He should be spending 18 years in jail.”   
Acosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer 
congratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black, 
176  
Plea Hearing Transcript at 20, 42.  OPR was unable to determine to which victims Belohlavek was referring, 
and Belohlovek did not recall during her OPR interview, but it is possible that she was referring only to the victims of 
the charged crimes rather than to all of the victims identified in either the state or federal investigations.  Belohlavek 
told OPR that because of the nature of the charges (that is, involving prostitution), she did not know whether 
“technically under the law” the girls were “victims” whom she was required to notify of the plea hearing.   

113 
Dershowitz, Lefkowitz and Starr.”177  In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he 
received communications from Dershowitz, Starr, and Lefkowitz, who “all sought to make peace” 
with him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”   
On July 7, 2008, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in 
federal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined 
the petition soon thereafter.  The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in 
Chapter Three of this Report.   
B. 
Epstein Is Placed on Work Release 
A few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafaña reported to Sloman that Epstein was 
incarcerated at the low-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county 
prisoners were usually housed.  She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein 
was eligible for work release.  Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be 
incarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed 
explicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue.  Epstein’s 
acceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as 
another special benefit given to Epstein.  Because the decision to allow Epstein into the work 
release program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether 
any state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated.  OPR did examine the USAO’s 
consideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to 
ensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.     
The first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed, 
when Lefkowitz asserted, in his October 23, 2007 letter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s 
sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence 
available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”   
In November 2007, Sloman had an exchange of letters with Lefkowitz about the USAO’s 
understanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,” 
pointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.”  Sloman noted 
that Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allow individuals registered as sexual 
offenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release 
program.  Sloman concluded that the USAO “is putting you on notice that it intends to make certain 
that Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no better and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same 
offense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the 
reasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”178   
However, also in November, State Attorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact, 
eligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place

Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The Daily 
Beast.  The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknowledged that 
it could have occurred.   
178  
Sloman provided a draft of this letter to Acosta for his approval before the letter was sent to Lefkowitz.   

114 
until after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is 
in the agreement.”179  On November 16, 2007, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if 
the State Attorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.  
Belohlavek was noncommittal, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s 
plea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she 
would have to discuss the issue with the State Attorney.180  Krischer later told OPR that work 
release was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.”  The state’s plea agreement 
with Epstein did not address the issue of work release.   
The day after Epstein entered his June 30, 2008 plea, Villafaña and her immediate 
supervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release.  According to 
Villafaña, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on 
work release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a 
jail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense attorney Jack 
Goldberger to Villafaña just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told 
[Villafaña] that [Epstein] would not get work release.”  Villafaña alerted the Sheriff’s Office 
official that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every 
day” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist 
until November 2007.181  Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida 
Science Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger.  Villafaña and her 
supervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.   
Acosta told OPR that he was aware Villafaña was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get 
work release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts.  Acosta explained that the USAO 
expected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shown by “our subsequent 
communications with the [S]tate [A]ttorney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not 
what our office envisioned.”   
In August 2008, Villafaña spoke with defense attorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s 
compliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release.  Villafaña later reported to Acosta 
and Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . 18 months IN JAIL is a 
material term of the agreement.” 
The USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application.  On October 10, 
2008, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach 
Sheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permitting him to leave the Stockade 
179  
According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex 
offender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”  
180  
In the November 16, 2007 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafaña also indicated that she was 
“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work 
release.  In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafaña that they had also spoken with a “jail 
supervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the 
judge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.   
181  
During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had 
been in existence for 15 years, and he worked there “every day.”   Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.  

115 
for up to 12 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office 
in West Palm Beach.182  In mid-November 2008, Villafaña learned that Epstein was on work 
release.  She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development 
in an email, and asked, “Can I indict him now?”   
On November 24, 2008, Villafaña sent defense attorney Black a letter, notifying him that 
the USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program 
constituted a material breach of the NPA.  Villafaña reminded Black that she had “more than a 
dozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for 18 months, 
and that her June 27, 2008 letter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-
four hours a day.”  Villafaña noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into 
the plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.”  Villafaña 
told counsel: 
The [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based 
upon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e., 
confinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the 
federal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.  Accordingly, the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated 
the [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day 
for the eighteen-month term of imprisonment.  The United States 
will exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless 
Mr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this 
agreement. 
According to Villafaña, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release 
coordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to 
believe the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened 
with legal action if he did not allow Epstein to participate in work release.    
On November 26, 2008, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from 
all matters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the 
Epstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.183  As a 
result, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to 
Epstein.   
Also on November 26, 2008, Black responded to Villafaña’s letter, acknowledging that 
Epstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying 
that Epstein was in breach of the NPA.184  Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release; 
the NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate; 
182  
Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm 
Beach Daily News, Dec. 13, 2008.   
183  
The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2008.   
184  
Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafaña “is very concerned about anything Epstein does” 
and that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.   

116 
Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s 
Office had discretion to grant work release to any inmate.  Black also claimed that Acosta 
“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release 
Program” and pointed out that the December 6, 2007 draft victim notification letter sent to 
Lefkowitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is 
allowed to participate in a work release program.”   
On December 3, 2008, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafaña sent 
Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work 
release program: 
It appears that, since Day 1, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have 
been scheming to get Epstein out on work release.  For example, the 
indictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would 
have made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged 
correctly.  (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with letting 
us believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when 
Epstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was 
not registrable.)  Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that 
Epstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the 
Stockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at 
the jail. . . .   
As part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff’s 
deputies to provide him with “protection.”  It appears that he is 
paying between $3000 and $4100 per week for this service, despite 
the work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and 
the Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions 
with inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the 
Sheriff . . . .” 
Villafaña added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge 
on the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement.  Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafaña also 
pointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed 
about the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon 
Epstein’s release.”   
On December 11, 2008, Villafaña wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach 
County Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release 
and to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several 
inaccuracies and omitted relevant information.  Villafaña pointed out that Epstein’s application 
identified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number 
listed in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law 
firm of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger.  Villafaña also noted that the individual identified in 
the work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submitted 
publicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked 
only one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to 

117 
the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for 12 hours per 
day.  Finally, Villafaña pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor”—who as the 
Foundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had 
promised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the 
“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor 
Epstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis.  The Sheriff’s Office neither acknowledged nor 
responded to Villafaña’s letter. 
In March 2009, Sloman met in Miami with Dershowitz for, as Dershowitz characterized it 
in a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the 
Epstein case.  After that encounter, Dershowitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for 
Sloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with how the Palm Beach sheriff administers” 
Epstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.”  Sloman responded: 
Regarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Attorney’s Office will not 
interfere with how the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the 
sentence imposed by the Court.  That being said, this does not mean 
that the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the 
terms and conditions of his sentence.  Furthermore, it does not mean 
that, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or 
in-home detention, we would not object.  To be clear, if contacted 
we will object.  Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of 
Mr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent 
to PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or 
home detention. 
A week later, Dershowitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for 
Sloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position 
on how he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but 
adding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”    
Epstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a 12-month period 
following his release from prison.  On July 22, 2009, almost 13 months after he began serving his 
sentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.185  At this 
time, he registered as a sexual offender.  
XI. 
POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS 
In the summer of 2009, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear 
Stearns, and that he had been released early from his 18-month imprisonment term because of that 
185  
In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision 
program.  Florida Statute § 948.001(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the 
community.” 

118 
cooperation.186  When Villafaña spoke with attorneys in the Eastern District of New York, 
however, an AUSA there told Villafaña that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not 
cooperated with the Bear Stearns case.187  During her OPR interview, Villafaña told OPR that to 
her knowledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”   
Villafaña and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the 
NPA.  In August 2009, Villafaña alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of 
his home detention—he had been spotted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police, 
he claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.  Villafaña 
passed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.188  By letter dated 
September 1, 2009, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision 
of the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein 
maintained his “primary residence.”  In response, Villafaña notified Black that the USAO opposed 
such a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA.  Three months later, Sloman met with 
Dershowitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of 
Epstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s 
supervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.   
After serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on 
July 21, 2010. 
186  
See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2009. 
187  
The New York AUSA had emailed Villafaña, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] . . . .  We 
saw the below article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never 
heard of until this morning.  We’ve since learned that he is pretty unsavory.”  Villafaña reported to Sloman and other 
supervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of] 
New York.  They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a low sentence because he was 
cooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution.  They had never heard of him.”  In a second email, she 
confirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”   
188  
Black later wrote a letter to Villafaña claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the 
distance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the matter was “fully investigated,” 
Epstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.

CHAPTER TWO 
PART TWO:  APPLICABLE STANDARDS 
I. 
OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK  
OPR finds professional misconduct when an attorney intentionally violates or acts in 
reckless disregard of a known, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional 
conduct, or Department regulation or policy.  In determining whether an attorney has engaged in 
professional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual 
findings. 
An attorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the attorney (1) engages 
in conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously 
prohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knowing its natural or probable consequence, and that 
consequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits.  An attorney acts 
in reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (1) the attorney knows or should know, 
based on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an 
obligation or standard; (2) the attorney knows or should know, based on his or her experience and 
the unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the attorney’s conduct involves a 
substantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard; 
and (3) the attorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under 
all the circumstances.  Thus, an attorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents 
a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable attorney would 
observe in the same situation.  
If OPR determines that an attorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR 
determines whether the attorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct, 
made a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances.  An attorney exercises poor 
judgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that 
is in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an attorney 
exercising good judgment to take.  Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an 
attorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not 
have violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard.  In addition, an 
attorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not 
sufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding.  A mistake, on 
the other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an attorney’s exercise of reasonable 
care under the circumstances.  
An attorney who makes a good faith attempt to ascertain the obligations and standards 
imposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional 
misconduct.  Evidence that an attorney made a good faith attempt to ascertain and comply with 
the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the attorney 
reviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and 
standards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the attorney 
representing a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took 

120 
affirmative steps the attorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or 
standard. 
II. 
APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 
A. 
The United States Attorneys’ Manual  
Among its many provisions, the United States Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes 
general statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and 
desirable practices to be followed, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial 
responsibilities.189  The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial 
authority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and 
to promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and 
objectively on the merits of each case.”  USAM § 9-27.001.  
Because the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of 
government attorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing 
guidance rather than mandating results.  Id.; see also USAM § 9-27.120, comment (“It is expected 
that each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law 
enforcement responsibilities . . . . However, it is not intended that reference to these principles will 
require a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.110, comment 
(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when, 
whom, how, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).  
However, USAM § 9-27.130 provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal 
prosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline.  In particular, USAM 
§ 9-27.130 states that each U.S. Attorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that 
prosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with 
the principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles 
set forth in the USAM are followed by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary 
sanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate. 
U.S. Attorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal matters” and may 
modify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of 
fair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.  USAM §§ 9-2.001, 
9.27-140.  The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource 
Manual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal 
prosecutions. 
1. 
USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a 
Federal Prosecution  
Federal prosecutors do not open a case on every matter referred to them.  USAM § 9-2.020 
explicitly authorizes a U.S. Attorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to 
189  
In 2018, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.  In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR 
relies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.  Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, 
citations in this Report are to the 1997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2007. 

121 
him/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.”  Whenever a U.S. Attorney closes a 
case without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it.  USAM 
§ 9-27.220 sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence 
or decline federal prosecution.  A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution 
if he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a 
conviction of a federal offense, unless (1) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the 
person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate 
alternative to prosecution.  A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to 
determine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor 
“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.230, 9-27.240, or 9-27.250, as appropriate. 
USAM § 9-27.230 sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal 
prosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by 
initiating prosecution against a person: 
1. 
Federal law enforcement priorities;190 
2. 
The nature and seriousness of the offense;191 
3. 
The deterrent effect of prosecution; 
4. 
The person’s culpability in connection with the offense; 
5. 
The person’s history with respect to criminal activity; 
6. 
The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation 
or prosecution of others; and 
7. 
The probable sentence or other consequences if the person 
is convicted. 
The USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case 
in deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred.  USAM § 9-27.240 directs 
that in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor 
should weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s 
interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and 
the probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other 
jurisdiction.  A comment to this provision explains: 
190  
A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal 
prosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities. 
191  
A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must 
also include consideration of the impact on the victim.  The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue, 
“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution 
merely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.” 

122 
Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of 
particularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local 
jurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the 
offense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the 
investigation was conducted primarily by state or local 
investigators, or some other circumstance.  Whatever the reason, 
when it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less 
substantial than the interest of state or local authorities, 
consideration should be given to referring the case to those 
authorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal 
prosecution. 
Another comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the 
Federal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, attitudes, relationships or other 
circumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a 
thorough and successful prosecution.” 
USAM § 9-27.260 identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether 
to initiate or decline a federal prosecution.  Specifically, the decision may not be based on 
consideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities, 
or beliefs; the prosecutor’s “own personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible 
effect of the decision on the prosecutor’s own professional or personal circumstances.  When 
opting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision 
are communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files.  USAM § 9-27.270. 
2. 
USAM § 9-2.031:  The Petite Policy 
Although the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and 
federal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the 
Department has a long-standing policy, known as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions 
charged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar 
conduct.192  The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set 
forth in USAM § 9-2.031, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which 
contains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring 
a federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or 
federal proceeding.  The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal 
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, 
or a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”   
In circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new 
federal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.  The prerequisites are as follows: 
(1)  
The matter must involve a substantial federal interest.  The determination whether 
a substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis.  Matters 
192  
See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (1977); Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529 (1960).  

123 
that come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established 
by the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other matters. 
(2) 
The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably 
unvindicated.”  In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has 
vindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain 
circumstances.  As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the 
choice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as 
incompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence.  The presumption may 
be overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior 
sentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a 
substantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as 
imprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal 
prosecution.” 
(3) 
The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal
offense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and
sustain a conviction. 
However, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a 
federal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed 
prosecution. 
The Petite policy cautions that whenever a matter involves overlapping federal and state 
jurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most 
appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests 
involved.”  If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular 
prosecution, the prosecutor should submit the matter to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General 
for resolution.  Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General must be obtained 
before bringing a prosecution governed by this policy. 
3. 
USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements 
Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a 
plea agreement.  USAM §§ 9-27.330; 9-27.400.  Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned 
by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).193  Regardless of whether the plea agreement is 
offered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the 
totality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.”  USAM § 9-27.400, comment.194  The 
importance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM 
§ 9-27.430, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that 
represents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the 
193  
As previously noted, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a 
specific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.   
194  
See also USAM § 9-27.300 (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the attorney for the government 
should charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is 
likely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).  

124 
defendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an 
appropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or 
prosecution of others.  USAM § 9-27.420 specifies:  
In determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea 
agreement, the attorney for the government should weigh all 
relevant considerations, including: 
1. 
The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the 
investigation or prosecution of others; 
2. 
The defendant’s history with respect to criminal 
activity; 
3. 
The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses 
charged; 
4. 
The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her 
willingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct; 
5. 
The desirability of prompt and certain disposition of 
the case; 
6. 
The likelihood of obtaining a conviction at trial; 
7. 
The probable effect on witnesses; 
8. 
The probable sentence or other consequences if the 
defendant is convicted; 
9. 
The public interest in having the case tried rather 
than disposed of by a guilty plea; 
10. 
The expense of trial and appeal; 
11. 
The need to avoid delay in the disposition of other 
pending cases; and 
12. 
The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution. 
4. 
USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements 
USAM § 9-27.600 authorizes government attorneys to enter into a non-prosecution 
agreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation.  The provision explains that a non-prosecution 
agreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely 
cooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired 
cooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.”  A comment to this provision explains that 
such “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for 

125 
cooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.  
The comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permitting an 
offender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in 
the first instance.”  USAM §§ 9-27.620 and 9-27.630 set forth considerations a prosecutor should 
take into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement.  Generally, the U.S. Attorney 
has authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement.  USAM § 9-27.600 comment.  However, 
USAM § 9-27.640 directs that a government attorney should not enter into a non-prosecution 
agreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the 
appropriate Assistant Attorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who 
“is likely to become of major public interest.”   
These USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in 
circumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation. 
5. 
USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity 
Nothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure 
of third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant.  Instead, the provision that addresses 
immunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has 
asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  See USAM §§ 9-23.100 et seq.   
6. 
USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest 
Department employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related 
laws, rules, regulations, and policies.  See, generally, USAM § 1-4.000 et seq.  Specifically, a 
government attorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and 
substantially in any particular matter in which he has a financial interest or in which such an 
interest can be imputed to him.  See 18 U.S.C. § 208 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.401-402.  In addition, 
a Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any 
matter in which his impartiality could be questioned.  If a conflict of interest exists, in order for 
the employee to participate in the matter, the head of the employee’s component, with the 
concurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in 
the employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the 
integrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in 
writing.  See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.501-502. 
B. 
Other Department Policies 
1. 
Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges 
The Attorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the 
Department.  Over the span of several decades, each successive Attorney General has articulated 
those priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors.  As applicable here, on 
September 22, 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding 
“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and 
Sentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).  The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous 
Departmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal 

126 
prosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the 
Sentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing 
practices.”195 
The Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge 
and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of 
the case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or designated 
supervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances.  The Ashcroft Memo cautioned 
that a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either 
the law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.  The Ashcroft 
Memo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all 
charges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence 
under the Sentencing Guidelines.   
The policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor 
to decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the written 
or otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or “designated 
supervisory attorney.”  As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be 
appropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Attorney’s Office is 
“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and 
proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.  
The Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea 
agreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo. 
On January 28, 2005, Deputy Attorney General James Comey issued a memorandum 
entitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.”  That memorandum 
reiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily 
provable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial 
sentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any 
statutorily required consecutive sentence. 
Importantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line 
prosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is 
placed upon the U.S. Attorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.  In 
addition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allowing a prosecutor 
195  
The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 
(2005), which struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose 
a sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range.  Those Guidelines were the product of 
the United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.  The 
Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003, Pub. 
L. 108–21, 117 Stat. 650, was directed at preventing child abuse.  It included a variety of provisions designed to 
improve the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.  Among other things, the PROTECT Act 
provided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple 
occasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified 
numbers of images. 

127 
flexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or 
evidence supports the charge. 
2. 
Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens 
On April 28, 1995, the Attorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors 
entitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly 
become involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States.  In pertinent 
part, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious 
deportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with 
alien defendants.  These tools include (1) stipulated administrative deportation orders in 
connection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under 
U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252a(d).  The 
memorandum further directs: 
All deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless 
extraordinary circumstances exist.  Accordingly, absent such 
circumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of 
deportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most 
appropriate in a particular case.  Exceptions to this policy must have 
the written approval of the United States Attorney.  
See also USAM § 9-73.520.  A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a 
crime.196 
Stipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense 
to which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in 
U.S.C. § 1251 as an offense that causes an alien to be deported.  Under 8 U.S.C. 
§ 1251(a)(2)(A)(i), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years 
after the date of entry (or 10 years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident 
status), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is 
deportable.   
C. 
Case Law 
1. 
Prosecutorial Discretion 
On many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s 
discretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute.  In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357 
(1978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek 
more serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense 
originally charged.  The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and 
196  
According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have 
been convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border 
Patrol.”  See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics, 
Criminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2020, available at https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-
statistics/criminal-alien-statistics. 

128 
the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges.  Hayes was thereafter convicted and 
sentenced under the new indictment.  The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his 
conviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a 
legitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process.  Hayes filed for review of his 
conviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted 
impermissible vindictive prosecution. 
The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling.  The Court opined that “acceptance 
of the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty 
plea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining 
process.”  Id. at 363.  A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been 
committed, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a 
grand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.”  Id. at 364 (emphasis added).  The Court explained that 
selectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable 
standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.  Id. 
These principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), a case 
involving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves 
as having failed to register with the Selective Service system.  The petitioner in Wayte claimed 
that the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were 
being punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.  The Supreme Court rejected this 
argument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and 
that the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an 
unjustifiable standard.  Id. at 607-08.  Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to 
have a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.   
In Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state 
prosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation 
of the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others 
had unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him.  The Court held that “in initiating a 
prosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the 
judicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit 
for damages.  Id. at 430-31.  In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (1st Cir. 1992), the court applied 
Imbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute.  The court noted that “given the 
availability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that 
symmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.”  Id. at 41 (emphasis in 
original).   
Finally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), the 
Supreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not 
reviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 500-706.  
2. 
Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency towards a Third Party 
Case law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party 
arises in two contexts.  First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea 

129 
when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations.  Numerous courts have 
made clear, however, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a 
promise of leniency towards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third 
party if a plea is not entered.  See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 909 F.2d 738, 741-42 (2d Cir. 
1990) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by 
the government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he 
pled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1244, 1248 (11th Cir. 1985) (in order to satisfy “heavy 
burden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging 
voluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against 
the defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe 
the defendant’s wife had committed a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v. 
State, 839 So. 2d 906, 909 (Fla. App. 2003) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a 
third party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge 
the third party.”). 
The second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’ 
promises of leniency to third parties.  For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App. 
1997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in 
open court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew, 
who had all been charged as a result of the same incident.  When the state reneged and attempted 
to prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state 
appealed.  The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law 
principles, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were 
therefore entitled to enforce it.   
Apart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a 
prosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of 
prosecutorial discretion.    
D. 
State Bar Rules 
During the period relevant to this Report, the five subject attorneys were members of the 
bar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in 
which they held membership.197  In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of 
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law 
provisions of each applicable bar.  Local Rule 11.1(f) incorporates rules governing the admission, 
practice, peer review, and discipline of attorneys (Attorney Admission Rules).198  Attorney 
Admission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Attorney or AUSA employed full-time by the 
government may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United 
States in the attorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.  Any attorney so appearing 
197  
The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.   
198  
These rules have been in effect since December 1994. 

130 
is subject to all rules of the court.199  Attorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that 
attorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct 
(FRPC).  Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of 
professional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.   
1. 
FRPC 4-1.1 – Competence 
FRPC 4-1.1 requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.200  
Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation 
reasonably necessary for the representation.  A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors 
relevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular matter include “the relative 
complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s 
training and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give 
the matter, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer 
of established competence in the field.”  The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the 
required proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular matters, 
competence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.  
The comment to Rule 4-1.1 explains that “[t]he required attention and preparation are determined 
in part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more 
extensive treatment than matters of lesser complexity and consequence.” 
2. 
FRPC 4-1.3 – Diligence 
FRPC 4-1.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in 
representing a client.  A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf 
of a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take 
whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.”  A 
lawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every 
advantage that might be realized for a client.” 
3. 
FRPC 4-4.1 – Candor in Dealing with Others 
FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact 
or law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.  A comment to this rule 
explains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or 
omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular 
statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.” 
199  
See also 28 U.S.C. § 530B(a), providing that government attorneys are subject to state laws and state and 
local federal court rules governing attorneys in each state where the government attorney engages in his duties. 
200  
The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United 
States.  See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Attorney); 28 C.F.R. § 0.5(b) (the Attorney General represents 
the United States in legal matters). 

131 
4. 
FRPC 4-8.4 – Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice 
FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit, or misrepresentation.   
FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice 
of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.   
In Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2000), the court noted that FRPC 
4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to 
“conduct in connection with the practice of law.”  In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 41 So. 3d 166, 172 
(Fla. 2010), for example, an attorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s 
matter resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due 
to the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.201 
201  
OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor.  Nothing in the text of that rule, 
however, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report.  A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has 
adopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.  
These “standards,” however, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors.  Indeed, the 
ABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional 
discipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for 
civil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.”  OPR does not consider 
the ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.

CHAPTER TWO 
PART THREE:  ANALYSIS 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
Following the Miami Herald report in November 2018, media scrutiny of and public 
attention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated.  At the heart 
of the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s 18-month sentence, which resulted in a 13-
month term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal 
conduct.  Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from 
Epstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making 
process leading to the signed NPA.  As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s 
motivations for entering into the NPA.  Publicly released communications between prosecutors 
and defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the 
NPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because 
they were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships 
with his attorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.    
Through its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the following core questions:  (1) who 
was responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its 
specific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules 
or regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by 
improper factors, such as corruption or favoritism.  To the extent that available records and witness 
interviews shed light on these questions, OPR shows in detail the process that led to the NPA, from 
the initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.  
After a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive 
interviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions 
concerning the NPA’s origins and development.  Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth 
its conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.   
II. 
ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT  
Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knowledge of its terms.  He 
revised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate.  Acosta told OPR that 
he either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the 
case against Epstein.  OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled 
him about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta 
did not make such a claim to OPR.  As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged 
resolution, two years . . . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my 
authority. . . .  [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I . . . accept that.  I’m not . . . pushing away 
responsibility for it.”  
In making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.  
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña were involved in the matter to varying degrees, at 

134 
different points in time, and regarding different decisions.  Menchel, for example, participated in 
formulating the USAO’s initial written offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions 
or decisions made after August 3, 2007.  Sloman was absent during part of the most intense 
negotiations in September 2007 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he 
returned.  Villafaña and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions 
during the September 12, 2007 meeting with the defense and State Attorney’s Office, or at least 
indicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval.  In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s, 
Menchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafaña’s involvement, they acted with the knowledge and approval of 
Acosta.   
Under OPR’s analytical framework, an attorney who makes a good faith attempt to 
ascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given 
situation does not commit professional misconduct.  Evidence that an attorney made a good faith 
attempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not 
limited to, the fact that the attorney consulted with a supervisor.202  In this regard, OPR’s 
framework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars, 
which specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in 
accordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of 
professional duty.  See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b).  Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not 
find a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed below, OPR concludes that 
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña did not commit professional misconduct with respect to 
any aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval. 
III. 
OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND 
UNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR 
STANDARD, 
OR 
DEPARTMENT 
REGULATION 
OR 
POLICY, 
IN 
NEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA  
A central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of 
the subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and 
unambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy.  OPR does not find professional 
misconduct unless a subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous 
standard.  OPR considered three specific areas:  (1) standards implicated by the decision to decline 
a federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal 
investigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the 
NPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties.  As discussed 
below, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his 
decisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Attorney possessed broad 
discretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates, 
and that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous 
standard.  As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject attorneys violated a clear and 
202  
The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate 
attorney has not acted in “good faith.”  OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did 
not claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision. 

135 
unambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or 
entering into the NPA, including its addendum.  
A. 
U.S. Attorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as 
They Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute 
Epstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct 
The U.S. Attorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.203    
As a general matter, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to 
help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully 
executed.’”  United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, 
§ 3).  Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary 
classification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law 
or statute and are not subject to judicial review.  See United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 762 
(1997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, 
so long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).   
Department policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case 
helped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular 
prosecutorial decision in any given case.”  USAM §§ 9-27.001, 9-27.120 (comment).  Rather than 
mandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a 
prosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution 
in another jurisdiction.”  USAM § 9-27.220.  Importantly, U.S. Attorneys had “plenary authority 
with regard to federal criminal matters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth 
in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their 
individual judicial districts.  USAM §§ 9-2.001, 9-27.140.  As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United 
States Attorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Attorney General with the broadest 
discretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline 
prosecution.  USAM § 9-2.001.    
In addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline 
federal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance 
in the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other 
jurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute 
effectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other 
jurisdiction.  USAM § 9-27.240.204  A comment to this provision stated that the factors are 
“illustrative only, and the attorney for the government should also consider any others that appear 
relevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”   
203  
See, e.g., Wayte, 470 U.S. at 607; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 380 n.11 (1982); 
Bordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 409. 
204  
The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.240 to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is 
distinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to 
bring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal 
proceeding.  See USAM § 9-2.031.   

136 
As the U.S. Attorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was 
motivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the 
USAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate.  As discussed in detail below, 
OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or 
influenced by improper considerations.  Because no clear and unambiguous standard required 
Acosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the 
state, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal 
prosecution of Epstein.     
B. 
No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a 
Non-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein  
OPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to 
resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.   
The prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through 
a non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution 
agreement.  United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  These agreements 
“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal 
conviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a 
defendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability 
altogether.”  Id. at 738.  As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case 
through a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally 
with the Executive” branch.  Id. at 741. 
OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-
prosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case.  The USAM specifically 
authorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution 
agreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put 
the person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as 
testimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.”  USAM § 9-27.600 (comment).205  The 
“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of 
another person.  In certain circumstances, government attorneys were required to obtain approval 
from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement 
in exchange for cooperation.   
Epstein, however, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the 
USAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in 
circumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of 
another.  Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases 
involving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other 
situations.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous 
obligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution 
205  
USAM § 9-27.650 required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully 
memorialized in writing.  Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied 
by fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.  

137 
agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain 
Departmental approval before doing so.  
C.  
The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and 
Unambiguous Standards  
Although Acosta, as U.S. Attorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a 
non-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a 
clear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.  
Specifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal 
investigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution 
and solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an 18-month sentence of 
incarceration.  Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-
prosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating 
to plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements.  OPR also 
examined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,” 
to determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.  
Finally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the 
Department’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required 
further action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals. 
After considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to 
resolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous 
standards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea 
and through the terms that he chose.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit 
professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other 
subjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.206 
1. 
Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required 
Epstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an 18-Month Term of 
Incarceration 
Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a 
plea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.  
USAM §§ 9-27.330, 9-27.400; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).  
206  
OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafaña failed to comply with 
professional ethics standards requiring that attorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a 
client.  Attorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires 
the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.  See, e.g., FRPC 
4-1.1, 4-1.3.  The requirement of diligence obligates an attorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but 
does not require the attorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.”  See FRPC 4-1.3 
(comment).  Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those 
decisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence.  The subjects 
exhibited sufficient knowledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA 
negotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.  An attorney may 
attain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the 
requirements of the standard. 

138 
Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most 
serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal 
conduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes 
likely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect 
the investigation or prosecution of others.  See USAM §§ 9-27.430, 9-27-300, 9-27.400 
(comment).  The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal 
prosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial 
sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines.  However, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important 
exception:  a U.S. Attorney or a “designated supervisory attorney” may authorize a plea that does 
not comport with this policy.207  Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not 
“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the 
evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.   
By its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily 
provable charge” requirement.  The draft indictment prepared by Villafaña proposed charging 
Epstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors, 
and Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of 168 to 210 
months’ imprisonment.  The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-
negotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original 
state indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration. 
Instead, Epstein was permitted to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state 
indictment and only one additional state offense, and an 18-month sentence. 
As discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie 
perceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafaña outlined in the prosecution 
memorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which 
a federal prosecution would be premised.  On the other hand, Villafaña felt strongly that federal 
charges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice 
opined that the charges were appropriate.  OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question 
whether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, however, because Acosta had 
207  
In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional 
Circumstances,” as follows:  
Prosecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in 
other exceptional circumstances with the written or otherwise documented 
approval of an Assistant Attorney General, United States Attorney, or designated 
supervisory attorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing 
Reform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the 
federal criminal justice system.  For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss 
charges in a particular case might be given because the United States Attorney’s 
Office is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be 
exceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total 
number of cases disposed of by the office.  However, such case-by-case 
exceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be 
jeopardized. 
Ashcroft Memo at § I.B.6.  See also USAM §§ 9-2.001 and 27.140 (U.S. Attorneys’ authority to depart from the 
USAM). 

139 
authority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense” 
requirement. 
Although Acosta could not recall specifically how or by whom the decision was made to 
allow Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or how 
or by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to 18 
months, Acosta was aware of these changes.  He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it 
was signed.  Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding 
any arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.  
Furthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Attorney from deferring to a 
state prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state 
charges.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that allowed Epstein 
to resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an 18-month state sentence did 
not violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional 
misconduct. 
2. 
The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential 
Co-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous 
Department Policy 
Several witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute 
unidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the 
witnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy.  Although “use immunity” protects a 
witness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of 
the witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from 
prosecution altogether and is relatively rare.  
OPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Attorney from declining to prosecute third parties 
or providing transactional immunity.  One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied 
only to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth 
Amendment privilege.  See USAM § 9-23.100 et seq.  Statutory provisions relating to immunity 
also address the same context.  See 18 U.S.C. § 6002; 21 U.S.C. § 884.  Moreover, apart from 
voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not 
to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  See, 
e.g., Marquez, 909 F.2d at 741-43; Kemp, 760 F.2d at 1248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 909; Frazier, 
697 So. 2d 945.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s 
agreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that 
negotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted 
professional misconduct. 
Notwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of 
Acosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its 
potential consequences, including to whom it would apply. 

140 
3. 
The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation 
of Criminal Aliens  
  During the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the 
USAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to 
institute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants.  However, OPR considered 
whether the April 28, 1995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute 
Epstein’s two female assistants who were known to be foreign nationals—as Villafaña urged in 
her prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded 
the USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution.  OPR found 
nothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.    
The Attorney General’s April 28, 1995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal 
Aliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of 
removing criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.520, provided that 
“[a]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”  
However, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that 
would have triggered their removal.  But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed 
an obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did 
either provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad 
discretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions. 
The policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration 
officials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration 
authorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants.  OPR learned during its 
investigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.  
Moreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants, 
who, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further 
notification was required.   
IV. 
THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE 
INFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS 
FAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO 
EPSTEIN   
            OPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or 
Villafaña—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth, 
status, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or 
whether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation.  OPR 
considered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s 
July 31, 2007 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2007.  OPR also 
thoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were 
motivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense 
counsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally known attorneys; 
emails between the subjects—particularly Villafaña—and defense counsel that appeared friendly, 
casual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining 

141 
to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators.  These factors are analyzed in the following 
discussions throughout this Section of the Report.   
As a threshold matter, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the 
Epstein matter uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or 
personal consideration.  In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary 
record, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject attorneys.  The evidence shows three 
sets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA.  The first—of 
main concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.  
The second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and 
Lourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what 
some viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.208  
The third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s 
conduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.    
Although the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did 
not find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit 
Epstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth, 
status, or associations.  That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous 
wealth.  He was able to hire nationally known attorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive 
experience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations.  He had the resources 
to finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple written 
submissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings 
involving several of his attorneys and USAO personnel.  He assembled a defense team well versed 
in the USAO and the Department, with the knowledge to maneuver through the Department’s 
various levels and offices, a process unknown to many criminal defense attorneys and infrequently 
used even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy.  Access to highly skilled and 
prominent attorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or 
certain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes 
or violent offenses.  Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the 
outcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive attorneys, OPR concludes that the 
subjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper 
factors.      
A. 
OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity, 
or Illegal Political or Personal Consideration   
Some public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein matter implied that the 
subjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no 
specific information substantiating such implications was identified.  Throughout its investigation, 
208  
Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about 
the Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his attorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report 
that OPR should not attribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about how to resolve the case.  However, 
Sloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated 
in meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted 
in determining how to resolve the Epstein investigation.     

142 
OPR was attentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or 
other illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.209  Witnesses, 
including law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information 
indicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same 
witnesses of the Epstein matter’s outcome—stated that they did not.  Specifically, the FBI case 
agent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had 
perceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit.  The co-case 
agent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they 
were unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the matter because of illegal factors such 
as a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately 
have been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.  
B. 
Contemporaneous Written Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did 
Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly 
Influenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations  
Although Epstein’s name is now nationally recognized, in 2006 and 2007, he was not a 
familiar national figure or even particularly well known in Florida.  All five subjects told OPR that 
when they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein.  Similarly, the FBI case 
agent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of 
Epstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.  
However, news reports about Epstein’s July 2006 arrest on the state indictment, which were 
contemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm 
Beach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey, 
and Alan Dershowitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”210  Villafaña, 
Lourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus 
understood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.211   The FBI case 
agent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his 
connections.”   
1. 
The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing 
That the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors 
OPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the 
terms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential 
connections.  Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence 
that did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison, 
but the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.  Defense counsel mentioned 
former President Clinton in one pre-NPA letter, but that reference was made in the context of a 
209  
OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.  If OPR had found 
indication of criminal activity, it would have referred the matter to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.

143 
narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s 
association to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the 
defense argument that the matter should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.212  The defense 
submission to the Deputy Attorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection 
to former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and 
signed, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his 
association with the former President.213   
2. 
The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable 
Strategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences 
In addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject 
attorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making 
decisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in 
negotiating the NPA.  Villafaña, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal 
investigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she 
understood had been used with the State Attorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to 
counter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to 
Epstein’s tactics.  Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving 
wealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case.  Acosta told OPR, “[W]e 
tried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . how wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to 
do this because he is so wealthy.”  Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not 
believe “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.”  Lourie 
told OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case, 
but it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that 
the USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.  
Other witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents, 
who told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently 
because of his wealth.  The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO 
expressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth 
and influence.   
 OPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative 
evidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such 
motivations.  Of more significance, and as discussed more fully below, was the fact that 
contemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge 
resolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.214  OPR also 
212  
In the pre-NPA letter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable 
works, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel 
also noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a committed 
philanthropist.”    
213  
In the letter to the Deputy Attorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been 
“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”   
214  
OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors 
that influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.  Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and 
Villafaña all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with 

144 
considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring 
Epstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to 
victims—had been made by July 31, 2007, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the 
defense.  This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated 
any plans to do so.  It also was well before Acosta’s October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with 
defense counsel Lefkowitz, which received strong public and media criticism.  OPR also 
considered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course 
of negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end 
federal involvement altogether and return the matter to the state authorities to handle as they saw 
fit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender, 
despite a strong push by the defense that it do so.    
3. 
Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records 
Identified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal 
Theories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims 
Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content 
of discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for 
Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafaña 
identified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that 
either did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely 
influenced Acosta’s decision-making.  These considerations included assessment of the 
evidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims.  For the most part, however, 
these factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge 
disposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation 
through a guilty plea in state court.  That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns 
about intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement 
authorities.   
In a declaration submitted to the district court in 2017 in connection with the CVRA 
litigation, Villafaña explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation 
through the NPA: 
Prior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in 
negotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and 
weaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management, 
and informed them that most of the victims had expressed 
significant concerns about having their identities disclosed. . . .  It is 
my understanding from these and other discussions that these 
factors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and 
the various competing interests of the many different victims 
(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with 
the Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration 
for Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims, 
Acosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their 
colleagues, was motivated by improper influences.    

145 
and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were 
among the factors [that led to the NPA].215 
During her OPR interview, Villafaña similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to 
go forward with a trial: 
[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them how they 
wanted the case to be resolved.  And most of them wanted the case 
to be resolved via a plea.  Some of them wanted him not to be 
prosecuted at all.  Most of them did not want to have to come to 
court and testify.  They were very worried about their privacy 
rights.216   
In his written response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall 
the issues Villafaña set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the 
USAO in 2007.  Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about 
the charges and a potential trial: 
[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there 
was a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on 
appeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal

Doe v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafaña in Support of 
Government’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for 
Summary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2017). 
216  
These concerns are also reflected in a 2017 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation, 
in which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2006 to 2008, no victims expressed a strong opinion that 
Epstein be prosecuted.”  She further described the concerns of some of the victims:   
Throughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims . . . .  
A majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their 
identities to the public.  A number of the victims raised concerns about having to 
testify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.  
Additionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible 
exposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.  Overall, many of the 
victims were troubled about the existence of the investigation.  They displayed 
feelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to 
investigators.  Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused 
even to speak to us.  Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and getting to 
the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation. 
In addition, during the CVRA litigation, an attorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect 
the anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners.  See Response to 
Court Order of July 6, 2015 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2015).  It is noteworthy that in 
2020, when OPR attempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to written questions 
regarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about 
remaining anonymous.  One victim described to OPR how she became distraught when, during the USAO’s 
investigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a 
victim of Epstein.  At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her 
parents to know about the case.   

146 
record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of 
the names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed 
and the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their 
families. 
Although his emails showed that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein, 
Lourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the 
matter had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal 
prosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the 
cooperation and desires of the victims.”  
Similarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled 
understanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced 
additional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.  
Menchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein, 
Epstein would have elected to go to trial.  In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh 
the risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained 
through a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual 
offender, and made restitution to his victims.   
Sloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the 
government’s legal theories.  He told OPR:   
[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going 
to be reliable.  You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to 
be severely impeached.  People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who 
thought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I 
was 18 years old.   
You had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light 
being shown on them because their parents didn’t even know -- had 
very vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns. 
Acosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’ 
general credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which 
factored into the resolution.  He acknowledged that his understanding of the facts was not 
“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony, 
but he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make 
recommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case.  Acosta recalled discussing the facts 
with Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding 
of the facts as Villafaña.  Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably 
believed, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose 
significant evidentiary challenges.   
Other witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges, 
including the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims 
had expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and 

147 
d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.”217  The co-case agent told OPR that one 
of the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he 
generally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the 
victims’ identities.  In addition, the CEOS Trial Attorney who briefly worked with Villafaña on 
the case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she 
formed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward.  The CEOS 
Trial Attorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an 
extensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about 
potentially being labeled as prostitutes.  The CEOS Trial Attorney also told OPR that “there were 
obvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.218 
The contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal 
and factual issues or other concerns about the case.  For example, in an early email to Menchel, 
Lourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafaña’s proposed charges were whether the USAO 
could prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some 
minor victims had told Epstein they were 18.  He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there 
is some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum] as this is 
uncharted territory to some degree.”  In his July 5, 2007 email to Villafaña, Menchel cited Acosta’s 
and Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal 
issues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.”  Defense counsel raised 
myriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous letters to the USAO.  Defense submissions 
attacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have 
undermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of 
victim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and 
purportedly lied to Epstein about their ages. 
Acosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial 
issues,” his own focus had been on “the legal side of things.”  Notably, during his prior tenure as 
the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had 
been involved in efforts to address sex trafficking.  He told OPR that one of the “background 
issues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his 
view of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of 
prostitution.  Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable 
federal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a matter 
of state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in 
2007.219 
217  
In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2007, when he located a 
victim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “know Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved 
away to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”  
218  
In April 2007, a victim who was represented by an attorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded 
interview with the FBI, with her attorney and his investigator present.  This victim denied being involved in, or being 
a victim of, criminal activity.  Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”   
219  
In his March 20, 2011 letter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast, 
Acosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.”    Most 
of the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved 

148 
The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues 
presented by a federal prosecution of Epstein.  Villafaña, in particular, believed she could have 
prevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly 
recommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she 
continued to have confidence in the case.220  Oosterbaan and others also believed that the 
government would succeed at trial.  Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group.  Some of 
them were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein 
prosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear how many expressed a willingness to testify at a 
trial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein.  In the end, Acosta assumed 
responsibility for deciding how to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and 
benefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition.  His determination that a pre-charge 
disposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.   
Although evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about 
winning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge 
disposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as 
opposed to a traditional federal plea agreement.  OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records 
a memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a 
state-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.   
According to Acosta, “In 2006, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States 
Attorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage 
teens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.”  Acosta told OPR that he 
developed “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not 
stepping on something that is a purely local matter, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for 
the sake of the larger human trafficking issue.”  Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding 
that the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Attorney’s 
Office had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender 
registration.  Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest 
injustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.  
Acosta acknowledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have 
viewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a 
“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[, 
‘]encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[’]”  In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case 
lay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial, 
and a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration 
that would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.” 
Acosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both 
told OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had 
the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.  Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have 
played a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.   
220  
Sloman told OPR that Villafaña “always believed in the case.”    

149 
been concerned about policy and federalism issues.221  Sloman told OPR that although he did not 
remember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite 
policy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping 
our bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Attorney’s Office that 
was resolved by the State Attorney’s Office at some level.”  During his OPR interview, Menchel 
remembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried 
about “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although 
Menchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.   
C. 
Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the 
Subjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences 
OPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a 
suggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 31, 2007 terms was driven by corruption, a 
desire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.   
First, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was 
to benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him.  The NPA 
required Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism 
for the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the matter had been abandoned 
and sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate.  Epstein’s 
attorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation 
and that his conduct was exclusively a matter of state concern.  If the USAO had declined to 
intervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would 
have meted out the sole punishment for his behavior.  Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely 
would have received a sentence of probation.  Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on 
the wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no 
restitution for the victims.”  Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, however, the USAO devised 
a resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address 
the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the 
state’s original charge, standing alone, would have done.  Acosta’s affirmative decision to 
intervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather 
than exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that 
he was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.222  Similarly, despite defense counsel’s 
repeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to 
221  
Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was 
not.”  Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”   
222  
Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain” 
by showing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.”  Villafaña 
recounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense attorney who argued in one meeting that— 
we were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish.  We then pointed out that 
a number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish.  Then he 
said, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat.  And again, we 
pointed out that a number of us were Democrats.  So then it went to, we were 
prosecuting him because he was wealthy. . . .  That one didn’t work so well. 

150 
reconsider the provision.  Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely 
if his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s attorneys.     
Second, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA.  Immediately after signing the 
agreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the 
investigation inappropriate.  In addition to repeatedly attacking the NPA in his submissions to the 
Department, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of 
misconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel.  Epstein’s dissatisfaction 
with the NPA, and his personal attacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the 
agreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s 
benefit.   
D. 
OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense 
Counsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors 
Established That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided 
Improper Benefits to Epstein  
In evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media 
accounts to show that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly 
suggested that the subjects acted from improper influences.  OPR examined these factors but did 
not find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other 
improper motivation.    
1. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any 
Improper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships 
with His Attorneys 
Epstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple attorneys who had preexisting personal 
connections to some of the government attorneys involved in his case, in the State Attorney’s 
Office, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department.  Based on the attorneys Epstein selected 
to represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring attorneys 
with relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him.  One of the first attorneys who 
contacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida.  Villafaña and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was 
close friends with one of Lewis’s law partners.  Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former 
AUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized.  Later, when Epstein 
was seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay 
Lefkowitz, prominent attorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from 
his previous employment with that firm.   
Villafaña told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s 
attorneys.”  Critically, however, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in 
the following subsection, neither Villafaña nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed 
identified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an 
improper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or 
for any other improper reason).  Villafaña explained how, in her view, the “legal prowess” of 
Epstein’s attorneys had an impact on the case:  

151 
[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to 
describe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.  
It was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.  But because 
they were able to convince members of our office that it was 
somehow extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became 
who was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues.  And 
because of that, the legal prowess, if you will, of the attorneys [ ] 
[became] something to consider. 
. . . . 
I think that the ability of Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr and Jay 
Lefkowitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t know what I was 
talking [about] also, all came into play.  So I think there were a 
number of factors and it all came together. 
Although Villafaña was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she 
conceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy.  Certainly, throughout 
the case, Epstein’s attorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing 
nuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes, 
and the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to 
carefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.   
There is little question that Epstein’s extensive team of attorneys was able to obtain 
negotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core 
requirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein 
certain other concessions during the negotiations.  Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled, 
experienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with 
attorneys who knew how to obtain Department review of a USAO matter, thereby delaying 
undesired outcomes for as long as possible.223  Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, however, OPR 
did not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’ 
relationships with the attorneys he had selected to represent him. 
2. 
The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel 
Did Not Influence Their Actions 
Acosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did 
not affect his handling of the case.  Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former 
colleagues often became adversaries.  In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were 
useful because they afforded a defense attorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a 
prosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense attorney to “tailor” 
arguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO.  Menchel told 
OPR, however, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he 
“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting 
223  
As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many 
million dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”     

152 
friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s attorneys.  In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and 
his USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s attempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as 
“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”  
Sloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis 
and Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other 
colleagues and any of Epstein’s attorneys, but that in any event his attitude regarding cases 
involving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches 
with them.”  In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the 
equation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be 
best for the case.   
Lourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s attorneys “didn’t influence 
anything.”  Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s 
Professional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the 
investigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law 
partner.  OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility 
Officer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding 
relationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.   
Acosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on 
the term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages 
for the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s attorneys and before Epstein 
added Starr and Lefkowitz, the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys, to his team.  Acosta pointed out that 
the USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after 
Kirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.   
Acosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and 
Lefkowitz.  On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkowitz or Starr, he directed 
them to address their communications to Villafaña, Sloman, and other subordinates.  After his 
October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, Acosta immediately communicated with 
Sloman about their conversation.  In late 2008, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and 
was considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest 
and instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein matter.  On Acosta’s 
behalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department 
approval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible 
employment” with Kirkland & Ellis.  These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was 
cognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.224   
224  
In addition, in May 2008, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s 
Professional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein matter because he was 
considering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2009, and Dershowitz—a Harvard Law School 
professor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic 
or law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as 
a visiting professor.”  The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.   

153 
In its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email written by Villafaña in 
2018, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year 
sentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel 
as a favor to defense attorney Sanchez.  OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and 
determined that there was no merit to it.  Specifically, in December 2018, after the Miami Herald 
investigative report renewed public attention to the case, Villafaña recounted in an email to a 
supervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.225  In the 
email, Villafaña stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s 
decision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the following:  “Months (or possibly years) 
later, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from.  He said 
that Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (attorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and 
convince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”   
OPR questioned both Villafaña and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.  
Villafaña told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends.  During her 
OPR interview, Villafaña explained:   
[A] lot later, I asked Jeff.  I said, you know, “Jeff, where did this two 
years come from?”  And he said, “Well, I always figured that . . . 
Lilly asked Matt to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a 
strange term, . . . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in 
Epstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came 
from.  Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff 
Sloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to 
remind him of that conversation.  So Jeff doesn’t know where the 
two years came from. 
Because the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafaña 
whether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to 
defense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafaña 
could not recall precisely what Sloman had said.  At a follow-up interview, Villafaña again said 
that she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Matt to do her 
a solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Matt just wanted . . . to do her a solid.”  Villafaña stated 
that she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of 
exchange of . . . a favor in either direction.” 
During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could 
not rule out the possibility that Villafaña, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard 
that in some fashion.”  He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafaña about Menchel having 
done “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s 
not something that I would have believed.  Him doing her a solid.  I mean that’s the furthest thing 
from my recollection or impression even after years later.”   
225  
Villafaña’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein 
investigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding.  In her email, Villafaña 
addressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.   

154 
Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social 
relationship, which included, in 2003, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks.  We 
decided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”226  
Apart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was known 
in the office at the time.  Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically” 
when she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein 
investigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely” 
have been at office events and when she attended his wedding.227  Menchel added, “[T]hat was 
three and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s 
thought.”  
When asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term 
of incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did 
not recall how the office arrived at that figure.  In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that 
his relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case.  Moreover, 
Menchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was 
Acosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.   
OPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements 
to OPR from Menchel, Villafaña, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence 
supporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.  
The USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26, 
2007, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal 
case with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration.  According to the 
email, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense.  In the lengthy email exchange with Villafaña in 
early July 2007, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution 
was made with Acosta’s “full knowledge.”  Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that 
although he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based 
resolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense 
counsel “without having discussed it with me.”228  Moreover, the defense did not immediately 
226  
Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2007, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated 
Sanchez.  OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an 
obligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship.  The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it 
would depend on “how long the relationship was and how compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,” 
but he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta.  The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR 
that if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity 
of the [Epstein] matter, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it 
over.”  Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of 
dates, he would have advised his supervisors.  Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with 
Sanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have 
informed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in 
the Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality. 
227  
Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early 
2006, after she left the USAO.   
228  
In addition, Villafaña recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2007 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer 
a two year state deal.”    

155 
accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of 
home confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and 
did not view it as such.  The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of 
probation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail 
sentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early 
stages of the negotiations.     
As discussed below, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-
year offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the 
reasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to 
any other term of years.  Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of 
and approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.  
The only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of 
Menchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later.  Sloman, the 
purported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly 
disputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his 
understanding of that reason.  Villafaña herself could remember little about the critical 
conversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.  
Given the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence showing Epstein’s vigorous 
resistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in 
Villafaña’s 2018 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of 
Epstein’s attorneys.  
E. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense 
Counsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein 
OPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with 
defense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the 
NPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism 
toward or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.   
1. 
The Evidence Shows That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with 
Epstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations  
Although pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving 
financial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent 
in sex offense cases.  As the lead prosecutor, Villafaña vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s 
attorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them.  In Villafaña’s 
view, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those 
meetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 31, 2007 “term 
sheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”   
OPR’s investigation established that while the defense attorneys persistently contacted the 
subjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings 
actually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the matter.  As shown in the chart on the 
following page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed, 
the subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—

including one called by the USAO to off er the NP A term sheet resolution-and a sixth meeting 
together with the State Attorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea. Acosta 
attended only one pre-NP A meeting. After the NP A was signed and before Epstein entered his 
state guilty pleas, the subject supervisors and the defense team had one substantive meeting, one 
unscheduled meeting on a procedural matter, and a meeting with one defense attorney in 
preparation for a conference call; in addition, Acosta had the breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz. 229

In addition, all of the subjects took phone calls from various defense attorneys, and although numerous 
documentary re.cords refer to such calls, there may have been others for which OPR located no record. 
156 

157 
OPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests 
for in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual.  OPR questioned each of 
the four supervisory subject attorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with 
the defense.   
Lourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he 
told OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so.  Lourie 
recognized that some prosecutors—like Villafaña—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of 
“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is power,” and as long as the USAO did not share 
information with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all power to 
us.”  Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re getting the information that 
they think is important; that they’re going to focus on.  The witnesses that they think are liars . . . .  
And so you can form all of that into your strategy.”  Lourie also told OPR that giving defense 
counsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that 
helped ensure procedural fairness, allowing them to “believe that they are getting heard.”  When 
asked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever 
getting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that 
[Epstein’s attorneys] got.  But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”   
Menchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a 
defense attorney “an audience,” and there was no real “downside” to doing so.  Menchel added, 
“[W]hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being 
raised by the defense, and it’s good to know” what the defense will be.   
During his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel 
was unusual or outside the norm.  He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team, 
before the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense 
attorneys” who requested one.  Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Attorney to meet 
with opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution.  Sloman corroborated 
Acosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense attorneys, and that the 
USAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.”  Furthermore, 
Acosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense 
by the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements 
of the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual 
offender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.    
OPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the 
individual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic 
purpose.  The first meeting, on February 1, 2007, followed a phone call between Lourie and one 
of Epstein’s attorneys, in which the attorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the 
victims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview following that 
pitch.  Villafaña objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was 
not being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of 
Epstein.  The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follow-up 
meeting on February 20, 2007, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s 
witness interviews.  Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the 
defense arguments.  After Villafaña circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested 

158 
preparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up 
already.”230  The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the 
victims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR 
that such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored 
into the government’s charging strategy.      
The two February 2007 Villafaña/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and 
claims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2007, defense attorneys requested 
another meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a 
presentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution.  The request was 
granted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to 
us . . . to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.”  The requested meeting 
took place on June 26, 2007.  Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafaña provided to 
the defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges.  Defense 
counsel used that information to prepare a 19-page letter, submitted to the USAO the day before 
the June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position.  In an email to his colleagues, 
Lourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments.  A 
contemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña viewed the meeting itself as 
primarily a “listening session.”231  After the meeting, Epstein’s team submitted a second lengthy 
letter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state 
handle the matter.   
Menchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 31, 2007, to 
facilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed 
terms of a non-prosecution agreement.     
By early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys—Starr and Lefkowitz—joined the 
defense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I 
have not met with them.”  A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for 
September 7, 2007, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafaña, and Oosterbaan met with Starr, Lefkowitz, 
and Sanchez.  In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense, 
with Oosterbaan participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.”  In another email to Sloman 
and Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhow, if we don’t meet 
with them.  I’d rather keep it here.  Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so.  If our deadline 
has to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.”  Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,” 
but a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments.  Acosta said that he had already 
decided how he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our 
position.”     
230  
Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have 
nothing on at all.”   
231  
During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the 
government’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break 
in the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense.  She did 
not recall specifics of the discussion, however.   

159 
The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense attorneys, together with the 
State Attorney and the lead state prosecutor on September 12, 2007, was a necessary part of the 
NPA negotiation process.   
Even after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of 
the case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy 
Attorney General.  Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one 
substantive meeting with Acosta, on December 14, 2007.232  This meeting occurred in lieu of the 
meeting Starr had requested of Assistant Attorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense 
submissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with 
the USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.233  
Acosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear 
as if he “fear[ed]” that review.  Acosta’s nuanced position, however, was not clear to the 
Department attorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor 
of a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it.  Notably, though, none of those meetings 
or reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial 
advantage from his continued entreaties.   
In sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their 
purpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards.  OPR cannot say that the 
number of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside 
the norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense attorneys—that the quantity of meetings 
alone shows that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism.  In evaluating the subjects’ 
conduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and 
that the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic 
goals.  Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or 
Sloman knew or knew of the defense attorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it 
is also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense attorneys, including those who are known 
to them and those who are not.  Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile 
cases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request 
meetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department.  Most significantly, OPR did not 
find evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial 
benefit to the defense.  At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual, 
legal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the matter to the state to 
proceed as it saw fit.  The USAO never yielded on that point.  Accordingly, OPR did not find 
evidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafaña met with 
defense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused 
Acosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein. 
232  
Acosta’s October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz is discussed separately in the following section. 
233  
Starr and other defense attorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterbaan in March 2008.  Although Starr requested a meeting with 
Assistant Attorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Attorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.   

160 
2. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal 
Favorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel   
OPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the 
subject of media attention and public criticism.  The Miami Herald’s November 2018 reporting on 
the Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting that 
defense counsel Jay Lefkowitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriott 
hotel.  According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allow Epstein 
to serve “just 13 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shuttering of the federal 
investigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the 
victims and the public.234  Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that 
the meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shows that Acosta 
traveled to West Palm Beach on October 11 for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel, 
near the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October 12 he was to speak at 
the Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference.  After carefully considering the evidence 
surrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness 
accounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant 
concessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.   
Epstein and his attorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2007—more than two weeks 
before the October 12 breakfast meeting.  The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions 
resulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later 
addendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those 
key provisions remained in place thereafter.  Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations 
with the defense, he sought three goals:  (1) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense 
requiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism 
through which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein.  As noted previously, the 
USAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2007 letter expressed a “non-negotiable” 
demand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only 
an 18-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to 18 
months was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel.  The NPA signed on 
September 24, 2007, required 18 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a 
mechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these 
terms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.     
At the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, two issues involving 
the NPA were in dispute.  Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially 
changed the key provisions of the NPA.  First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change 
the mechanism for appointing an attorney representative for the victims.  This USAO-initiated 
request had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA.  Sloman sent the text of a 
proposed NPA addendum to Lefkowitz on October 11, 2007.235  Although OPR found no decisive 
234  
Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the 
deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018. 
235  
In his December 19, 2007, letter to defense attorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the 
addendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.   

161 
proof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkowitz and Acosta show 
that it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting.  Shortly after the 
breakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkowitz (copying Acosta and Villafaña), 
noting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the 
addendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the attorney representative.  Sloman later 
clarified for Villafaña that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”     
A second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s 
obligation under the NPA to pay the attorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the 
fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him.  Although this was at odds with the USAO’s 
interpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the 
provision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast 
meeting.  Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned 
attorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein 
under § 2255.    The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that 
Acosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue. 
OPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta 
and Lefkowitz.  In a letter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2007, two weeks after the breakfast 
meeting, Lefkowitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.  
Specifically, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (1) not to intervene with the State 
Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their 
counsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received.  Acosta told OPR that 
he did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense 
counsel attributed to him.  Acosta also told OPR that Lefkowitz was not a reliable narrator of 
events, and on several occasions in written communications had inaccurately and misleadingly 
characterized conversations he had with Acosta.   
Of more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an  
October 25, 2007 draft response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed 
and edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkowitz’s claims.  The draft letter stated:  
I specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was 
inaccurate in that October 23rd letter.  Your letter claimed that this 
Office 
would not intervene with the State Attorney’s Office 
regarding this matter; or contact any of the identified 
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil 
claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; 
and neither your Office nor the [FBI] would 
intervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein 
receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as 
that sentence does not violate state law.    
As we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States 
Attorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a 

162 
promise equates to the imposition of a gag order.  Our Office cannot 
and will not agree to this.   
It is the intent of this Office to treat this matter like any other case. 
Acosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkowitz for mischaracterizing 
what Acosta said during the breakfast meeting.  Although OPR could not find evidence that the 
letter was sent to Lefkowitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly 
after the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkowitz’s description of their discussions and had 
discussed those disagreements with Sloman.   
Nevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkowitz described in 
the October 23 letter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during 
the breakfast meeting.  First, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting 
that he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case.  Contemporaneous 
documents show that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did 
not want to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney or the state court.  For example, during the NPA 
negotiations, Acosta asked Villafaña to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State 
Attorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his 
guilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date.  Although Acosta may have 
made a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the 
state’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the 
subject, rather than any new concession.   
Lefkowitz also claimed in his October 23, 2007 letter that Acosta agreed not to contact any 
of the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel.  For the reasons discussed more fully in 
Chapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not 
stem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and 
considerations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta, 
Sloman, and Villafaña.   
Finally, Lefkowitz’s October 23 letter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene 
regarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was 
“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work 
release.”  Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, however, show clearly 
that Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision.  The NPA required Epstein 
to make a joint recommendation with the State Attorney’s Office for an 18-month jail sentence, 
although the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to 
all state inmates.  After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafaña, on behalf of the 
USAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also 
subsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release.  For example, in a November 5, 
2007 letter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by 
his agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that 
the Court impose a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.”  Shortly 
before Epstein entered his plea in June 2008, Villafaña wrote to the State Attorney to remind him 
that the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an 18-month 

163 
sentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement 
a breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”   
The guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2008 was consistent with the dictates 
of the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of 18 months’ incarceration.  
Epstein, however, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to 
serve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail.  The NPA did not reference work 
release nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County 
Stockade.  Moreover, Villafaña received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve 
his entire sentence of confinement “in custody.”  Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein 
work release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole 
authority for administering the work release program.  
After considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s 
October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest 
that the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served 
pursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work 
release.   
F. 
Villafaña’s Emails with Defense Attorney Lefkowitz during the NPA 
Negotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaña, or Other Subjects, Intended to 
Give Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or 
Other Improper Influences  
During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s attorney, and filed 
under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaña 
(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized, 
and thereafter.  These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkowitz’s side of the 
communications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafaña’s 
communications to Lefkowitz.  The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over 
Epstein’s objections.236  Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafaña’s emails as 
proof that Villafaña and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s attorneys to keep the 
“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public.  Statements in several emails in 
particular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism towards Epstein.  In one 
example, Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing 
not to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and 
all of the other persons that we could charge.”  She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’” 
to finalize negotiations.  She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal 
charges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press 
coverage.   
236  
The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal 
protected information.  United States’ Response to Petitioners’ Motion to Use Correspondence to Prove Violations of 
the [CVRA] and to Have Their Unredacted Pleadings Unsealed (Apr. 7, 2011).  The court declined to order the 
additional redactions.   

164 
OPR asked Villafaña about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with 
Lefkowitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense attorneys generally.  Villafaña 
acknowledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the 
tone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her 
supervisors had assigned to her:  
[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find 
that that is how I communicate with people.  I’m a Minnesota girl, 
and I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be.  And I can 
be when I need to be.  But my instructions from my supervisors were 
to engage in these negotiations and to complete them.  So I felt that 
given that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the 
agreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had 
agreed to, and do that in a way that is civil.  So . . . although my 
language in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications 
with Mr. Lefkowitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at 
the terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes, 
my response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”  
Villafaña denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide 
an improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question.  The email 
in which Villafaña expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all 
of the other persons that we could charge” was written in response to a defense proposal to include 
in the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not 
to prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees.  Lefkowitz had proposed that the plea 
agreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the 
initiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against 
[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate entity] for 
any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”  Villafaña told OPR that 
the USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who 
could be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties.  However, 
Villafaña was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to 
require the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might 
lead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the 
court not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty.  Villafaña was not the 
only one to express concern about how deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether 
such probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement.  In an earlier email, Lourie 
had suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allow the USAO more flexibility in plea 
negotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that 
required dismissal of numerous substantive counts.    
As to Villafaña’s offer to meet with Lefkowitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues 
in the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a 
“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate 
completion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time. 

165 
With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafaña told OPR that her goal 
was to protect the anonymity of the victims.  She said that the case was far more likely to be 
covered by the Palm Beach press, which had already written articles about Epstein, than in Miami, 
and “if [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the 
courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.” 
In evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafaña, as well 
as Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkowitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted 
from the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did 
not locate in the USAO records).  OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of 
Villafaña’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein.  The documentary record, 
as well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafaña consistently advocated in favor 
of prosecuting Epstein and worked for months toward that goal.  She repeatedly pressed her 
supervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the 
case.  She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because 
her supervisors agreed to those meetings.  Villafaña objected to the decision to resolve the case 
through a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with 
Menchel about that subject.  When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect 
that resolution, Villafaña fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position 
despite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.    
OPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense 
counsel.  Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafaña “was soft on Epstein . . . 
couldn’t have been further from the truth.”  Sloman added that Villafaña “did her best to implement 
the decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.”  Lourie similarly told OPR that 
when he read the district court’s February 2019 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails 
from Villafaña cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see how nice she was to them.  And she 
winds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them.  When I know the whole time she was the 
one who wanted to go after him the most.”  The AUSA who assisted Villafaña on the investigation 
told OPR “everything that [Villafaña] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro 
prosecution.” 
Because the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other 
information showing Villafaña’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a 
public narrative developed that Villafaña colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the 
expense of the victims.  After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that 
narrative to be inaccurate.  The USAO’s and Villafaña’s interactions with the victims can be 
criticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps 
Villafaña may have made in her interactions with victims or their attorneys were not made for the 
purpose of silencing victims.  Rather, the evidence shows that Villafaña, in particular, cared deeply 
about Epstein’s victims.  Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of 
consulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted letters to notify victims 
identified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to 
appear.  The draft letters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafaña 
and Sloman committed professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and 
unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” of the listed victims.  Given the full context of Villafaña’s 
conduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are 

166 
entitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them.  OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in 
question do not themselves establish that Villafaña (or any other subject) acted to improperly 
benefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence 
victims.  
G. 
The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña Agreed to 
the NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators” 
in Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential 
Associates  
OPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafaña, Lourie, 
and Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute 
“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine 
whether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism towards Epstein or an 
improper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s known associates.  Other than various 
drafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found little in the contemporaneous 
records mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—
or even gave it much consideration.  Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement show 
that the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” 
evolved from a more narrow provision sought by the defense.  The provision expanded as Villafaña 
and defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the 
NPA, with apparently little analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the 
provision.237   
As the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafaña circulated to Lourie and another 
supervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of 
[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and 
commenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.”  In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue 
237  
As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense 
sought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed 
employees of one of his companies.  Villafaña initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed 
“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that 
we could charge.”  Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkowitz after Villafaña’s email continued to include 
language referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees.  Villafaña, however, internally circulated 
drafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability 
of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal conduct by 
those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.”  The federal plea agreement draft revised 
by Lourie and Acosta on September 20, 2007, included that language.  When the defense team reverted to negotiation 
of state charges, Villafaña advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more 
willing to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.”  The next day, Lefkowitz sent a revised draft NPA 
referring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for 
any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”  The language was finally revised by Villafaña 
to prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named 
assistants].”   
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafaña’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution 
provision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges 
and a time-limited scope of conduct.  Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain 
such limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.   

167 
Villafaña had raised (defense counsel’s attempt to insert an immigration waiver into the 
agreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-
conspirators or ask Villafaña to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the 
government’s interests.  In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafaña asked Lourie for 
“[a]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input.  OPR found no 
document that suggested Villafaña and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other 
individuals who were copied on Villafaña’s email referencing the provision—her immediate 
supervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office, 
and Villafaña’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it.  Villafaña told 
OPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-
prosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafaña assumed that they agreed with her assessment. 
Villafaña told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision 
agreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that 
defense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame 
for what happened.”  Villafaña told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct 
was his own “dirty little secret.”  Villafaña said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2006 
arrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that 
none of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators 
about sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-known contacts about whom allegations arose 
many years later.238  Villafaña acknowledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime 
relationship with a close female friend who was a well-known socialite, but, according to 
Villafaña, in 2007, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”239  Accordingly, Villafaña 
believed that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the 
four female assistants identified by name.240  Villafaña also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s 
investigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he 
entered a plea.241  Because Villafaña was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged, 
she perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified 
“co-conspirators.”  Villafaña told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did 
not occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any 
of Epstein’s influential associates.   
Lourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the 
time Villafaña forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR 
that he did not know how the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.  
238  
Villafaña told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being 
involved in abusing them.  It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”   
239  
The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct 
involving the then minor did not occur in Florida.   
240  
The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one 
girl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the 
government’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset.  Villafaña explained to OPR that this individual was herself 
believed to also have been at one time a victim. 
241  
Villafaña told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.  

168 
Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told 
OPR that he did not know why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike 
me if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehow helpful.”  Lourie 
posited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein 
“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators.  He told OPR that when he saw the 
provision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to 
any victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”  
Acosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision.  But he told 
OPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed 
the federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful 
consequences” for his actions.  Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the 
extent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been 
the focus is on Epstein[ ] . . . going to jail.  Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other, 
lesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.”  Acosta also told OPR that he assumed 
Villafaña and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate.  Finally, 
Sloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood 
the non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never 
dawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else. 
This broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is 
troubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence showing that 
the subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was 
warranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete 
information regarding possible co-conspirators.  Villafaña precipitously revised a more narrow 
provision sought by the defense.  Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it 
appears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the 
time, the subjects believed that was the purpose.  However, the USAO had not indicated interest 
in prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record 
indicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the 
four assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company.  Accordingly, OPR 
concludes that the evidence does not show that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña agreed to the non-
prosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential 
associates.242        
H. 
OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein 
Cooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on 
That Basis 
One final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may 
have received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal 
242  
As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafaña included the provision in draft plea agreements 
and did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.  
Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2007, before the parties drafted the NPA. 

169 
investigation.243  Media reports in mid-2009 suggested Epstein was released from his state 
incarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern 
District of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns.  At the time, Villafaña 
was notified by the AUSAs handling the matter that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was 
providing “absolutely no cooperation” to the government.  In 2011, Villafaña reported to senior 
colleagues that “this is urban myth.  The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of 
it is true.”  Villafaña told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New 
York was “completely false.”  Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein 
cooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an 
“intelligence asset.”244   
In addition to the contemporaneous record attesting that Epstein was not a cooperating 
witness in a federal matter, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating 
witness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s 
investigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a 
basis.  OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion 
that he had assisted in a different matter, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense 
counsel to the USAO and the Department.  It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have 
omitted any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.   
Accordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided 
Epstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal 
investigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for 
cooperation in any matter. 
V. 
ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA 
Although OPR finds that none of the subjects committed professional misconduct in this 
matter, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal 
investigation through the NPA.  Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case 
and his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the 
federal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to 
manipulate the conditions of his sentence to his own advantage.  The NPA relied on state 
authorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over 
the process.  Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA, 
such as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release 
and mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision.  Important provisions, such as promising 
not to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with little discussion or consideration 
by the prosecutors.  In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a 
243  
See, e.g., Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex 
abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.      
244  
When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2019 press conference, in answering a 
media question about whether he had knowledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that 
“the answer is no.”  Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified setting to discuss intelligence information. 

170 
successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately 
addressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by 
obtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment.  Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO 
compounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of 
drafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed attention and review than it 
received.  These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and 
potentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.   
In evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that 
some of Epstein’s conduct known today was not known in 2007 and that other circumstances have 
changed in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify.  OPR has also evaluated 
Acosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allows for decisions that are made in good 
faith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could 
have been obtained.  Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality 
of the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he 
chose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would 
reasonably expect of an attorney exercising good judgment.  
A. 
Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea 
under Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application 
of the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the 
Significant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution  
The Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court 
opinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the power to 
prosecute for the same act.  Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in 
a rule permitting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining 
to bring a federal prosecution following a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except 
when necessary to advance a compelling federal interest.  See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 
at 28.  On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follow completed state 
prosecutions.  USAM § 9-2.031 (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state . . . 
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, 
or a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”).  When 
a state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply.  Indeed, even when 
a state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal 
prosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied:  a “substantial federal interest” 
exists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal 
interest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction 
on federal charges.  The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a 
minor part of the contemplated federal charges.”  
No one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial 
interest in prosecuting Epstein.  In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña identified five federal 
statutes that Epstein had potentially violated.  The CEOS Chief described Villafaña’s assessment 
of these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the 
facts of the case.  Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel, 
and the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.  

171 
Notably, in the early 2000s, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child 
sex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the 
PROTECT Act.  Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal 
interest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and 
the number of victims.   
It is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not 
reached a conviction, acquittal, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and 
certainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein.  He had been charged with one state 
charge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons 
without regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct 
under federal investigation.  Acosta acknowledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did 
not apply.  Moreover, the State Attorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption 
of prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding 
with the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement.  In these 
circumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication 
of the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.  
The federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual 
who engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had 
residences outside of Florida.  Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has little doubt that the 
USAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under 
the circumstances of this case.245   
Despite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy 
did not apply, and the State Attorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance 
pending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s 
role in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.246  In essence, Acosta believed 
that a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority.  He 
explained his reasoning to OPR: 
245  
In 2008, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver 
requests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would 
not apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim.  The office also noted that if other factors 
existed, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.  
246  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s 
concerns from those of the other subjects.  However, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his 
subordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal 
theories, he alone focused on federalism issues.  Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and 
devalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and 
counsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal 
issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater 
harm to trafficking victims.”  Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was 
appropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-
trafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the matter through the NPA, which, 
for the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and allowed Epstein to manipulate the 
state system to his benefit.     

172 
[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so 
here is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign . . . 
state, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind . . . the 
whole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state . . . 
is an independent entity, and that we should presume that what 
they’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except 
in the most unusual of circumstances. 
Acosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein 
would have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis.  In 
Acosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-
stop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”247  Acosta told OPR 
that he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s attention if the State 
Attorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration.  Acosta therefore decided that 
the USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein 
to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.   
Acosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted.  Acosta’s repeated references to a 
“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used 
in the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with 
a criminal case after a completed state prosecution.  Nothing in the Petite policy, however, requires 
similar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state 
prosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense.  The goal of the Petite 
policy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal 
government to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials 
involved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions 
regarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case.  Acosta told OPR that “there are any 
number of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state 
charges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and 
lets the state proceed.”  The fact that the federal government can allow the state to proceed with a 
prosecution, however, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in 
a matter in which a distinct and important federal interest exists.  Indeed, the State Attorney told 
OPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators, 
typically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”   
Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.248  
Despite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily 
provable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a little bit more” does not approach 
that standard.  In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent 
an “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,” 
and that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from 
the PBPD, the outcome might have been different.  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to 
247

Daily Beast. 
248  
Villafaña estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was 168 to 210 months’ imprisonment.  

173 
depart from the Ashcroft Memo.  He told OPR, however, that he did not recall discussing the 
Ashcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record 
suggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal 
investigation through the NPA.  Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension 
between federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and 
his broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other 
hand.  OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
too narrowly and through the wrong prism. 
Furthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy 
resulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision 
to pursue a federal prosecution would have.249  By means of the NPA, the federal government 
dictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had 
to obtain during the state’s own prosecution.  Acosta acknowledged during his OPR interview that 
his “attempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being 
arguably more intrusive.”     
Acosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative 
consequences.  Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting 
provisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain 
actions to the state.  In so doing, however, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement, 
making it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.  
OPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a 
mechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages 
of having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had 
practiced and with which they were unfamiliar.  Villafaña recognized that there were “a lot of ways 
to manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of 
negotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO 
was “giving up all control over what was going on.”  Villafaña also told OPR that defense counsel 
“had a lot of experience with the state system.  We did not.”  Epstein’s ability to obtain work 
release, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a 
clear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended 
on a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.  
Although the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject 
attorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be 
eligible for work release.  Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind 
of work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.”  Because work release was not 
anticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein 
from applying for admission to the program.       
249  
The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions.  It does not prevent state 
authorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution.  See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v. 
Nichols (dual prosecution for acts committed in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building).  However, in 
practice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the 
federal prosecution results in a conviction.   

174 
The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of how Acosta’s decision 
to create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal 
investigation led to unanticipated consequences benefitting Epstein.  Acosta told OPR that one of 
the core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge 
requiring registration as a sexual offender.  He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the 
beginning and from which he never wavered.  However, the USAO failed to anticipate certain 
factors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had 
a residence.  In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender 
registration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least 16 at the time of her 
interactions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a 14-year old victim.  
The victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a 
residence, was 16; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state.  As a 2006 letter 
from defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Attorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had 
thoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration 
requirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the 
USAO.          
Finally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s attention 
because of a concern that the State Attorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense 
counsel.  Villafaña told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with 
them at the start of the federal investigation.  Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with 
Villafaña, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was 
dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case.  Shortly before the NPA was 
signed, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Attorney’s Office 
was predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor.  Specifically, during the 
September 12, 2007 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with 
Acosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation 
of minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally 
specified.  The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to 
register as a sexual offender.  Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite 
the assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned 
out—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.  
Yet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been 
considered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about 
proceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful 
execution.     
OPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by 
this case.  He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman 
and Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for 
their assessment of trial issues.  Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and 
revised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement.  Yet, rather than focusing on whether 
the state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta 
focused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in 
part by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of 

175 
Epstein’s state guilty plea.250  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in 
this manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to 
do so reflected poor judgment.  Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive, 
his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrow, and his understanding of 
the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.251   
B. 
The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was 
Undermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative 
Steps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case 
The leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also 
troubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing 
evidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant 
leverage in negotiating with Epstein.  Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal 
investigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and 
concerns about whether the government could win at trial.  Yet, Acosta made the decision to 
resolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense 
attorneys before the investigation was completed.  As the investigation progressed, the FBI 
continued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time 
of the initial offer.  In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not know the 
full scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences, 
his criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might 
implicate other offenders.  In addition, Villafaña planned to approach the female assistants to 
attempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.252   Most importantly, Acosta ended 
the investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially 
significant evidence:  the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution 
of a search warrant.  
The PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home, 
which potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state 
250  
Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state, 
he would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to 
the FBI.  OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-
year sentence.  OPR’s investigation confirmed, however, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD 
Chief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the matter. 
251  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion 
that deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Attorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or 
a federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.”  Acosta also acknowledged that the USAO’s handling of the matter 
“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and attention.  No one foresaw the additional challenges that the 
chosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel 
too much wiggle-room.”  Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not 
challenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”  
252  
Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafaña identified three of his female 
assistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no 
significant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein.  The FBI attempted unsuccessfully to make 
contact with two female assistants on August 27, 2007, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands, 
but agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.             

176 
search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those 
cameras had been removed.  Villafaña knew who had possession of the computer equipment.  
Surveillance images might have shown the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their 
appearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated 
argument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors.  The surveillance video might have 
shown additional victims the investigators had not yet identified.  Such images could have been 
powerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their 
visits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation” 
case.   
Epstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence.  Villafaña 
told OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence 
to record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed 
her in the nude.  Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors, 
Villafaña and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained 
child pornography.  Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume 
that he may have transmitted still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet 
to be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling.  The interstate transmission of 
child pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire 
complexion of the case against Epstein.253  Villafaña told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what 
we suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed.  It also would have 
completely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”   
Because she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafaña attempted to 
obtain the missing computers.  After Villafaña learned that an individual associated with one of 
Epstein’s attorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s 
home, she consulted with Department subject matter experts to determine how best to obtain the 
evidence.  Following the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafaña took 
legal steps to obtain the computer equipment.   
Epstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the 
equipment.  In late June 2007, defense attorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply; 
in informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafaña stressed that “we want to get 
the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant 
as soon as possible.”  She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one 
week until July 17, 2007.  On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer 
equipment.  That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve 
253  
U.S.C. § 2251(a) provides, in pertinent part: 
Any person who . . . induces . . . any minor to engage in . . . any sexually explicit 
conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall 
be punished . . . if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual 
depiction will be . . . transmitted using any means or facility of interstate . . . 
commerce or in or affecting interstate . . . commerce . . . [or] if that visual depiction 
was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or 
transported in or affecting interstate or . . . commerce by any means, including by 
computer.   

177 
the federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year 
sentence.  The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which 
the FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a 
resolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug” 
without comment.  Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent 
recalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending. 
Even after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafaña 
continued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of 
the computer equipment.  On August 10, 2007, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose 
Epstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the 
defense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein 
at age 14 and had been photographed in the nude.  A few days later, Villafaña told defense counsel 
that she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”  
Defense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the 
upcoming meeting with Acosta.  After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the 
hearing, Villafaña emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off”; he replied, “Yes,” and the 
hearing was re-set for September 18, 2007.  As negotiations towards the NPA progressed, 
however, the hearing was postponed indefinitely.  Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest 
by specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached 
the agreement.   
Villafaña told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense 
team had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers.  She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact 
that the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the 
importance of the evidence.”    
OPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA 
negotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to 
postpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer 
evidence.  Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafaña’s efforts to obtain the missing 
computers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slowly” 
regarding the plea.     
Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafaña’s 
efforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.”  Menchel expressed surprise 
to OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by 
Villafaña, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.”  However, the contemporaneous records show 
that Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2007 of Villafaña’s efforts to obtain 
Epstein’s missing computer equipment.   
Villafaña kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer 
equipment.  She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the 
computer equipment; specifically, her emails on May 18, 2007, July 3, 2007, and July 16, 2007, 
all discussed her proposed steps.  Villafaña told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions 
about her proposal to obtain the evidence.  Lourie also received Villafaña’s July 16, 2007 email 
discussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly 

178 
with one of Epstein’s defense attorneys about it.  Sloman told OPR during his interview that he 
“vaguely” remembered the computer issue.  The documentary evidence confirms that he had at 
least some contemporaneous knowledge of the issue—when asked by Villafaña whether to put off 
a September 12, 2007 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so.  Finally, as noted previously, 
the FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the 
litigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.     
Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed 
of the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed, 
he was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment.  The NPA 
itself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process] 
will be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain 
[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal 
process] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the 
NPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed 
withdrawn.”  (Emphasis added.)  Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he 
gave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without 
understanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of 
evidence specified was “certain computer equipment.”  In addition, Acosta told OPR that he 
worked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about 
the case.  Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the 
evidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial.  Therefore, although it is possible that 
Sloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the 
computer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was 
on notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer 
equipment.    
Villafaña knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment 
was already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and 
potentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his 
computers disclosed.  Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefitted from 
abandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration 
of the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.254  
Instead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that 
could have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state 
guilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges.  By agreeing to postpone the litigation, 
the USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much 
earlier and on terms more favorable to the government.  The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in 
the NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant 
crimes and did so with apparently little serious consideration of the potential cost.    
254  
If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as 
leverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable.  Lourie suggested in his response to his interview 
transcript that the court might have precluded production of the computers.  However, OPR saw no evidence indicating 
that Villafaña or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafaña had consulted with the 
Department’s subject matter experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment. 

179 
To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence 
before reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a 
resolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues.  Every case is different 
and must be judged on its own facts.  In this case, however, given the unorthodox nature of the 
state-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different 
track than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of 
Epstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from 
Epstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal 
conduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences 
of pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flowing 
from the express terms of the NPA.  In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight 
of the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be 
pursued.  The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to 
pursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of 
all the costs and benefits of the proposed action.  OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully 
considered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.255    
C. 
OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of 
Incarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It 
Satisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution  
The heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency 
afforded him concerning his sentence.  After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable” 
24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an 18-month term of incarceration, 
knowing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only 13 months.  
Epstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis 
because the state allowed Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his 
sentence.  As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what 
should have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money.  He had to register as a sex 
offender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”   
Due to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant 
events, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of how the original two-year sentence 
requirement was developed or by whom.  Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject 
interviews:  (1) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled 
guilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years 
represented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding 
the need for a trial.  As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of 
the two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”  He elaborated, 
255  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or 
should have known about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration 
to pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed.  Acosta’s attorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in 
that level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that 
it was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him.  For the reasons stated above, OPR 
nonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater 
obligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.    

180 
“I’m reconstructing memories of . . . 12 years ago.  I can speculate that at some point, the matter 
came up, and I or someone else said . . . what would the original charges have likely brought?  And 
someone said this amount.”  Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this 
method, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather 
from conversations over a course of time.  Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had 
these discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman.  Villafaña was 
not asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it 
was made.  Villafaña told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a 
state charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence.  OPR also examined applicable state 
statutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact, 
facing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD. 
 On the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehow the 
defense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.”  Menchel similarly told 
OPR that he did not know how the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number 
that the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it.  Sloman told OPR that he 
had no idea how the two-year sentence proposal was reached.   
The contemporaneous documentary record, however, provides no indication that Epstein’s 
team proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made 
its offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration.  As late as July 25, 2007—
only days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel 
submitted a letter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein 
at all.  Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA 
progressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.   
The USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it.  The most obvious 
alternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that 
carried a harsher sentence.  If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under 
the federal sentencing guidelines, 168 to 210 months’ imprisonment.  However, it is unlikely that 
he would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the lower end of 
the guidelines.  Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein 
would opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines 
sentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks attendant upon 
a trial in this case.  If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed 
by offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c) for a stipulated sentence, 
which requires judicial approval.  Acosta rejected this idea, however, apparently because of a 
perception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule 11(c) 
pleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.   
Another alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried 
a maximum five-year sentence.  Shortly after Villafaña circulated the prosecution memorandum 
to her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and 
offering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea attractive.”  Similarly, before learning that Menchel 
had already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafaña had considered 
offering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served 
concurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding 

181 
indictment.  Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and 
defense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is 
questionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even 
extend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.   
Weighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution 
that ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a 
mechanism for the victims to recover damages.  These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern 
about intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would 
be sufficient to prevent manifest injustice.  Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the 
time that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of 
the conduct.  I think that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not if we took this case to 
trial, would we risk losing everything?”  
During the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept 
a plea for an 18-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-
year term.  The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made.  Villafaña 
attributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, but Acosta attributed it to a decision 
made during the negotiating process by Villafaña and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his 
attorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.  
OPR found no contemporaneous documents showing the basis for the two-year term.  
Despite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR 
was unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that 
term, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was settled on for the initial offer.  The 
term was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as 
OPR could determine, possible state charges.  Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the 
defense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and 
rather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the 
negotiations.  OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was 
tied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other 
traditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar 
crimes.  Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a 
punishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed.  As a result, the 
USAO had little room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to 
enforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration 
that was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly 
disproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.    
In sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him 
to arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his own goal of serving as a “backstop” to the 
state, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis.  In assessing the case 
only through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for 
a punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in 
addressing it.   

182 
D. 
Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA  
After the agreement was reached, the collateral attacks and continued appeals raised the 
specter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith.  At various points, individual members of the 
USAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given 
to whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach.  Indeed, on November 24, 2008, the 
USAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the 
agreement but ultimately took no further action.  Acosta told OPR:  “I was personally very 
frustrated with the failure to report on October 20, and had I envisioned that entire collateral attack, 
I think I would have looked at this very differently.”  
Once the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review 
by the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state 
guilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally.  When 
questioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to 
address Epstein’s concerns.  He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of 
Justice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object.  During his 
OPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he attributed to Acosta’s 
prior Department experience.  Sloman, however, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much 
process,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to 
keep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA.  Furthermore, Epstein’s 
defense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.  
Acosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order 
to proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort 
to obtain Departmental review constituted a breach.  Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was 
Sloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in 
collateral litigation that would further delay matters and make what was likely a difficult trial even 
harder. 
Acosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable.  A court 
would have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the 
Department and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient 
to negate the agreement.  However, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach 
was caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed.  For example, 
and significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and 
be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his 
guilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007.”  (Emphasis added.)  Acosta also 
agreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2007 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told 
defense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.  
Following these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that 
Epstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to 
comply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Attorney had at least implicitly agreed.   
E. 
Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process 
The question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s 
handling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which 

183 
the defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant 
term of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense.  As OPR has set forth 
in substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the 
prosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims.  Instead, the result can more 
appropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state 
crime and intruding on state authority.  Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had 
set, even when Villafaña and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta 
himself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.   
Many of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in 
greater consultation with his staff before making key decisions.  The contemporaneous records 
revealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants.  Acosta 
was involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case.  Lourie 
told OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Attorney get involved with this level of detail.”  
Menchel told OPR, “I know we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay?  And I’m sure with 
Jeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”  
Lourie similarly told OPR: 
Well, . . . he would have been talking to Jeff and Matt, talking to me 
to the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros 
Memo and . . . the guidance from CEOS, he would have been 
reading the defense attorney’s letters, maybe talking to the State 
Attorney, I don’t know, just . . . all these different sources of 
information he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you 
know, that he was, he was reading everything.  Apparently, he, you 
know, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff . . . .   
At the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels 
in the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knowledge of the facts of the case—
Villafaña and, to a lesser extent, Lourie.  Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution 
memorandum on his own, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through 
the front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.”  Yet, although 
Acosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as 
overseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions.  OPR observed that as a 
consequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ownership of the 
investigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.   
On occasion, Villafaña included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon 
which Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made 
traveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafaña.  Villafaña did draft a detailed, 
analytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have 
relied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.  
Despite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such 
as Oosterbaan’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafaña’s 
concerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA.  Acosta interpreted the state 
indictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that 
when making his decision to resolve the matter though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to 

184 
which Villafaña and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue 
a broader state indictment.   
One example illustrates this communication gap.  In a September 20, 2007 email to Lourie 
asking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for 
Epstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea 
agreements.  We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.  I 
didn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”  
(Emphasis added.)  In his email to Villafaña, Lourie attached Acosta’s email and instructed 
Villafaña to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkowitz].”  
(Emphasis added.)  Villafaña raised no objection to signing the agreement.  Acosta told OPR that 
he wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him know” if they did not feel 
comfortable with the agreement.  Villafaña, however, told OPR that she did not understand that 
she was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted 
her to sign it because he was taking an “arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his 
deal.”  The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity 
to reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA 
believed she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself 
from the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.   
As another example, at one point, Villafaña, frustrated and concerned about the decisions 
being made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded 
rebuke, Menchel rejected the request.  Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting 
Villafaña from speaking to Acosta, Villafaña interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could 
not seek a meeting with Acosta.  As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state 
resolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafaña.  Acosta told OPR 
that he was unaware that Villafaña had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with 
her if she had asked him directly.  OPR did not find any written evidence of a meeting involving 
both Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafaña—the person most knowledgeable about the 
facts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to 
offer the two-year term, and Villafaña said she did not have any input into the decision.  Although 
a U.S. Attorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel 
presented what he believed to be Villafaña’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware 
of Villafaña’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.256   
Two logistical problems hindered effective communication.  First, the senior managers 
involved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the 
offices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafaña and, to a lesser extent, 
Lourie—were located in West Palm Beach.  Consequently, Villafaña’s discussions with her senior 
256  
In her 2017 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that, given the challenges of obtaining 
victims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the matter 
was in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole.  The [USAO] had also reached that same 
conclusion.”  Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafaña in fact supported the NPA.  In her 
OPR interview, however, Villafaña drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that 
led to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—
that is, the NPA—which she did not support.    

185 
managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop 
by a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.257   
Second, key personnel were absent at varying times.  Menchel’s last day in the office was 
August 3, 2007, the day he sent to the defense his letter making the initial offer, and presumably 
in the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his 
outstanding work.  Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding how to resolve the matter.  
Similarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the 
NPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key 
provisions were continuously added or modified while Villafaña pressed to meet her late-
September deadline.  Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he 
was at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was 
traveling between the two locations.  Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing, 
when many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting 
or reviewing the NPA before it was signed.  Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a 
significant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding 
of the case and full ownership of the decisions that were being made.  Villafaña certainly felt that 
during the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta.  Acosta, however, 
told OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns.  Did 
it do the . . . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and 
Marie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”    
The consequences flowing from the lack of ownership and effective communication can 
be seen in the NPA itself.  As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the 
negotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited 
proposals previously rejected.  Meanwhile, Villafaña sought to keep to a deadline that would allow 
her to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement.  In the end, 
Acosta accepted several terms with little apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications. 
The USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable 
example.   As previously noted, the only written discussion about the term that OPR found was 
Villafaña’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her 
co-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and 
neither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafaña recalled any further discussion about the provision.  Although 
OPR did not find evidence showing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña intended the scope of the 
provision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision 
precluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct, 
within the limitations set by the overall agreement.  This broad prosecution declination would 
likely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient 
investigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no 
other individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not 
be developed implicating others.  Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third 
257  
In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s, 
he was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”   

186 
parties.258  The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a 
significant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification 
for the provision.  It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have 
itself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning 
immigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement.  The 
possibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal 
culpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused 
more careful consideration of the provision.          
Similarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with little apparent consideration 
of the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense 
interpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of 
the investigation.  Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release 
information as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would 
be violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master. 
Decisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province 
of the USAO to decide as it saw fit.     
There is nothing improper about a U.S. Attorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA 
or other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given 
case; indeed, U.S. Attorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.  
And Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical 
decision to resolve the matter through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could 
not be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time.  This case, however, was different 
from the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the 
usual plea agreement.  Contemporaneous records show that Acosta believed the case should be 
handled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case 
unlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight.  Acosta may 
well have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing 
258  
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR this provision was “very unusual.”  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney 
General John Roth commented, “I don’t know how it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified.  I 
just don’t know how that works.”  Villafaña’s co-counsel told OPR:   
[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed 
to do at the Department of Justice. . . .  I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . . .  
[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for 
example, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense 
which was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and 
nobody else.  I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was 
dealing drugs and their wife was involved. . . . And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s 
understood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you 
know the husband’s willing to go and take the weight . . . .  This is not one of 
those. 
Deputy Attorney General Filip called the provision “pretty weird.”   Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR 
that he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor.  A senior AUSA with substantial 
experience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for 
participants in such conduct.   

187 
from Villafaña and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision 
should have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and 
consequences of pushing the matter into the state court system, with which neither Villafaña nor 
the other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and 
possible means of overcoming those issues.  OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a 
meeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the 
state-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or 
before the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed.  As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,  
“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done 
and get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate how this train is 
moving?” 
Many features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions 
like the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able 
to manipulate the process to his benefit.  Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about 
some of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.  
There does not seem to be a point, however, at which those differing opinions were considered 
when forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him 
followed and attempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond attaining the three 
core elements.  As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of 
the problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful 
approach.  As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellow U.S. Attorney today, I 
would say, think it through.”259 
No one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor 
judgment by itself.  However, in combination, the evidence shows that the state-based resolution 
was ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process. 
From the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in 
prosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the 
investigation on a path not originally contemplated.  Having done so, he had responsibility for 
ensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before putting an end to 
a federal investigation into serious criminal conduct.  Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the 
full ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the 
line AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question 
the motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.  
Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of 
action that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an 
attorney exercising good judgment to take. 
259  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney acknowledged that “[t]he matter would have 
benefited from more consistent staffing and attention.”

CHAPTER THREE 
ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS  
AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS 
PART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
Chapter Three describes the events pertaining to the federal government’s interactions and 
communications with victims in the Epstein case, and should be read in conjunction with the 
factual background set forth in Chapter Two, Part One.  This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal 
authorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation, 
as well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions.  OPR discusses key events relating to the USAO’s and 
the FBI’s interactions with victims before and after the signing of the NPA, beginning with the 
FBI’s initial contact with victims through letters informing them that the FBI had initiated an 
investigation.  A timeline of key events is provided on the following page. 
II. 
THE CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 
A. 
History 
In December 1982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report 
outlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime 
victims.  The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice 
have gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone 
unattended.”260  Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the 
criminal justice system:  the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act 
of 1984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and 
Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the 
Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, and the Justice for All Act of 2004.261      
The CVRA, enacted on October 30, 2004, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed 
to protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”262  The 
CVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional 
amendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’

Bill of Rights in the VRRA.263  Following multiple Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee 
hearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an 
amendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise 
measure.264   
B. 
Enumerated Rights 
The CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed 
as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”265  
Initially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime 
victims the following eight rights: 
(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.  
(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public 
court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or 
of any release or escape of the accused.  
(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court 
proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing 
evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be 
materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that 
proceeding.  
(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the 
district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole 
proceeding.  
(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case.  
263  
See 150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004).  The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (1) be treated with 
fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender; 
(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the 
court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial; 
(5) confer with an attorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction, 
sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender.  42 U.S.C. § 10606(b) (1990).  The relevant text of the VRRA 
is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section 1.B of this Report. 
264  
150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004).  Although nine congressional hearings were held between 1996 and 
2003 concerning amending the Constitution to address victims’ rights, neither chamber of Congress voted on 
legislation proposing an amendment.  United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), GAO-09-54, Report 
to Congressional Committees:  Crime Victims’ Rights Act – Increasing Awareness, Modifying the Complaint Process 
and Enhancing Compliance Monitoring Will Improve Implementation of the Act at 16 (Dec. 2008) (GAO CVRA 
Awareness Report).     
265  
The relevant text of the CVRA is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section I.A of this Report. 

192 
(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.  
(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.  
(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the 
victim’s dignity and privacy. 
Although many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part 
of the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or 
by administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights 
were afforded.  The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C. 
§ 10606), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to 
provide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C. 
§ 10607(c)).  Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide 
victim services, which attach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-
enforceable rights that attach upon the filing of a charging instrument.   
In 2015, Congress amended the CVRA and added the following two rights:266 
(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain 
or deferred prosecution agreement.  
(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the 
services described in section 503(c) of the Victims’ Rights and

III. 
THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF 
“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION 
A. 
April 1, 2005 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review” 
In 2005, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s 
Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime 
victim.”267  On April 1, 2005, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email, 
concluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon 
the filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or 
prosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”268    
266  
H. Rep. No. 114-7 (Jan. 27, 2015). 
267  
OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive 
branch agencies.   
268  
The OLC 2005 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Attorney 
General from Deputy Assistant Attorney General John E. Bies (Dec. 17, 2010), published as Office of Legal Counsel, 

193 
OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and 
proximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus 
tethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a 
complaint.”  OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies 
the “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the 
‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have 
intended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.   
OLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation.  For 
example, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect.  Additionally, 
the second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings 
involving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a 
complaint.” 
B. 
2005 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance 
In May 2005, the Department updated its Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and 
Witness Assistance (2005 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.269  The 2005 Guidelines specifically 
cited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution 
of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their 
CVRA rights, which in 2005 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.   
The 2005 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA 
duties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a 
“corrections stage.”  The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights 
varied depending on the stage of the proceedings.   
During the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency, 
the Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest 
opportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and 
services available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.   
[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates 
compliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C 
§ 10607, which requires federal officials to, among other things, 
identify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive 
reasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide 
The Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 (Dec. 17, 2010) (“OLC 
Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2010)”) and available at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/ 
opinions/2010/12/31/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf.  “That [2005] informal guidance did not foreclose the 
possibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.”  OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2010) at 1.   
269 
The 2005 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.  The 
Department promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA, 
which instructed the Attorney General to develop and implement such guidelines.  Victim and Witness Protection Act, 
Pub. L. No. 97-291, § 6, 96 Stat. 1248 (1982).  The 2005 Guidelines were superseded in October 2011, as explained 
below. 

194 
information about available services for victims.  Therefore, even 
though [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if 
charges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may 
provide certain services to victims that may serve the same function 
as some CVRA rights.270 
The 2005 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges 
are filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.”  The “U.S. Attorney in whose 
district the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime 
victims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.   
During the prosecution stage, the 2005 Guidelines required the U.S. Attorney, or a 
designee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an 
offender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or 
rendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed.  The 2005 Guidelines required the responsible 
official to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court 
proceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”   
The 2005 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult 
with victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea 
negotiations, and pretrial diversion.  In particular, the 2005 Guidelines required the responsible 
official to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views 
about, prospective plea negotiations.  Nevertheless, the 2005 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to 
“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the 
victim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves 
confidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case 
and the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”  
Lastly, the 2005 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather 
than withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”  
The “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration 
following a conviction.  Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S. 
Attorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.    
IV. 
USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME 
OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION 
A. 
USAO Training 
As U.S. Attorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2005 updated Guidelines to USAO 
personnel with a transmittal memorandum dated February 27, 2006, stating that he expected each 
recipient “to read and become familiar with the [2005] Guidelines.”  Acosta noted in the 
memorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2005 
Guidelines and that new USAO attorneys who missed the training were required to view a 
videotaped version of the training “immediately.”  Acosta further noted that the USAO’s 
270  
GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.   

195 
victim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other 
areas for which United States Attorney[’]s Offices are now explicitly responsible under the act.”  
The USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual 
mandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.  
B. 
The Automated Victim Notification System 
Both the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim 
Notification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United 
States Attorneys.  The 2005 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to 
victims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or 
foreign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.”  The VNS is separate from agency 
case management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO.  Both the FBI and the USAO 
use the VNS to generate form letters to victims at various points in the investigation and the 
prosecution of a criminal case.  Although each form letter can be augmented to add some limited 
individual matter-specific content, the letters contain specific language concerning the purpose of 
the contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a 
sentencing hearing).271   
In the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during 
the investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system.  The FBI’s Victim Specialist 
exports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS 
database.  Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.  
At the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate 
seven different form notification letters:  (1) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation; 
(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights; 
and (7) investigation closed.   
After a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s 
Victim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.272  The USAO imports 
data from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS 
data.  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form letters providing 
notice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of 
plea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.     
271  
U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report 08-04, The Department of 
Justice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2008), available at https://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUSA/a0804/ 
final.pdf.  The 2008 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the 
format to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information 
in notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in 
the same letter.”   
272  
The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact:  the FBI title is 
“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.” 

196 
C. 
FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets 
The 2005 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that 
briefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-
witness coordinator or specialist . . . .”  At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents 
nationwide routinely followed a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for 
Victims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.”  The “Help for 
Victims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights.  The pamphlet stated:  
“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime, 
and it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you 
are afforded those rights.”  The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided 
victims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.  The pamphlet entitled “The 
Department of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and 
instructions on how to access the system.      
V. 
THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS 
A. 
August 2006:  The FBI Victim Notification Letters 
On August 8, 2006, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim 
Specialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim 
Notification Form” naming 30 victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional 
pertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.273  Thereafter, the Victim Specialist 
entered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS 
whenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial letter to a particular 
victim.  The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the 
[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”274    
According to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2006, the FBI Victim Specialist 
used the VNS to generate FBI letters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the 
eight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive 
current status information about the matter.  The FBI letters described the case as “currently under 
investigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued 
patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.”  The letters also stated that some of the 
CVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment:  “We will make our best efforts 
to ensure you are accorded the rights described.  Most of these rights pertain to events occurring 
after the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility 
of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.”  A 
sample letter follows.  
273  
These 30 were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not 
designated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed. 
274  
The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as 
far as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from 
[her], the Victim Specialist.”

VNS data logs, correspondence maintained in the FBI’s case management system, and FBI 
interview reports for the Epstein investigation reflect that, during the Epstein investigation, the 
FBI generally issued its victim notification letters after the victim had been interviewed by FBI 
case agents, but its practice was not uniform.275
B.
August 2006:  The USAO’s Letters to Victims
During the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim 
notification letters, Villafaña was also preparing her own introductory letter in anticipation of 
meeting with each victim receiving the letter.  Villafaña told OPR that she was “generally aware 
that the FBI sends letters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my
process.”  Villafaña told OPR the “FBI had their own victim notification system and their own 
guidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”  
Moreover, Villafaña “didn’t know when [FBI] letters went out” or “what they said.”276
Nevertheless, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters she drafted to interfere with 
the FBI’s notification responsibilities.   
In August 2006, Villafaña drafted her letters to victims who had been initially identified 
by the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file.  Villafaña told OPR that she “made the decision 
to make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory letter and determined to 
whom they would be sent.  Although these letters contained CVRA rights information, Villafaña 
mainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims know the federal 
investigation “would be a different process” from the State Attorney’s Office investigation in 
which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.”  Villafaña told OPR that in a 
case in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate 
275
OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an 
FBI letter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.  
Furthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI letter subsequent to her interview, and some 
FBI letters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents.  Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS 
data revealed some letters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file.  OPR 
could not confirm whether such letters were mailed or delivered.   
276
Villafaña, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did 
not review the FBI notification letters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA 
litigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 30, 2008.

questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.”  Villafaña directed 
the FBI case agents to hand deliver the letters “as they were conducting interviews.”  Villafaña 
told OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the 
filing of federal charges, and therefore Villafaña did not use a template or VNS-generated letter 
for content, but instead used a letter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”277   
The letters contained contact information for Villafaña, the FBI case agent, and the 
Department’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.  
The USAO letters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be 
notified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.”  The letters stated that, in 
addition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and 
potential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a 
list of counseling and medical services.278  Lastly, the letters advised that investigators for the 
defense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact 
Villafaña or the FBI case agent.   
Although the USAO letters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-
arrest or indictment stage, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters to activate the 
USAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed attached only after the filing of a criminal charge.  
Villafaña told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI letter and 
a USAO letter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO letter “was coming 
with an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].”  Later, in the course of 
the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of 
providing more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even 
before the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging 
decisions had been made.”279       
Villafaña informed Lourie and Sloman about the letters, but the letters were not reviewed 
by any of Villafaña’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management 
task.  Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified, 
because I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.”  Similarly, Menchel told 
OPR,    
277  
Villafaña told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she showed the letter to the USAO’s Victim Witness 
Specialist who “said it was fine.”  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not 
file a charging document in the Epstein matter, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not 
assume responsibility for victim contact.  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s 
victims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data 
concerning the Epstein investigation.  OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the 
USAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2008. 
278  
Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime 
supports programs and services to help victims of crime. 
279  
Villafaña informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions 
of individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide 
a higher standard of contact.”    

200 
[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider 
it to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim 
notifications occurred in every matter investigated or brought by the 
Office.  I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-
witness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that 
appropriate victim notifications occurred in every matter 
investigated or brought by the Office.  
C. 
USAO and FBI Letters Are Hand Delivered  
The FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met 
[with] the girls.”  The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO letters and FBI letters 
to some victims following in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a 
victim with a letter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to 
that set forth in the FBI letters.280  The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a 
few” letters to victims.  The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI letters to 
victims and she provided some FBI letters to the case agent for hand delivery. 
Nevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every 
right” with the victims.  She stated, however, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI 
Victim Specialist] giving the letter, me giving a letter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew 
that they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that 
they could call for that.”  The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected 
the FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and 
resources.”   
VI. 
AUGUST 2006 – SEPTEMBER 2007:  FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH 
VICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED 
Early in the investigation, Villafaña informed her supervisors that, up to that point, 
“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story.  Getting 
them to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.”  Between August 2006 and 
September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims.  On 
a few occasions, Villafaña met with victims together with the FBI.   Villafaña’s May 1, 2007 draft 
indictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafaña described the 
circumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.  
There is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to 
the FBI case agents and Villafaña concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and 
those discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome 
of the investigation.  Before the USAO entered into the NPA, however, no one from the 
280  
The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving letters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the 
conclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact 
information for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”   

201 
government informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through 
a state plea.   
A. 
The Case Agents and Villafaña Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about 
Resolving the Federal Investigation  
Villafaña told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask 
them how they wanted the case to be resolved.”281 
And most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea.  Some 
of them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all.  Most of them did 
not want to have to come to court and testify.  They were very 
worried about their privacy rights.  Some of them wanted him to go 
to jail.  But . . . [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with 
the State Attorney’s Office.  And so, I felt like sending them back to 
the State Attorney’s Office was not something that they would have 
supported.    
Villafaña told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about 
their safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the 
investigation.  In her 2017 declaration submitted in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that the 
two CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my 
role was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and 
allow the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”282  She also noted that some 
victims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would 
have on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”   
In the FBI case agent’s 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During 
interviews conducted from 2006 to 2008, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be 
prosecuted.”  She further described the concerns of some of the victims:   
Throughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] 
victims . . . .  A majority of the victims expressed concern about the 
possible disclosure of their identities to the public.  A number of the 
victims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents 
finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.  Additionally, 
281  
Villafaña created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with 
notations indicating several with whom Villafaña recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case.  The 
chart, however, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafaña told OPR that the information contained in the 
chart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim.  OPR was unable to determine the details or 
extent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2007, because Villafaña did not have contemporaneous 
notes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information 
about the victims’ desired outcomes.  The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential 
resolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.      
282  
In the declaration, Villafaña stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein 
prosecuted.”   

202 
for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible 
exposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.  Overall, 
many of the victims were troubled about the existence of the 
investigation.  They displayed feelings of embarrassment and 
humiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators.  Some 
victims who were identified through the investigation refused even 
to speak to us.  Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and 
getting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of 
the investigation. 
The case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and 
“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.  
Rather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to know,” and “wanted to forget.”283   
As of September 24, 2007, the date the NPA was signed, Villafaña informed Epstein 
attorney Lefkowitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed 
minors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.284  
Although the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafaña 
acknowledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding 
the agreement.”  
B. 
Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaña Expresses Concern That Victims Have 
Not Been Consulted 
Before the NPA was signed, Villafaña articulated to her supervisors concerns about the 
government’s failure to consult with victims.  
1. 
July 2007:  Villafaña’s Email Exchanges with Menchel 
In July 2007, Villafaña learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez 
a possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein.  Villafaña was upset by this 
information, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns.  (A full account 
of their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.)  In that email, she 
told him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you know is completely 
unacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me.  These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the 
283  
The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her 
April 2007 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”     
284  
The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the 
government was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255.”    
Although the charges Villafaña proposed on May 1, 2007, were based on crimes against 13 victims, thereafter, as 
explained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims 
as the federal investigation developed further evidence.  At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were 
based on crimes against 19 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.   

203 
various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”285  Villafaña explained to OPR her reference 
to the victims:   
[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which 
requires the attorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to 
confer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents 
to keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case.  So 
in essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to 
allegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these 
plea negotiations without letting us know about it.286  
In his reply to Villafaña’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally 
inappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that 
“[a]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Attorney to exercise 
appropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with” 
Departmental policy.  Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafaña 
responded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgotten voices of victims in this case should not be 
classified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”   
Menchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer, 
asserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary settlement 
negotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.  
Menchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion 
that even just having a general discussion is something that must be vetted with victims . . . is not 
even . . . in the same universe as to how I think about this.”  Menchel also observed that on the 
very day that Villafaña criticized him for engaging in settlement negotiations without consulting 
her, the FBI, or the victims, Villafaña had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the 
possibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state 
resolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.287   
285  
Villafaña told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”  
Villafaña stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the 
victim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the 
victims” but did not likely contain information as to “how they would like the case resolved.”  Villafaña asserted that 
Menchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.”  Menchel told OPR that 
the allegations in Villafaña’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line 
in terms of what the law is and the policies are.”   
286  
As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were 
filed against a defendant.   
287  
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafaña’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended 
only to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.  

204 
2. 
Villafaña Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to 
Consult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do 
Not Currently Recall Such Instructions 
Villafaña told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel, 
which took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the 
government’s obligation to confer with victims.288  Initially, Villafaña told OPR she was 
instructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims].  Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told 
why she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction.  In 
a subsequent OPR interview, Villafaña recalled that when she raised the issue of notification 
during the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.  You can’t disclose them.”289  
Villafaña remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.   
Neither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafaña was directed 
not to notify the victims.  Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view 
“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused 
on at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the 
NPA was signed.”  Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim 
notification was discussed.  Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any 
discussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter 
into a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein matter.”  Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not 
think of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO, 
because “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would 
have been “premature” to consider notification.290   
3. 
September 6, 2007:  Villafaña Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta, 
of Oosterbaan’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was 
Required  
On September 6, 2007, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the 
government’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafaña raised the victim consultation issue, 
advising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as 
[CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD] 
288  
Villafaña could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2007.   
289  
Villafaña also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause 
victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”   
290 
In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafaña’s claim 
about a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and 
inconsistent with other evidence.  OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to 
which Menchel’s attorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafaña’s assertion that she had received an instruction from 
a supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations.  However, it is also true that OPR did not find any 
reference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim 
consultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims.  This is one of several events 
about which Menchel and Villafaña disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require 
prosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the 
alleged meeting and instruction.      

205 
Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”291  Sloman forwarded this 
email to Acosta.  Villafaña recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly 
after he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that now.”  Villafaña did not recall 
Sloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction. 
Villafaña told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve 
been advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.”  Sloman did not 
recall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with 
them regarding the potential resolution of the case.  Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that 
we had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek 
approval from victims to resolve a case.  We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution 
in . . . filed cases.”  Sloman said that no one other than Villafaña raised the notification issue, and 
because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the matter, Sloman “did not think that we 
had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.”  Lourie told OPR that he had no 
memory of Villafaña being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.292  Similarly, the 
attorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the 
Department told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he 
“assumed that was being handled.”293     
Acosta did not recall the September 6, 2007 email, but told OPR that “there is no 
requirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state 
prosecution.”  Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding 
victim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the 
victims before entering into the NPA.294  Ultimately, Acosta acknowledged to OPR, “[C]learly, 
given the way it’s played out, it may have been much better if we had [consulted with the victims].” 
CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the 
CVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was 
not “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate 
291  
Villafaña told OPR that she referred to Oosterbaan in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and 
because I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].”  As previously noted, Villafaña’s 
statement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect.  Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires 
consultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement.  Moreover, Villafaña’s comments concerning the 
pre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement 
to OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate 
the USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent letters to victims in August 2006.   
292  
Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the 
office, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knowledge” of the case.   
293  
The AUSA who for a time served as Villafaña’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not 
“know anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the 
case.  The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do 
with the [NPA] negotiations.”   
294  
Villafaña told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order 
to . . . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”    

206 
disagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.295  Oosterbaan’s disagreement was based on 
policy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a 
position that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].”  Oosterbaan also told OPR that whether or 
not the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,” 
but he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:   
The people I know, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying 
to do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically.  I just 
disagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying 
. . . to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . . 
you can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on 
this and maybe it doesn’t sway you.  You still do what you’re going 
to do but . . . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean 
exercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t 
really know what [the victims] would say.   
Sloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point 
in terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into 
and [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the 
victims.”    
VII. 
SEPTEMBER 24, 2007 – JUNE 30, 2008:  AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE 
USAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS 
The contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the 
case agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.  
However, the emails also show that the USAO was unclear about how much information could be 
given to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s 
defense counsel regarding victim notifications.296  As a result, although the expectation in the 
USAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision, 
and the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense attorneys, 
who strongly objected to the government’s notification plan.  In addition, Villafaña and the case 
agents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision 
would damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial.  In 
the end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Attorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims 
about the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not 
provided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2008.    
295  
Oosterbaan stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with how . . . I dealt with 
[the USAO].”   
296  
The NPA nondisclosure provision stated:  “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part 
of any public record.  If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process 
commanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.” 

207 
A. 
September – October 2007:  The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the 
NPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential 
Impeachment  
In transmitting the signed NPA to Villafaña on September 24, 2007, defense attorney 
Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming 
public.”297  Villafaña forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach 
manager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.”  Acosta 
responded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required 
by law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media 
about the NPA, “this is the State Attorney[’]s show.”298  Acosta added, “In other words, what more 
does he want?”  Villafaña responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief 
or FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.”  Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is 
no reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy.  The [PBPD] Chief was 
only concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”299  Acosta responded that he would set up a 
call on September 26, 2007, to talk “about who we can tell and how much.”300   
Also on September 24, 2007, Villafaña emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to 
inform him that once the attorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to 
“meet with the girls myself to explain how the system [for obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. § 2255] 
will work.”  Villafaña also emailed Lefkowitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what 
I can tell [the attorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured 
Lefkowitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.”  Villafaña 
also provided Lefkowitz with a list of potential candidates for the attorney representative position 
and advocated for an attorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the matter. 
On September 26, 2007, Villafaña emailed Lefkowitz to request guidance on informing the 
victims about the NPA:  “Can you give me a call . . . I am meeting with the agents and want to 
give them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.”  Villafaña told OPR that 
because the government and the defense had not agreed on the attorney representative for the 
victims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to 
coordinate how to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would 
be an attorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.  Villafaña told OPR 
that the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be 
297  
Villafaña had assured Lefkowitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would 
remain part of our case file.  It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would 
distribute without compulsory process.”   
298  
Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have 
to “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOIA’d.”   
299  
Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefitted the victims were there for the victims 
to take advantage of. . . . and they did.  How . . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going 
to receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”   
300  
OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place. 

208 
involved in such notifications.  According to Villafaña, Sloman then directed her to have the case 
agents make the victim notifications. 
Accordingly, Villafaña directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them 
with information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”  
The case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as  
to . . . how we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but 
it was the terms of the agreement.”  Villafaña believed that if “victims were properly notified of 
the terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein], 
and he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.”  Villafaña 
“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court 
change of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first 
victims were notified [by the FBI].”  Villafaña told OPR that it was her belief that because the 
USAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the 
general public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what 
the agreement was about.”  Villafaña told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a 
concern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.       
Within a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had 
reached a deal to resolve the Epstein case.  For example, on October 1, 2007, the  
New York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes 
at his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months,” and noted that 
Epstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into 
possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”301     
The case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and 
“we would not be pursuing this federally.”  In October 2007, for example, the case agents met with 
victim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”  
According to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had 
been reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be 
a federal prosecution.”302  However, in a declaration filed in 2015 in the CVRA litigation, Wild 
described the conversation differently: 
[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State 
court and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other 
victims. I knew that State charges had nothing to do with me.

302  
The co-case agent recalled meeting with the victims about the resolution of the case, but could not recall the 
specifics of the discussions.   

209 
During this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement 
had already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein 
for federal charges against me.  I did not get the opportunity to meet 
or confer with the prosecuting attorneys about any potential federal 
deal that related to me or the crimes committed against me. 
My understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal 
investigation would continue.  I also understood that my own case 
would move forward towards prosecution of Epstein. 
In addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to 
Villafaña in an email: 
Jane Doe #14 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic] 
jail sentence and Jane Doe #13 has asked for our Victim Witness 
coordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much 
needed [p]rofessional counseling.  Other than that, their response 
was filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for 
pursuing justice and not giving up.303     
The case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and 
expressed “a sense of relief.”  Counsel for “Jane Doe #13” told OPR that while his client recalled 
meeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about 
Epstein’s guilty plea.  In a letter to OPR, “Jane Doe #14’s” attorney stated that although her client 
recalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein 
would not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.   
After meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if 
Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’ 
knowledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.304  The 
case agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the 
damages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial . . . [if] 
Mr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these 
girls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think 
it was right.” 
Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafaña] 
and said we’re not comfortable now putting this out there . . . because . . . it’s likely that [the case 
agent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”  
Villafaña told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe 
303  
The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an 
interview of them, it was a notification. . . . [I]f there was something . . . relevant [that] came up pertaining to the 
investigation, or something that I thought was noteworthy . . . I might have [recorded it in an interview report].”   
304  
Within limitations set by the Federal Rules of Evidence, a defendant may attack the credibility of a witness 
through evidence of bias, which may include the witness having received money, or expecting to receive money, from 
the government, the defendant, or other sources as a result of the witness’s allegations or testimony.   

210 
for [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafaña or the case 
agents removed from the case.   
Both the lead case agent and Villafaña told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafaña 
the concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of 
a breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for 
advice.  Villafaña recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional 
Responsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if 
you’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”305  In her 2017 CVRA 
declaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped 
notifying victims about the NPA.   
B. 
October 2007:  Defense Attorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications  
While the case agents and Villafaña considered the impact that notifying the victims about 
the resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns 
about what the victims could be told about the NPA.  As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA 
was signed on September 24, 2007, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the 
attorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.  
On October 5, 2007, when defense attorney Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a letter responding to the 
USAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone 
from your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the 
case” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and 
would prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified 
individuals at this most critical stage.”  Lefkowitz followed this communication with an October 
10, 2007 letter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should 
contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”306  Rather, 
Lefkowitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified 
individuals.” 
On October 23, 2007, Villafaña raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating: 
We also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome 
of the case and to advise them that an attorney will be contacting 
them regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein.  If we don’t do 
that, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected 
attorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.   
As discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2007, Lefkowitz sent Acosta 
a letter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 20, 2007, 
305  
The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about 
victim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein matter before the CVRA litigation was instituted 
in July 2008 and he was assigned to handle the litigation.  Villafaña told OPR that they consulted the Professional 
Responsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional 
Responsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”   
306  
Lefkowitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.  

211 
and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October 12, 2007, not to “contact any of the identified 
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this 
matter.”307  Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Acosta 
revised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkowitz, in particular noting that 
Acosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact.  The draft response, as revised 
by Acosta, stated:   
You 
should 
understand, 
however, 
that 
there 
are 
some 
communications that are typical in these matters.  As an example, 
our Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them 
that either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing] 
them.  Rest assured that we will continue to treat this matter as we 
would any similarly situated case.308 
In a November 5, 2007 letter, Sloman complained to Lefkowitz that private investigators 
working for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had 
discussed financial settlement with them.  Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are 
troublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of 
the matter, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed 
to pay damages in some circumstances.”  The same day, Villafaña emailed Sloman expressing her 
concern that “if we [file charges] now, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told 
you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”309   
C. 
October – November 2007:  The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate, 
and the FBI Sends a Notice Letter to One Victim Stating That the Case is 
“Under Investigation” 
Although Villafaña and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the 
NPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing 
potential victims.  In October and November 2007, the FBI interviewed 12 potential new victims, 
of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the 
307  
Villafaña later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general 
discussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”    
308  
Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO 
would not accept a “gag order.”  OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find 
any evidence that the draft letter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.  
309  
Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that 
such concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty.  In August 
2008, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafaña, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding 
that the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA] . . . because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA] 
applied.”  Acosta responded:  “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as 
potential witnesses.  Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to 
discuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”   

212 
NPA.310  The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the 
victims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case.  Villafaña acknowledged 
that she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the 
agreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and 
that we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”  
On October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice letter to a victim 
the case agents had interviewed two days earlier.  This letter was identical to the VNS form notice 
letter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the 
case as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.”  The letter listed the eight 
CVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision.  Villafaña told OPR she 
was unaware the FBI sent the letter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had 
identified all victims of the crimes under investigation.”  In response to OPR’s questions about the 
accuracy of the FBI letter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafaña told 
OPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2008, and “at this point we 
weren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically 
suspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.” 
D. 
The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Letter 
about Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal 
Investigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan 
In anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafaña reported on November 16, 2007, to 
Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with 
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, that the State Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify 
victims of the state plea hearing. 
[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.  The 
State does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the 
Court has to provide a separate room for victims who want to attend 
judicial proceedings, so I do not know how many victims will 
actually want to be present.311 
Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any 
coordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s 
state plea hearing. 
On November 19, 2007, Villafaña decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from 
the defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in 
writing.”  She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification letter, in which among other things, 
310  
Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list.  For example, one would not 
cooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third 
claimed she had no contact with Epstein.   
311  
Villafaña told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or 
two victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”   

213 
she would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s 
agreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve 18 months in county jail, and the victims’ 
ability to seek monetary damages against Epstein.  The letter also would invite victims to appear 
at the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a written statement to be 
filed by the State Attorney’s Office.  Sloman and Villafaña exchanged edits on the draft victim 
notification letter, and Villafaña also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t 
receive the original letters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the letter for 
those.”312   
Sloman informed Lefkowitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation 
(Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their 
rights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by letter after COB 
Thursday, November 29.”  Lefkowitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that 
it was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2004.  He 
argued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission 
prior to it being sent to any alleged victims.”  He also insisted that if any notification letters were 
sent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein 
has entered his plea” and that the letter should come from the attorney representative rather than 
the government.  On November 28, 2007, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña provided Lefkowitz 
with the draft victim notification letter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was 
to occur on December 14, 2007.313  
In a November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz strongly objected to the proposed draft 
notification letter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any letter to victims until 
after Epstein’s plea and sentencing.  Lefkowitz also contended that the victims had no right to 
appear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a written statement for such a 
proceeding.  In a November 30, 2007 reply letter to Lefkowitz, Acosta did not address the 
substance of Lefkowitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting 
collateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was 
dissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial.  Shortly 
thereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by letter that he had directed prosecutors “not to 
issue victim notification letters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time 
to review these options with your client.”  In the letter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that 
Villafaña had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary 
damages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during 
the investigation phase of this matter.” 
On December 5, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz sent a letter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman 
and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with 
312  
On November 28, 2007, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafaña that 
only 15 of the then-known victims had received victim notification letters from either the FBI or the USAO.  On 
December 6, 2007, the lead case agent reported to Villafaña that she was “still holding many of the original V/W 
letters addressed to victims from the USAO.”     
313  
Villafaña understood the state prosecutors had set the December 14, 2007 date, and emailed them for 
confirmation, stating, “[I]f the matter is set for the 14th, please let me know so I can include that in my victim 
notifications.”   

214 
the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.”  The Starr and 
Lefkowitz letter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim 
notification letter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the 
notification letter until after the defense was able “to discuss this matter with Assistant Attorney 
General Fisher.”  
The following day, Sloman sent a letter to Lefkowitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafaña, 
asserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
proceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled.  Sloman also stated that the VRRA 
obligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which 
they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing 
of charges, and the acceptance of a plea.314  (Emphasis in original).  Sloman added: 
Just as in 18 U.S.C. § 3771 [the CVRA], these sections are not 
limited to proceedings in a federal district court.  Our Non-
Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by 
allowing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.  The victims 
identified through the federal investigation should be appropriately 
informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.315 
Sloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafaña or the 
FBI case agent with questions or concerns:  “Again, federal law requires that victims have the 
‘reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in this case.’”  Sloman advised 
the defense:  “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed 
to Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation.  Those questions are appropriately directed to 
law enforcement.” 
Along with this letter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkowitz for comment a revised draft victim 
notification letter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense.  The 
letter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would 
plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend 18 months of imprisonment at sentencing, 
and Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The 
letter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing: 
As I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal 
investigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.  
Mr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on 
December 14, 2007, at ___ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley, 
314  
See 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(1)(B) and (c)(3). 
315  
Emphasis in original.  Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is 
simply informing the victims of their rights.”  Villafaña informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the letter, 
but she was the primary author of the document.  OPR notes that Villafaña was the principal author of most 
correspondence in the Epstein case, and that following the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the letter went 
out with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three attorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence 
before a final version was sent to the defense.     

215 
in Courtroom 11F at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 205 North 
Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.  Pursuant to Florida 
Statutes Sections 960.001(1)(k) and 921.143(1), you are entitled to 
be present and to make a statement under oath.  If you choose, you 
can submit a written statement under oath, which may be filed by 
the State Attorney’s Office on your behalf.  If you elect to prepare a 
written statement, it should address the following:   
the facts of the case and the extent of any harm, including 
social, psychological, or physical harm, financial losses, loss 
of earnings directly or indirectly resulting from the crime for 
which the defendant is being sentenced, and any matter 
relevant to an appropriate disposition and sentence.  Fl[a]. 
Stat. [§] 921.143(2).    
Sloman told OPR that he was “proceeding under the belief that we were going to notify [the 
victims], even though it wasn’t a federal case.  Whether we were required or not.”  Sloman also 
told OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification 
letters . . . I think . . . Marie and . . . the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some 
level.” 
On December 7, 2007, Villafaña prepared letters containing the above information to be 
sent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.316  
Sloman, however, had that day received a letter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing 
was scheduled for January 4, 2008, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim 
notification letters until “we can further discuss the contents.”  Also that day, Starr and Lefkowitz 
submitted to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense 
arguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  Sloman 
responded to Villafaña’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the letter.”317  Sloman told 
OPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] letter out,” but his instruction to Villafaña 
was “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.  
Sloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO 
“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . . . and the deal fell apart, then 
the victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary 
compensation.” 
On December 10, 2007, Villafaña contacted the attorney who at the time represented the 
victim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing 
victim notification letters.”  In her 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña noted 
that she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered 
316  
The FBI case agent had emailed Villafaña the day before stating, “The letter that is currently being revised 
needs to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.”  The case agent also 
stated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this letter.  My 
primary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”    
317  
Villafaña told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the letters; rather, 
she “just remember[ed] putting them all in the Redweld and putting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”   

216 
her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she 
wanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”318 
E. 
December 19, 2007:  Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to 
the State Attorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea 
Hearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as 
Required by Law”  
On December 11, 2007, Starr transmitted to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by 
Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of 
the investigation” into Epstein.  Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmittal 
letter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims 
put illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not 
being served.”  By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately 
provided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl’s attorney, even though it 
was clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a 
victim.”   
In his submissions, Lefkowitz argued that the government was not required to notify 
victims of the § 2255 provision: 
Villafaña’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of 
a restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification 
requirement under the Justice for All Act of 2004, a federal law that 
requires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available 
restitution, not of any potential civil remedies.  Despite this fact, 
[she] proposed a Victims Notification letter to be sent to the alleged 
federal victims.   
Lefkowitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate 
mechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of 18 U.S.C. § 2255, 
and a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights.  Lefkowitz took issue with the 
government’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification letter to the 
alleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so.  Lefkowitz further argued 
that the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a 
public, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.     
In a letter from Villafaña to Lefkowitz, responding to his allegations that she had 
committed misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had 
318  
As noted previously, in April 2007, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable 
to Epstein.  Villafaña told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a 
victim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal 
charging document.  Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately 
furnished to the defense.  The attorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by 
Epstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.  

217 
informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their 
allegations against Mr. Epstein”: 
None of the victims were informed of the right to sue under 
Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.  Three victims 
were notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general 
terms of that Agreement.  You raised objections to any victim 
notification, and no further notifications were done.  Throughout 
this process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though 
it would proceed to trial.  Notifying the witnesses of the possibility 
of damages claims prior to concluding the matter by plea or trial 
would only undermine my case.  If my reassurances are insufficient 
the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein 
should assure you of the integrity of the investigation. 
On December 14, 2007, Villafaña forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification letter 
previously sent to the defense, along with two draft letters addressed to State Attorney Krischer; 
Villafaña’s transmittal email to Acosta had the subject line, “The letters you requested.”  One of 
the draft letters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafaña, was to advise that the USAO had sent an 
enclosed victim notification letter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list 
of the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them 
with any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”319  The second draft letter 
to Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s 
allegations that the State Attorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and 
sentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender 
registration.  OPR found no evidence that these letters were sent to Krischer.320   
A few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafaña 
emailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?”  Villafaña told 
Sloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA] 
are the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in 
an unrelated matter].  We seem to be in a Catch 22.”321  OPR did not find a response to Villafaña’s 
email.  
In their December 14, 2007 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their 
lengthy follow-up letter to Acosta on December 17, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz continued to press 
their objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein matter.  They requested that Acosta 
319  
The draft victim notification letter was identical to the draft victim notification letter sent to the defense on 
December 6, 2007, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2008.   
320  
Moreover, the letters were not included in the publicly released State Attorney’s file, which included other 
correspondence from the USAO.  See Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available 
at http://sa15.org/stateattorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm. 
321  
OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.  
Villafaña told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on” 
filing federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”   

218 
review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly 
expansive interpretation” of 18 U.S.C. § 2255.   
In a December 19, 2007 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two 
paragraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties 
intended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they 
would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.”  Acosta also advised 
that although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation, 
the USAO would leave to the State Attorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state 
proceedings:  
I understand that the defense objects to the victims being given 
notice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing 
hearing.  I have reviewed the proposed victim notification letter and 
the statute.  I would note that the United States provided the draft 
letter to the defense as a courtesy.  In addition, First Assistant United 
States Attorney Sloman already incorporated in the letter several 
edits that had been requested by defense counsel.  I agree that [the 
CVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations 
of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.  We intend to provide 
victims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law.  We 
will defer to the discretion of the State Attorney regarding whether 
he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings, 
although we will provide him with the information necessary to do 
so if he wishes.   
Acosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this letter without running it by [Sloman], if 
not other individuals in the office,” and records show he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafaña.  
Acosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of 
whether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the 
role of the USAO, “to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state 
outcome.”322  Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the 
State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to 
question that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not  
assume . . . that the State Attorney’s Office is full of bad actors.”  Acosta told OPR that it was his 
understanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have 
an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”  Acosta also told OPR that the state would 
322  
Sloman’s handwritten notes from a December 21, 2007 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the 
defense, “Are there concerns re: 3771 lang[uage],” to which Lefkowitz replied, “The state should have their own 
mechanism.”  At the time of the Epstein matter, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded 
the “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.  Fla. 
Const. art. I, § 16(b)(6).  Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims 
are given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the 
victim[.]”  Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(a) (2007).  Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or written impact statement.  
Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(k) (2007).  Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family 
of the victim must be consulted by the state attorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the 
disposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.  Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(g) (2007).        

219 
have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence 
would also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”   
Sloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state 
court proceedings should be “left to the state.”323  Mandelker, however, had no memory of advising 
Acosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Attorney, and she noted that the 
“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision 
“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that 
I did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.”  Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that 
“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights 
under § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were 
going to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide how the victims were going 
to be notified.”   
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim 
list from the USAO.  She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard 
to contacting the victims. 
In response to Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter, Lefkowitz asserted that the FBI should 
not communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be 
heard at the sentencing hearing:  
[Y]our letter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s 
proposed victims notification letter was that the women identified 
as victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state 
proceedings.  That is not true, as our previous letter clearly states.  
Putting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom 
[CVRA] notification letters are intended are in fact not victims as 
defined in the Attorney General’s 2000 Victim Witness 
Guidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary 
injury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these 
women may be notified of such proceedings but since they are 
neither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this matter, 
they should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make 
sworn written or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein 
at such proceedings, as Ms. Villafaña repeatedly maintained they 
had the right to do.  Additionally, it was and remains our position 
that any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts 
by the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the 
execution of the Agreement should finally come to an end.  We 
agree, however, with your December 19 modification of the 
previously drafted federal notification letter and agree that the 
323  
In his June 3, 2008 letter to Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted 
with DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the following proposal [to defer notification to the State Attorney’s 
Office].”  OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision. 

220 
decision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst 
many other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision 
making.324 
Following a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, in which Acosta asked that the 
defense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications 
to the victims, Lefkowitz responded with a December 26, 2007 letter to Acosta, objecting again to 
notification of the victims.  Lefkowitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because 
the Attorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an 
offense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.  
Nevertheless, Lefkowitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not 
object (as we made clear in our letter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged 
victims.”  Lefkowitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice 
sent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses 
should be sent by the State Attorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO 
“should defer to the discretion of the State Attorney regarding all matters with regard to those 
victims and the state proceedings.”   
Months later, in April 2008, Epstein’s attorneys complained in a letter to Mandelker that 
Sloman and Villafaña committed professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly 
improper and unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” victims.  
F. 
January – June 2008:  While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department 
in an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating 
Epstein 
As described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through 
the end of June 2008, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely, 
implementation of the NPA.  Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s 
decision to have the federal case reviewed afresh.  A review of the evidence was undertaken first 
by USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial 
attorney.  A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS 
Chief Oosterbaan, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal 
Mandelker and Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy 
Attorney General.  Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.   
As set forth below, during that time, Villafaña and the FBI continued investigating and 
working toward potential federal charges.  
1. 
Villafaña Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein 
Will Breach the NPA  
On January 3, 2008, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state 
court, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2008, at which time he 
would plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea, 
324  
The 2000 Guidelines were superseded by the 2005 Guidelines.   

221 
“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal 
laws.”325   
Nevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that 
there was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and 
with his attorneys asserting that “the facts had gotten better for Epstein,” Villafaña came to believe 
that Epstein would likely breach the NPA.326  In January 2008, Villafaña informed her supervisors 
that the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared 
to [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with 
the vast majority of the victims.”  Villafaña then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with 
all the victims so that we know we can rely on them at trial.”327  Villafaña told OPR that at this 
point, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or 
send any victim notification letters—there simply was nothing to update.  I did not receive any 
victim calls during this time.” 
2. 
The FBI Uses VNS Form Letters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims 
On January 10, 2008, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification 
letters to 14 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their 
contact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the matter.328  The 
case agent informed Villafaña in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI] 
letter to all the remaining identified victims.”  These 2008 letters were identical to the FBI form 
letters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2006, and October 12, 2007.  
Like those previous letters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24, 
2007, the 2008 letters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his 
can be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough 
investigation.”  The letters also stated: 
325  
Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny 
Sheet,” Jan. 3, 2008.  
326  
Epstein’s attorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned 
unflattering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the 
exclusion of those victims from the federal case.  For example, defense attorneys questioned one victim as to whether 
the federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.  See Exhibit 9 to 
Villafaña June 2, 2017 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2006-CF-9454, at 44, 
50, 51 (Feb. 20, 2008).  One victim’s attorney told OPR that the defense attorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking 
highly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”  
Epstein’s attorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client.  For example, 
the Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and 
knew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.”  See Julie Brown, “Perversion of Justice: Cops 
Worked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.  Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 
2018.  
327  
Villafaña also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.  
328  
The Victim Specialist later generated an additional letter dated May 30, 2008.  After Epstein’s June 30, 2008 
state court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification letters to two victims who resided outside of the United 
States.  

222 
We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights 
described.  Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the 
arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become 
the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office 
to ensure you are accorded those rights.  You may also seek the 
advice of a private attorney with respect to these rights.   
The FBI case agent informed Villafaña that the Victim Specialist sent the letters and would follow 
up with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their letter.”   
A sample letter is shown on the following pages.   
Villafaña told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the letters at the time 
they were sent to the victims, or reviewing the letters until they were collected for the CVRA 
litigation, sometime after July 2008.  Rather, according to Villafaña, “The decision to issue the 
letter and the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.”  Nevertheless, Villafaña 
asserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was 
absolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in 
my supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.”  Villafaña identified 
various investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2007 until the end of June 
2008,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing 
victims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental 
prosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges.  Similarly, 
the FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and 
the investigation was continuing.”  The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s 
never been shut down.” 
Victim Courtney Wild received one of the January 10, 2008 FBI letters; much later, in the 
course of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this letter was that [her] case 
was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal 
prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”329 
329  
CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January 10, 2008 FBI letter that was sent to her counsel.

Villafaña, the FBI, and the CEOS Trial Attorney Interview Victims
As Villafaña resumed organizing the case for charging and trial, the FBI case agent 
provided Villafaña with a list of “the 19 identified victims we are planning on using in” the federal
charges and noted that she and her co-case agent wanted to further evaluate some additional 
victims.330  In Washington, D.C., CEOS assigned a Trial Attorney to the Epstein case in order to 
bring expertise and “a national perspective” to the matter.331    
On January 18, 2008, one attorney representing a victim and her family contacted Sloman 
by telephone, stating that he planned to file civil litigation against Epstein on behalf of his clients,
who were “frustrated with the lack of progress in the state’s investigation” of Epstein.  The attorney
asked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the 
matter,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.332  In late 
January, the New York Post reported that the attorney’s clients had filed a $50 million civil suit 
against Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to 18 months in prison 
when he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”333  
Between January 31, 2008, and May 28, 2008, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed 
additional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was 
signed.334  In late January 2008, as Villafaña and the CEOS Trial Attorney prepared to participate 
330
The case agent also informed Villafaña that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain 
additional information. 
331
The CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare 
for the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”   
332
Because Sloman and the attorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to 
Acosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.   OPR reviewed the matter as an inquiry and 
determined that no further action was warranted.

in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafaña informed CEOS Chief Oosterbaan that she 
anticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”   
On January 31, 2008, Villafaña, the CEOS Trial Attorney, and the FBI interviewed three 
victims, including Wild.  Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January 10, 2008 
letter stating that the case was under investigation; however, according to the case agent, Wild and 
two other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2007, that the case had been resolved.  
In her 2015 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI letter, she believed 
that the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential 
resolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in.  If I had been told of a[n 
NPA], I would have objected.”  In Villafaña’s 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña 
recalled interviewing Wild on January 31, 2008, along with FBI agents, and Villafaña told OPR 
she “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.”  Villafaña recalled 
Wild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to 
testify.”335   
After the first three victim interviews on January 31, 2008, Villafaña described for Acosta 
and Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims: 
One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview 
twice . . . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming 
after her and she started to break down again so we stopped the 
interview. 
The second girl . . . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had 
read about in the paper.336  She said that 18 months was nothing and 
that she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would 
rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time 
in jail.337      
Villafaña closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman attend the interviews with victims 
scheduled for the following day, but neither did so.338  Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical” 
335  
The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.   
336  
See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at 14 - $50M Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New 
York Post, Jan. 25, 2008.  As early as October 2007, the New York Post reported the 18-month sentence and that 
“[t]he feds have agreed to drop their probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to 
the new state charge.”  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal – Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” 
New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007. 
337  
Acosta told OPR, “The United States can’t unwind an agreement just because . . . some victim indicates that 
they don’t like it.”  The CEOS Trial Attorney recalled that she did not “think that any one of these girls was interested 
in this prosecution going forward.”  Furthermore, as previously noted, the CEOS Trial Attorney also opined that “[the 
victims] would have testified for us,” but the case would have required an extensive amount of “victim management,” 
as the girls were “deeply embarrassed” that they “were going to be called prostitutes.”     
338  
OPR located FBI interview reports relating to only one February 1, 2008 victim interview.  Although 
Villafaña’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, OPR 
located no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.  OPR located undated handwritten notes Villafaña 

226 
for him, as U.S. Attorney, to attend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was 
questioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.”  Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never 
gone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”    
Villafaña told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had 
been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafaña 
did not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had 
these terms.”  Villafaña also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want 
there to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their 
claims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.”  Rather, 
according to Villafaña, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where 
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually 
perform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”  
Villafaña recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing 
the case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.”  Villafaña 
recalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it 
so low” and Villafaña answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”339   
With regard to the victims Villafaña interviewed who had not received an FBI notification 
in October 2007, Villafaña recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they 
discussed the agreement.  She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an 
agreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “pretty sure” that she did not mention the 
agreement during the interview of the third victim.  Villafaña explained that she likely did not 
discuss the agreement because  
at that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent.  [The victim] didn’t 
know anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was 
going to end up being thrown on the heap, and I didn’t want to -- . . . 
if you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admitted that he’s guilty, 
like, I didn’t want that to color her statement.  I just wanted to get 
the facts of the case. 
The CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims 
about the NPA or the status of the case.340  She did remember explaining the significance of the 
prosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein.  The FBI case 
agent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2008 interviews.  OPR located notes to an FBI 
interview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted.  Attorneys 
for the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the 
resolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2020, their clients had no memory of meeting with 
authored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the 
investigation or the resolution of the case.  Through her attorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having 
contact with anyone from the USAO.       
339  
Villafaña did not recall any other specific questions from victims.  
340  
The CEOS Trial Attorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were 
generally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.  

227 
prosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the 
plea was entered on June 30, 2008.   
When asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims, 
Villafaña told OPR: 
From my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it 
was an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment.  You 
know, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal 
process], . . .  I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a 
federal indictment and a federal trial.  So to me, saying to a victim 
the case is now back under investigation is perfectly accurate.

February – March 2008:  Villafaña Takes Additional Steps to Prepare 
for a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Attorneys for 
Victims, and Cautions about Continued Delay 
In February 2008, Villafaña revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental 
memorandum.  Villafaña removed some victims known to Epstein from the PBPD investigation 
and others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly 
discovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.   
While the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of 
the Department, Villafaña sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and 
attempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some 
victims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.  
Villafaña reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service 
organization” to provide attorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some 
victims to provide contact information for the attorneys.341  During this period, an attorney from 
the victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.  
Villafaña also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit 
suicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case:  “I just can’t stress 
enough how important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.  The ‘please be patient’ 
answer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the attack while we are 
forced to wait on the sidelines.” 
5. 
March – April 2008:  Villafaña Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal 
Charges 
Villafaña continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing 
others who had filed civil suits against Epstein.  Villafaña also prepared search warrants for digital 
341  
The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafaña that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them 
of the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime 
are afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”   

228 
camera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted 
images that could contain child pornography.342   
By early April 2008, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal 
Division, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafaña and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein 
were “more and more likely.”  Villafaña asked Oosterbaan for help to “move this [Criminal 
Division review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s 
case by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents 
and the victims” were “losing their patience.”   
On April 24, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior 
asking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had 
expressed to Oosterbaan.  Villafaña further cautioned that, although she was planning to file 
charges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the 
agents, and the police officers to decide how the case will be resolved and to provide them with an 
explanation for the delay.”  Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its 
review of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, however, Villafaña did not file charges that day.  
VIII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED 
MATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION 
During the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA 
by entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict 
between the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights attached upon the filing of a 
criminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary.  The contemporaneous 
communications confirm that in 2008, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy 
regarding the issue.   
Unrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April 18, 2008, Acosta and Sloman received a 
citizen complaint from an attorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the 
Florida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights.  The attorney asserted that the CVRA 
guaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was 
the victim of a federal crime.  Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division 
Chief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2005 Guidelines, “our obligations 
under [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.”  On April 24, 2008, the Appellate 
Division Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her] 
reading of [the 2005 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not 
triggered until a case is filed.”343   
On May 7, 2008, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s 
342  
The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.  
343  
The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the 
initiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations 
to the victim.   

229 
CVRA rights attach prior to the filing of criminal charges.344  The Appellate Division Chief noted 
that, although the holding conflicted with the 2005 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.” 
Dean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2005 explosion at an oil refinery 
operated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed 15 people and injured more than 
170.  Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without 
notifying the victims.  The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the 
potential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such 
notification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations.  The court 
then entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea 
agreement until after it had been signed by the parties.  Thereafter, the government filed a criminal 
information, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices 
of the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard.  One month later, 12 
victims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights 
under the CVRA.  The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to 
confer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s 
dignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.345  The district court noted that the 
legislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as 
being a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.   
In denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court 
“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”346  In particular, the Fifth Circuit 
cited the district court’s acknowledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that 
apply before any prosecution is underway.”  The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation 
was not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is 
only a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before 
ultimately exercising its broad discretion.”  In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department 
components wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning 
whether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution. 
IX. 
JUNE 2008:  VILLAFAÑA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY 
REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA 
PETITIONERS 
According to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her attorney, Bradley Edwards, 
Wild retained Edwards in June 2008 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from 
the [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey 
Epstein.”347  Villafaña told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of 
344  
In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008).  The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida, 
which is within the Eleventh Circuit.  
345  
United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2008 WL 501321, at *11 (S.D. Tex. 2008).  Victims who 
wished to be heard were permitted to speak at the plea hearing.   
346  
Dean, 527 F.3d at 394. 
347  
Before Epstein’s state court plea hearing, Edwards also began representing the victim who became Jane Doe 
#2.  Although OPR focuses on Villafaña’s communications with Edwards in this section, OPR notes that Villafaña 

230 
an instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of 
the FBI case agents.  
Edwards contacted Villafaña by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had 
“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”348  In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that 
during multiple telephone calls with Villafaña, he “asked very specific questions about what stage 
the investigation was in,” and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because 
the matter “was an on-going active investigation[.]”  Edwards attested that Villafaña gave him “the 
impression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, 
both in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”349   
In her written response to OPR, Villafaña said that she “listened more than [she] spoke” 
during these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea: 
Given the uncertainty of the situation – Epstein was still challenging 
our ability to prosecute him federally, pressing allegations of 
prosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate better plea terms, 
while the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving towards 
[filing charges] – I did not feel comfortable sharing any information 
about the case.  It is also my practice not to talk about status before 
the grand jury.   
In her 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña explained that during these 
exchanges, Villafaña did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not 
know whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court 
guilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”350  Villafaña told OPR that she did not inform Edwards 
also had interactions with other victims’ attorneys.  For example, another attorney informed OPR that he spoke to 
Villafaña two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under 
investigation.  The attorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafaña].  We were never told what was 
happening or going on to any extent.”  Villafaña’s counsel told OPR that Villafaña did not have any interaction with 
the attorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her written communications 
responding to the attorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible.  OPR found no documentation 
that Villafaña’s communications with the attorney occurred prior to June 30, 2008.  Villafaña also had more ministerial 
interactions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases.  For example, in March 
2008, one victim’s attorney informed Villafaña of his representation of a victim and requested that the government 
provide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s 
airplane.  Villafaña responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep 
her updated about the civil litigation.    
348  
Villafaña later stated in a July 9, 2008 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited 
Edwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”  
349  
Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other 
attorneys who were representing victims.   
350  
The government later admitted in court filings that Villafaña and Edwards “discussed the possibility of 
federal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.”  Doe, Government’s Response to 
Petitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment 
at 14, ¶101 (June 6, 2017).   

231 
about the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and 
leading towards” the filing of charges.  Villafaña recalled mentioning the conversation to her 
supervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance 
to us and . . . could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and 
should be prosecuted.”  
Nevertheless, when OPR asked Villafaña why she did not inform Edwards of the same 
information that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2007 and January 2008, 
Villafaña explained that she felt “prohibited”: 
At the time that I spoke with him, you know, there had been all of 
this . . . letter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I 
had been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose 
things further and not to have any involvement in victim 
notification, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him 
about the existence of the NPA. 
X. 
JUNE 2008:  EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 30, 2008 PLEA 
HEARING 
The Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2008, when the 
Deputy Attorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and 
Epstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such 
a decision.  Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña notified Lefkowitz that 
Epstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to 
begin his sentence of imprisonment.”  That same day, Villafaña made plans to file charges on July 
1, 2008, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 30 deadline. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, Villafaña received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement 
and learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on Monday, June 30, 2008.  Also on 
that Friday, Villafaña submitted to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final” 
proposed federal indictment of Epstein. 
Villafaña and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose, 
for § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña contacted 
PBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing.  Villafaña told OPR that 
Sloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the 
plea.”351  On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief 
Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”352  
351  
Villafaña further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the 
upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator, 
and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”        
352  
Sloman replied, “Good.”  

232 
Villafaña told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims, 
including their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.  Villafaña recalled 
that Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy 
the list afterwards.  Villafaña did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the 
State Attorney’s Office.” 
In his 2009 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafaña sent him a letter “around the time of 
sentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the 
letter after he reviewed it.  Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the 
state grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had 
identified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our 
victims.”353 
In her 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she and the PBPD 
“attempted to notify the victims about [the June 30] hearing in the short time available to us.”354  
In her 2008 declaration, however, Villafaña conceded that “all known victims were not notified.”    
Villafaña told OPR that Edwards was the only victim attorney she was authorized to 
contact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 30, 2008 plea hearing because Edwards 
“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.”  Villafaña recalled, “I was told that I could 
inform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”355  In her 2008 
declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she called Edwards and informed him of 
the plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafaña stated that Edwards told her that he could not 
attend the hearing but “someone” would be present.  In a later filing in the CVRA litigation, 
however, Edwards asserted that Villafaña told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state 
solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of 
the federally-identified victims.”356  Edwards further claimed that because Villafaña failed to 
inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal 
prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not attend the hearing.  Villafaña told 
OPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allow Edwards and his clients 
the ability to comment on the resolution: 
353  
Reiter showed the letter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the 
state case were included on that.”  The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed 
it.”  The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter showed it to him.          
354  
The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”   
355  
Villafaña told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not 
“remember the specifics of the conversation.”  
356  
Villafaña stated that she “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and 
neither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a 
specific victim.”  Although Edwards criticized Villafaña’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published 
book, Edwards described Villafaña as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in 
the victims and tr[ied] . . .  to bring down Jeffrey Epstein.”  Bradley J. Edwards with Brittany Henderson, Relentless 
Pursuit at 380 (Gallery Books 2020). 

233 
[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that 
it would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer 
that was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any 
victims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad 
Edwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to 
address the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.357 
Sloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafaña to contact anyone about the plea 
hearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it.  Acosta told OPR that he 
believed the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal 
case “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”  
Nevertheless, Acosta did not know whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims 
or whether the USAO “shared that list with them.”  Villafaña told OPR that she and Acosta 
“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that 
the state only believed they had one victim.”358  Villafaña told OPR that there was “very little” 
communication between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, and although she discussed a 
factual proffer with the State Attorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had 
identified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they 
considered victims in the state case.”359 
Sloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results 
of this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.  He explained: 
[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the 
victims were going to be notified and the state was going . . . to 
fulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims] 
would be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set 
up on their behalf.   
Sloman acknowledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO 
from exercising its discretion to notify the victims,  
it was [of] concern that this was going to break down and . . . result 
in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be 
witnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, 
you’re going to get $150,000, that’s . . . going to be instant 
impeachment for the defense.  
357  
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case 
would not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings.  Rather, such a 
presentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office and additional 
investigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Attorney’s Office.      
358  
In an email a few months earlier, Villafaña noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution] 
is related to two girls.  One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”    
359  
As noted in Chapter Two, Villafaña had stopped communicating with the State Attorney’s Office regarding 
the state case following Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.   

234 
When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, 
Sloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.  I didn’t get the sense 
that the victims were overly interested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.”   
Also, in late June, Villafaña drafted a victim notification letter concerning the June 30, 
2008 plea.360  Villafaña told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2007 that we 
would not provide written notice of the state change of plea, the written victim notifications were 
prepared to be sent immediately following Epstein’s guilty plea.”361  As she did with prior draft 
victim notification letters, Villafaña provided the draft to the defense for comments.362   
Although Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 30, 2008, Villafaña took steps to facilitate 
the filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.  
OPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Attorney’s Office made 
available online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing 
date, the state informed victims of the June 30, 2008 plea.  On March 12, 2008, the State Attorney’s 
Office issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding 
the individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2008.  However, the Palm Beach 
County Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at] 
college.”       
XI. 
JUNE 30, 2008:  EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT 
HEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT 
On June 30, 2008, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his attorney 
Jack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under 18 
for prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution.  The 
information charged that between August 1, 2004, and October 9, 2005, Epstein “did knowingly 
and unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under 
the age of 18 years,” and referred to no other victims.  The indictment did not identify any victims 
and alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August 
1, 2004, and October 31, 2005.  Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to 
multiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed the court that 
“[t]here’s several” victims.  When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these 
cases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to 
several myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,  
360  
Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification letter to Acosta, who responded with his own edited version 
stating, “What do you think?”  Villafaña edited it further.     
361  
The letter began with the statement, “On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.”  A week 
after Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafaña notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local 
attorney] Jack Goldberger is back in town today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—
the victim list and Notification.  If I face resistance on that front, I will let you know.”    
362  
According to Villafaña, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications following the 
state plea and to share the draft notification letters with the defense.  

235 
yes.”  The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the 
plea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age 18, Belohlavek spoke 
with the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.363   
Both Villafaña and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the 
plea hearing.  Later that day, Villafaña met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 31 individuals 
the government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.   
In her 2015 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to attend 
that hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation 
of Epstein’s abuse of me.”  She stated that she “would have attended and tried to object to the 
judge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she known that the state plea “had some 
connection to blocking the prosecution of my case.”  Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 
stated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”   
An attorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had 
subpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 30, 2008, in 
order to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of 
one of his clients.  The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.364  Moreover, the 
attorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in 
the PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s attorneys in the state case (with the 
Assistant State Attorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 30, 2008 plea 
hearing from the State Attorney’s Office.365  Similarly, another of the victims the state had 
subpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her attorney that she received subpoenas from the 
State Attorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing.  Belohlavek 
told OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing, 
and she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically” 
been victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses.  On July 24, 2008, the 
State Attorney’s Office sent letters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2008 
(although the plea occurred on June 30, 2008) and listed Epstein’s sentence.  The letters did not 
mention the NPA or the federal investigation.

SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS 
A. 
Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaña Notifies Some 
Victims’ Attorneys 
Villafaña’s contemporaneous notes show that immediately after Epstein’s June 30, 2008 
guilty pleas, she attempted to reach by telephone five attorneys representing various victims in 
363  
Villafaña, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no 
information as to whether or how the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.    
364  
Villafaña did contact this attorney’s law partner later that day.   
365  
When interviewed by OPR in 2020, this same attorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite 
the fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state 
identified in the information charging Epstein. 

236 
civil suits that were pending against Epstein.366  Villafaña also emailed one of the pro bono 
attorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal 
investigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the 
USAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the 
victims.”  Villafaña advised Goldberger:  “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].  
I do not know whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under 
seal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.” 
B. 
July 7, 2008:  The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated 
On July 3, 2008, victims’ attorney Edwards spoke to Villafaña by telephone about the 
resolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”367  In 
his 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation, 
Villafaña did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was 
beginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.”  However, in an 
email Villafaña sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that 
“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to know if we can get out of the deal.”  
Villafaña told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the 
agreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of 
hesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be 
allowed to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”368   
That same day, Edwards wrote a letter to Villafaña, complaining that Epstein’s state court 
sentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafaña to “move 
forward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes 
Mr. Epstein has committed.”   
On July 7, 2008, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane 
Doe.”  She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane 
Doe 1” and “Jane Doe 2.”369  Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights 
under the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting 
with the victims.  The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the 
CVRA.  The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were 
366  
According to Villafaña’s handwritten notes from June 30, 2008, Villafaña left a message for two of the 
attorneys.  
367  
In his 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on 
June 30, 2008, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2008.  
368  
Sloman responded, “Thanks.”  
369  
Later attempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court. 

237 
no federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2007 to 
defer prosecution to the state.370  
C. 
July 2008:  Villafaña Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Letter to Listed 
Victims 
On July 8, 2008, Villafaña provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 30, 2008 
letter.  Villafaña also informed the defense that, beginning the following day, she would distribute 
notifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s attorney 
would be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages.  Finally, the 
letter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one 
of these victims is entitled to proceed under 18 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the 
terms of the NPA. 
After exchanging emails and letters with the defense concerning the content of the notice 
letter, Villafaña drafted a letter she sent, on July 9 and 10, to nine victims who had previously 
retained counsel.  The letter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of” Epstein’s 
June 30, 2008 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to 
engage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of 18 months’ imprisonment followed by 12 
months’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
this state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.”  The letter included a reference to the 
U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used 
language from Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein defense attorney Sanchez clarifying 
the damages provision.  The paragraph below was described as “[o]ne such condition to which 
Epstein has agreed”: 
Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an 
offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she 
would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense.  For purposes of implementing 
this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to 
name . . . as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.  Any 
judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority 
determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, 
shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these 
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.  
On July 10, 2008, Villafaña sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,” 
highlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to 
370  
As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the matter continued in litigation for years and resulted in the 
district court’s February 21, 2019 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA 
by failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.  

238 
U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to 
name as victims of an enumerated offense.” 371  The same day, Villafaña sent Goldberger a second 
letter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.   
Villafaña informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to 
the listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to 
confirm their addresses for notification by mail.  With regard to the content of the telephone calls, 
Villafaña proposed the following language to the case agents: 
We are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein 
investigation and to thank you for your help. 
Mr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him 
to register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of 18 
months imprisonment followed by one year of home confinement.  
Mr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of 
restitution.   
All of these terms are set out in a letter that AUSA Villafaña is going 
to send out.  Do you have a lawyer?  Get name or address.  If not[,] 
where do you want [the] letter sent?  If you have questions when 
you receive the letter, please understand that we cannot provide 
legal advice but the lawyers at the following victim rights 
organizations are able to help you at no cost to you.  (Provide names 
and phone numbers) 
Also ask about counseling and let them know that counseling is still 
available even though the investigation is closed.  
On July 21, 2008, Villafaña sent the letter to the 11 unrepresented victims whose addresses 
the FBI had by that time confirmed.  Villafaña provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of 
the letter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).   
D. 
July – August 2008:  The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Letter to Victims 
Residing Outside of the United States 
While attempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact 
information for two victims residing outside of the United States.  On July 23 and August 8, 2008, 
respectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmitted an automated VNS form notification letter to 
each victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country.  This 
371  
A month later, in an August 18, 2008 letter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim 
list to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2007 execution of the NPA.  Villafaña also raised 
with Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to 
include new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2008 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously 
given a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list.  Ultimately, Villafaña sent the defense a 
letter confirming that the government’s July 10, 2008 victim list was “the final list.”      

239 
letter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification letter the FBI had sent to 
victims (in 2006, 2007, and 2008) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a 
federal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.   
The letter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 30, 2008, or 
that the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state 
plea.  Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated letter, the letter requested the victims’ 
“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”  
For each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafaña also drafted a 
notification letter concerning the June 30, 2008 plea and the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were 
to be hand delivered along with the FBI’s letters.  However, FBI records do not reflect whether 
the USAO’s letter was delivered to the two victims.     
E. 
August – September 2008:  The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose 
the NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Letter  
On August 1, 2008, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to 
the NPA.  The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.372  
On August 21, 2008, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of 
the NPA subject to a protective order.  In addition, the court ordered the government to produce 
the NPA to other identified victims upon request: 
(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as 
victims of Epstein and/or any attorney(s) for those individuals 
request the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall 
produce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals 
also agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any 
third party absent further court order, following notice to and an 
opportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]373 
In September 2008, the USAO sent a revised notification letter to victims, and attorneys 
for represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not 
contest liability in victim civil suits brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.374  The September letter 
appeared to address concerns raised by Epstein attorney Lefkowitz that the government’s earlier 
notification letter referenced language concerning 18 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had 
proposed in Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein attorney Sanchez, but that the defense 
had not accepted.375  As a result of the defense objection, Villafaña determined that she was

Pursuant to paragraph 13 of the NPA, Villafaña made Epstein’s attorneys aware of the petitioners’ request 
for the NPA.

The USAO also sent a notification letter to additional victims who had not received a notification letter in 
July.

240 
obligated to amend her prior letter to victims to correct the reference to the December letter.376  
Accordingly, the September letter contained no information about the parties’ intent in 
implementing 18 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s 
waiver of his right to contest liability under the provision.  In addition, the September letter 
described the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an attorney to 
represent the victims in their 18 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement 
to pay the attorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation.  The letter also clarified that 
Epstein’s agreement to pay for attorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.   
The government also intended for the letter to comply with the court’s order concerning 
providing victims with copies of the NPA.  The initial draft included a paragraph advising the 
victims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:   
In addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make 
available to any designated victim (and/or her attorney) a copy of 
the actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so 
long as the victim (and/or her attorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to 
be bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court.  If [the victim] 
would like to review the Agreement, please let me know, and I will 
forward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.  
The government shared draft versions of the September letter with Epstein’s counsel and 
responded to criticism of the content of the proposed letter.  For example, in response to the above 
language regarding the August 21, 2008 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued 
that there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice 
that the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality 
provisions of the [NPA].”  In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafaña 
revised the paragraph as follows:  
In addition, there has been litigation between the United States and 
two other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement 
between the United States and Mr. Epstein.  [The attorney selected 
by the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or 
if you select another attorney to represent you, that attorney can 
review the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].   
On September 18, 2009, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been 
filed in the state case.377 
376  
In the letter, Villafaña expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December 19, 2007 
letter that was included in the July 2008 notification letter, noting that the July 2008 letter had been approved by 
defense counsel before being sent.

F. 
2010 – 2011:  Department and Congressional Actions Regarding 
Interpretation of the CVRA 
In connection with the Department’s 2010 effort to update its 2005 Guidelines, the Office 
of the Deputy Attorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to 
revisit its 2005 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA 
and solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement 
agencies.  In response, OLC issued a December 17, 2010 opinion entitled, The Availability of 
Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004.  Based on the CVRA’s 
language, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC 
reaffirmed its 2005 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed 
(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are 
dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal 
charges after the filing of a complaint).”378   
After OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2005 Guidelines in October 2011 
but did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal 
charges were filed.  The 2011 revision did, however, add language concerning victim consultation 
before a defendant is charged:  “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has 
been brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the 
filing of a charging instrument with the court.”379  The use of the word “should” in the 2011 
Guidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an 
appropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”380  Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be 
general in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”381  The revisions 
also specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea 
proceedings.382      
On November 2, 2011, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a letter to 
Attorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2011 Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite 
clearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2011 Guidelines did “not extend any rights 
to victims until charges have been filed.”  The Department’s response emphasized that the 
378  
OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a matter of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA 
rights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.   
379  
See 2011 Guidelines, Art. V, ¶ G.2, available at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/ 
ag_guidelines2012. pdf.   In its 2011 online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such 
consultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-
indictment plea negotiations.   
380  
See 2011 Guidelines, Art. I, ¶ B.2. 
381  
See 2011 Guidelines, Art. V, ¶ G.2. 
382  
The 2005 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to 
exercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing.  See 2005 Guidelines, Art. IV, 
¶ C.3.b.(2).  However, the 2005 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the 
CVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.  The 2011 revision 
remedied this omission. 

242 
Department had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to 
assert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.”  The response also referenced OLC’s December 
2010 opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting 
that “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make 
reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective 
plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”383 
In 2015, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the following two rights: 
(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain 
or deferred prosecution agreement.  
(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the 
services described in section 503(c) of the Victims’ Rights and 
Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10F DQG SURYLGHG FRQWDFW

G. 
The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status  
While the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous 
federal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge 
as “related cases,” as a matter of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules.  As the parties 
agreed on settlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.384  Several of the victims who had 
settled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their 
anonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.385    
In the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights 
to confer by (1) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending letters to the 
victims claiming that the matter was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and 
(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal 
investigation.  In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right 
to be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right 
to reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the 
NPA and resolved the federal investigation.     
During the litigation, the USAO argued that (1) the victims had no right to notice or 
conferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s 
383  
157 Cong. Rec. S7359-02 (2011) (Kyl letter and Department response). 
384  
Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well.  In addition, numerous 
other cases were resolved outside of formal litigation.  For example, one attorney told OPR that he resolved 16 victim 
cases, but did not file all cases with the court.  Court data indicate that the attorney filed only 3 of the 16 cases he said 
he resolved.

Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2015 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at 1 (July 24, 
2015). 

243 
letters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the matter was 
“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that 
Epstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafaña contacted the petitioners’ attorney prior to Epstein’s 
state plea to advise him of the hearing.  Nonetheless, Villafaña told OPR that, while there were 
valid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is 
a case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required.  I was obviously 
prepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].” 
Over the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the 
provisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “attach 
before the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.”  The court also held that 
(1) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a 
non-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the 
statute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”; 
(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal 
investigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes committed by Epstein render 
the Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable 
defense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”   
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial 
Summary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its 
intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.”  The government did not 
dispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court 
concluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners 
that it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.”  The court found that the post-
NPA letters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the 
victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material 
omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an 
investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”386  
The court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the 
government’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea 
agreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is 
entered into without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard 
regarding any aspect of the case.”  The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure 
to communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with 
Epstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with 
the Court.”     
Although the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2005 Guidelines for the 
Department’s position that CVRA rights do not attach until after a defendant is charged, the court 
was “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold 
information about the NPA from the victims.”  The court found that the government’s reliance on 
386  
The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of 
Epstein’s state court plea hearing.   

244 
the 2005 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with 
Epstein’s attorneys, in which the government acknowledged that “it had obligations to notify the 
victims.”  The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate 
remedies.  Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission 
of the NPA; a written apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta, 
Villafaña, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials; 
training for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and attorneys’ fees.387  
Following Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death 
while in custody, on September 16, 2019, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied 
the petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the 
most significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s 
violation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”388  The court did not 
order the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government 
will honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the 
proper treatment of crime victims.”389  The court also denied the petitioners’ request for attorneys’ 
fees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the 
merits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted 
legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”   
On September 30, 2019, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested 
remedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Eleventh Circuit.390  In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and 
“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”391  Nevertheless, the 
government argued that, “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because 
no criminal charges were brought.”392  The government conceded, however, that with regard to 
the New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein

that it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and 
to receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flow from the right to confer and were 
encompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”

Victims Rights Act at 14 (Oct. 31, 2019).  As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.   
392  
The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2015 to include a victim’s right to be 
notified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to 
non-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court 
involvement.

victims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal 
case, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.”  During oral 
argument on January 16, 2020, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:    
The issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with 
Ms. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA, 
and they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was 
ongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.  The government 
should have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way 
with Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.393 
On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied 
Wild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the 
commencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the 
petitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”394  The court conducted a thorough analysis 
of the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions.  The court 
distinguished In re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any 
analysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.”  The court noted that its 
interpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2010 OLC opinion concerning 
victim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”  
Finally, the court raised separation of powers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s) 
interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would 
interfere with prosecutorial discretion.    
Nevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying 
case, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding 
information it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from 
passive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”  The court concluded that 
although it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other 
victims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the 
government was obligated to do so.  In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly 
worded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the 
“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal 
restriction.”  
On May 5, 2020, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.  On August 7, 2020, the court 
granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this 
Report, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2020.

II. 
DEPARTMENT POLICY:  THE 2005 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR 
VICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2005 GUIDELINES) 
In 2005, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to 
incorporate the provisions of the CVRA.  The purpose of the 2005 Guidelines was “to establish 
guidelines to be followed by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative, 
prosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”    
The relevant portions of the 2005 Guidelines are as follows: 
Article IV:  Services to Victims and Witnesses 
A. Investigation Stage 
The investigative agency’s responsibilities begin with the report of the crime and extend 
through the prosecution of the case. In some instances, when explicitly stated, the 
investigative agency’s responsibility for a certain task is transferred to the prosecuting 
agency when charges are filed. 
. . . . 
2.  Identification of Victims. At the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at 
which it may be done without interfering with an investigation, the responsible official of 
the investigative agency shall identify the victims of the crime.  
3.  Description of Services. 
     a.  Information, Notice, and Referral 
(1)  Initial Information and Notice. Responsible officials must advise a victim 
pursuant to this section at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which 
it may be done without interfering with an investigation.  To comply with this 
requirement, it is recommended that victims be given a printed brochure or card 
that briefly describes their rights and the available services, identifies the local 

250 
service providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness 
coordinator or specialist and other key officials.  A victim must be informed of— 
(a)  His or her rights as enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  
(b)  His or her right entitlement, on request, to the services listed in 42 U.S.C. 
§ 10607(c).  
(c)  The name, title, business address, and telephone number of the responsible 
official to whom such a request for services should be addressed.  
(d)  The place where the victim may receive emergency medical or social 
services.  
(e)  The availability of any restitution or other relief (including crime victim 
compensation programs) to which the victim may be entitled under this or any 
other applicable law and the manner in which such relief may be obtained.  
(f)  Public and private programs that are available to provide counseling, 
treatment, and other support to the victim.  
. . . .  
(i)  The availability of services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, 
or stalking.  
(j)  The option of being included in VNS.  
(k)  Available protections from intimidation and harassment.  
. . . . 
(3) Notice during the investigation. During the investigation of a crime, a 
responsible official shall provide the victim with the earliest possible notice 
concerning— 
(a)  The status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent that it is 
appropriate and will not interfere with the investigation.  
(b)  The arrest of a suspected offender.  
B.  Prosecution Stage 
The prosecution stage begins when charges are filed and continues through postsentencing 
legal proceedings, including appeals and collateral attacks. 

251 
1.  Responsible Officials. For cases in which charges have been instituted, the responsible 
official is the U.S. Attorney in whose district the prosecution is pending.  
2.  Services to Crime Victims 
. . . . 
b.  Information, Notice, and Referrals 
(1)  Notice of Rights. Officers and employees of the Department of Justice shall 
make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of the rights enumerated 
in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  
(2)  Notice of Right To Seek Counsel. The prosecutor shall advise the crime victim 
that the crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights 
described in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  
(3)  Notice of Right To Attend Trial. The responsible official should inform the 
crime victim about the victim’s right to attend the trial regardless of whether the 
victim intends to make a statement or present any information about the effect of 
the crime on the victim during sentencing.  
(4)  Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, a responsible official 
shall provide the victim, using VNS (where appropriate), with reasonable notice 
of— 
(a)  The filing of charges against a suspected offender.  
(b)  The release or escape of an offender or suspected offender.  
(c)  The schedule of court proceedings. 
(i)  The responsible official shall provide the victim with reasonable, 
accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding or parole 
proceeding that involves the crime against the victim. In the event of an 
emergency or other last-minute hearing or change in the time or date of a 
hearing, the responsible official should consider providing notice by 
telephone or expedited means. This notification requirement relates to 
postsentencing proceedings as well.  
(ii)  The responsible official shall also give reasonable notice of the 
scheduling or rescheduling of any other court proceeding that the victim or 
witness is required or entitled to attend.  
(d)  The acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the rendering of 
a verdict after trial.  

252 
(e)  If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised 
release, if any, that are imposed.  
. . . . 
(6)  Referrals. Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim 
in contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief 
[previously identified]. 
c.  Consultation With a Government Attorney 
(1)  In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case.  The victim’s right to confer, however, shall not be 
construed to impair prosecutorial discretion.  Federal prosecutors should be 
available to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals, 
release of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for 
noninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion.  Because 
victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose 
whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations 
may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only 
nonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the 
prosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct. 
Representatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither 
the Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department 
may make on their behalf constitutes or creates an attorney-client relationship 
between such victims and the lawyers for the Government. 
Department personnel should not provide legal advice to victims. 
(2)  Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult 
with victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays 
in the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court 
of the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor. 
(3)  Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable 
efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, 
prospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible 
official should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving 
notice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not 
limited to, the following factors: 
(a)  The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety. 
(b)  The number of victims. 
(c)  Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea. 

253 
(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions. 
(e)  Whether there is another need for confidentiality. 
(f)  Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that 
relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial. 
III. 
FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT  
A. 
FRPC 4-4.1 – Candor in Dealing with Others 
FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact 
or law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.  A comment to this rule 
explains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or 
omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular 
statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.” 
B. 
FRPC 4-8.4 – Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice 
FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit, or misrepresentation.   
FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice 
of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.   
As previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct 
that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice 
of law.”  Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 41 So. 3d at 172.

CHAPTER THREE 
PART THREE:  ANALYSIS 
I. 
OVERVIEW 
In addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of 
the NPA, public and media attention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims.  In 
the CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not 
informed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the 
government did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of 
Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to attend; and 
actively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing.  The district 
court overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and 
that “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have 
patience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”395  
The government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that 
the prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from 
complaining publicly or in state court.   
OPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims, 
including the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision 
to defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision 
to delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 30, 2008.  
OPR considered whether letters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained 
false or misleading statements.  OPR also evaluated representations Villafaña made to victims in 
January and February 2008, and to an attorney for a victim in June 2008.   
II. 
THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS 
STANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE 
VICTIMS 
During the CVRA litigation, the government acknowledged that the USAO did not consult 
with victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA.  In its February 21, 2019 
opinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about 
its intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.”  OPR considered this 
finding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined 
whether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, federal prosecutors were obligated 
to consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject attorneys—Acosta, 
Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafaña—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that 
obligation.   
395  
Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1219, 1221 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 21, 2019). 

256 
As discussed below, OPR concludes that none of the subject attorneys violated a clear and 
unambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without 
a federal criminal charge.  In September 2007, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not 
interpret CVRA rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal 
courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal 
charges were brought.  Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find 
professional misconduct unless a subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and 
unambiguous standard.  Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject attorneys’ conduct did not rise to 
the level of professional misconduct.  OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation 
was part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court 
condemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as 
a whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and 
confusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”396  
A. 
At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to 
Notify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of 
Criminal Charges 
Although the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of 
whether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights attach was neither clear nor 
unambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2007.  At that 
time, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district 
court’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.  
The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a 
result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”  On April 
1, 2005, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ 
may be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the 
status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that 
directly caused the victim’s harm.”  Beginning with the 2005 OLC guidance, the Department has 
consistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal 
charges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information.  OLC applied its 
definition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2005, but noted that the obligation created by the 
eighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal 
officials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 [(VRRA)] indicates that this right 
applies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”397  Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in 
May 2005, the Department issued the 2005 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.   
The 2005 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the 
initiation of federal charges.  Specifically, the 2005 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution 
stage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, 
396  
2005 Guidelines, Foreword. 
397  
Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2005 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § 10606, 
had been repealed upon passage of the CVRA. 

257 
and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.398  The “prosecution stage” 
began when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.399     
At the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2007, few courts had addressed victim 
standing under the CVRA.  Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that 
standing attached only upon the filing of federal charges.400  Two cases relied upon by the court 
in its February 2019 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were 
decided after the NPA was signed.  
The CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this 
Report—show that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a matter 
of debate.401  In a November 21, 2019 letter to Attorney General William Barr, a Congressional 
Representative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that 
victims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key 
pre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”402  The CVRA 
litigation arising from the Epstein case shows the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights 
apply:  the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided 
panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has 
now been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.   
Because the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the 
lower courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA 
rights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims 
before signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA 
did not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of 
federal criminal charges.403

courts have discretion to take a more inclusive approach); and United States v. Guevara-Toloso, 2005 WL 1210982, 
at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 23, 2005) (order sua sponte) (in case involving a federal charge of illegal entry after a felony 
conviction, the court determined that victims of the predicate state conviction were not victims under the CVRA).

Violations of an unambiguous obligation concerning victims’ rights could result in a violation of the rules of 
professional responsibility.  For example, in Attorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, 109 A.3d 1184 (Md. 2015), the 
Court of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster 
family about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the matter 
was a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived 
the victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution.  The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional 

258 
In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language 
of the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge 
phase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its 
investigation of Epstein.  As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights 
and services; however, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court 
or by administrative complaint.  Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the 
victims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an attorney for 
the government.  However, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the 
CVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.  
The portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain 
victim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect following passage 
of the CVRA.  Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official 
to “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and 
another requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of 
the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and 
to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein 
investigation.  However, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part 
of the subject attorneys, as the 2005 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two 
requirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors.  Moreover, the VRRA did not 
require notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained 
“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under 
the NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2008.  Once Epstein did so, and the victims 
identified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the 
victims with appropriate notification.   
B. 
OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was 
Intended to Silence Victims 
During her OPR interviews, Villafaña recalled more than one discussion in which she 
raised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on 
September 24, 2007.  Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, however, had no recollection of 
discussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed 
Villafaña’s assertions.  OPR found only one written reference before that date, explicitly raising 
the issue of consultation.  Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to 
conclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision 
made by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about 
the NPA before it was signed.  Villafaña’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman 
may have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not 
believe that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations.  OPR 
Conduct 1.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.  The holding in Smith 
was based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among 
others, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or 
information filed in a circuit court.”  However, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts 
are substantially different from the Epstein investigation.  In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and 
charged before entering a plea.   

259 
did not find evidence showing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from 
having input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.    
Although the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification 
decisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, the records contain little about 
the subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed.  In a 
September 6, 2007 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning 
in earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafaña raised the topic of victim 
consultation with Sloman:  “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their 
approval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . . 
[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”404  
Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.”  Villafaña recalled that after she 
sent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that now.”405  Villafaña also told 
OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-
charge resolutions do not require victim notification.”  Villafaña also recalled a discussion with 
Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input 
on the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.  
You can’t disclose them.”406    
None of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about 
the USAO’s CVRA obligations.  Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to 
consult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of settlement negotiations; 
moreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.   
Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering 
into the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.”  Sloman 
believed the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we 
handled, filed cases.”  Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution 
of the matter, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the 
victims] prior to entering into . . . the NPA.”   
Lourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about 
the terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafaña that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.  
He stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the 
victims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that. . . . [I]f you 
look at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim 
this and that, you’re missing the big picture.”    
404  
As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims 
because no criminal charges had been filed.  In addition, Villafaña’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate 
because the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.   
405  
Villafaña did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.  
406  
Villafaña also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations 
could cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”  Villafaña was 
uncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2007.   

260 
Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was 
“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.”  Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’ 
views were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I 
was focused on at least at this time.”  Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored 
into the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknowledged 
to OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much better if we had 
[consulted with the victims].”407 
As indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect little about decisions made regarding 
victim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed.  Villafaña raised the issue in writing to her 
supervisors in early September, but there is no evidence showing whether her supervisors 
affirmatively rejected Villafaña’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims, 
ignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended 
uncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal.  OPR notes 
that its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the 
passage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed.  Although Villafaña 
recalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and 
Menchel contended that Villafaña’s recollection is inaccurate.  Assuming the discussions occurred, 
the timing is unclear.  Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafaña 
about victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely.  Any discussion involving Menchel 
necessarily occurred before August 3, 2007, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree 
to the government’s offer.  Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there 
was little to discuss with victims.   
To the extent that Villafaña’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult 
victims, Villafaña’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about 
the confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to 
consult with victims about a pre-charge disposition.  That belief accurately reflected the 
Department’s position at the time about application of the CVRA.  Importantly, OPR did not find 
evidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and 
Villafaña told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting 
to the agreement if they learned of it.  Because the subjects did not violate any clear and 
unambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR 
concludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct. 
However, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s 
treatment of the victims.  Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a 
more straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal 
to treat victims of crime with fairness and respect.  This was particularly important in a case in 
which victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process.  Furthermore, in this case, 
consulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into 
the victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.  The consultation provision does not

Villafaña told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order 
to . . . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”   

261 
require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allows victims the opportunity to express 
their views and to be heard before a final decision is made.  The lack of consultation in this case 
denied the victims that opportunity.408   
III. 
LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS 
BUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
After the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, Villafaña and the FBI separately 
communicated with numerous victims and victims’ attorneys, both in person and through letters.  
Apart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2007 about a 
resolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more 
generally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled 
guilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2008.  Despite the 
government’s agreement on September 24, 2007, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s 
compliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2007, January 2008, and 
May 2008, letters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.”  In its February 21, 
2019 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those letters “misl[ed] the victims to 
believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for 
the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about 
which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”409   
In the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of 
conduct with victims after the NPA was signed.  As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did 
not find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña acted with the intent to 
silence victims.  Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s 
interactions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning 
the federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.   
In this section, OPR examines and discusses letters sent to victims by the FBI that were the 
subject of the district court’s findings.  OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña 
was aware of the content of the letters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production 
for the CVRA litigation.  OPR determined that the January 10, 2008 and May 30, 2008 letters that 
the district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October 12, 2007 letter OPR located 
during its investigation, were “standard form letter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist.  As 
noted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the FBI agents continued 
to conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a 
408  
Villafaña told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was 
signed and “ask[ing] them how they wanted the case to be resolved.”  FBI interview reports indicate that Villafaña 
was present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations.  See 2005 
Guidelines, Art. IV, ¶ B.2.c (1) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying 
only nonsensitive data and public information).  However, Villafaña did not meet with all of the victims identified in 
the federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA 
litigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.  Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at 1218.

262 
breach, however, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.  
Thus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the 
omission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims 
of important information about the exact status of the investigation.   
A. 
The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Letters Sent by the 
FBI in October 2007, January 2008, and May 2008 Describing the Status of 
the Case as “Under Investigation”  
The 2005 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and 
available services during the “investigative stage” of a case.  During the Epstein investigation, the 
FBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets 
to victims following their interviews and through computer-generated letters sent to the victims by 
the FBI’s Victim Specialist.  The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s.  The 
USAO has its own Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim 
notification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”   
The FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2007, January 2008, and 
May 2008 letters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the 
2005 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative 
stage.”  The stock language of that letter, however, was generic and failed to communicate the 
unique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time.  The FBI Victim Specialist 
who sent the letters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the 
NPA at the time she created the letters.410  Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the letters sent 
by the FBI’s Victim Specialist.411  According to Villafaña, “The decision to issue the letters and 
the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.”  Although the FBI case agents 
informed Villafaña after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form letter,” 
Villafaña had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification letter and was not aware of its 
contents.412  Villafaña told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI letters until they were 
collected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2008.  
410  
The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a letter, 
but acknowledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”  
411  
The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the letters and believed them to be “standard form 
letters.”  Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go 
from the victim coordinator.”  
412  
Villafaña’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI letters led to some inconsistency in the 
information provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights.  Beginning in 2006, the FBI provided to victims 
standard letters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied 
pre-charge.  During this period, Villafaña also crafted her own introductory letters to the victims to let them know of 
their CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation 
in which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Attorney’s Office.”  Villafaña told 
OPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate 
questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.”  Villafaña’s letter itemized the CVRA 
rights, but it did not explain that those rights attached only after a formal charge had been made.  The letter was hand 

263 
B. 
Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the 
FBI Letters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the 
Status of the Federal Investigation 
As described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay 
entering his guilty plea, Villafaña and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to 
comply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein.  By April 
2008, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.”  As a result, 
Villafaña and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional 
investigative steps.  Among other actions, Villafaña, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents 
engaged in the following investigative activities:  
x The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2007 and between January and 
May 2008, and discovered at least six new victims.   
x In January 2008, CEOS assigned a Trial Attorney to bring expertise and “a national 
perspective” to the matter. 
x In January and February 2008, Villafaña and the CEOS Trial Attorney participated in 
victim interviews. 
x Villafaña revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknown to 
Epstein’s counsel.”   
x The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM 
[§] 8-3.120,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation matter” 
involving Epstein and others.  
x Villafaña secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being 
sought by Epstein’s attorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.413 
x Villafaña prepared a revised draft indictment. 
x Villafaña sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government 
witness in exchange for that witness’s testimony. 
x Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 30, 2008, Villafaña took steps to 
facilitate the filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead guilty. 
Villafaña told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim letter that the 
case was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.”  Similarly, the FBI case agent told 
OPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was 
delivered, along with the FBI’s own victim’s rights pamphlet and notification letter, to victims following their FBI 
interviews.   
413  
According to the 2017 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case attorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that 
Villafaña secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”   

264 
continuing.”  The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2019, 
the “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut down.”   
OPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim letters were drafted with the intent to mislead 
the victims about the status of the federal investigation.  The “ongoing investigation” language 
generated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical 
to that contained in standard form notification letters the FBI generated and distributed from 
August 2006 through the 2007 signing of the NPA.414  Nevertheless, the FBI’s letters omitted 
important information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a 
federal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an 
agreement he had reached with the USAO.  Victims receiving the FBI’s letter would logically 
conclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal 
prosecution.  CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of 
this letter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving 
forward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her.  Furthermore, when the 
fact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2007 eventually came 
to light, the statement in the subsequent letters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions 
that the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.   
In sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim letters that the matter was 
“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to 
investigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein.  The letters, however, risked misleading the 
victims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the letters did not provide 
important information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.  
Nonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafaña or her supervisors participated in drafting 
those letters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s letters until the Department gathered them 
for production in the CVRA litigation.  The use of FBI form letters that gave incomplete 
information about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the 
federal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of 
attention to and oversight regarding communication with victims.  Despite the fact that the case 
was no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form letters continued to be 
sent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information 
provided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.415          
414  
The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System 
indicates that letters the FBI system generated in 2006 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial 
(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and letters generated in 2008 contained stock language for the 
notification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.” 
415  
After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form letter requesting “assistance and 
cooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.

IV. 
ACOSTA’S 
DECISION 
TO 
DEFER 
TO 
THE 
STATE 
ATTORNEY’S 
DISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE 
COURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS 
STANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY 
FAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING 
As set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became 
clear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to 
inform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing.  The USAO initially 
took the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA, 
including the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that 
victims who wanted to attend could do so.   
In November and December 2007, Epstein’s attorneys challenged the USAO’s position 
regarding victim notification.  Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim 
notifications.  Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected 
to defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing 
pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights requirements.  Acosta also determined that the USAO 
would notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255, 
a decision that was implemented by letters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.  
This decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas, 
was based, at least in part, on Villafaña’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to 
preserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, below.   
In this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for 
notifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing.  OPR concludes that neither the CVRA 
nor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore 
Acosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State 
Attorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing.  However, OPR 
also concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state 
intended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims 
forthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department.  Through counsel, Acosta 
“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard 
“never before expected of any U.S. Attorney.”  OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the 
discussion below.   
A. 
Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Attorney’s Discretion Whether to 
Notify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any 
Clear or Unambiguous Standard 
In November 2007, Villafaña sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct 
concerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a written notice to victims informing 
them of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting 
them to appear at the state plea hearing.  Villafaña and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft letter 
and, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense attorney Lefkowitz, who, in turn, 

266 
strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he 
described as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified 
individuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”  
Thereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafaña 
drafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2007 letter to Lefkowitz rejecting the defense 
arguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in 
the federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing.  The letter took an expansive 
view of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the 
USAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings: 
[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district 
court.  Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal 
investigation by allowing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.  
The victims identified through the federal investigation should be 
appropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does 
not require the U.S. Attorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal 
obligations.416 
The letter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with 
information concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice 
of the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea.  Along with 
the letter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification letter to Lefkowitz for his 
comments.  This draft victim notification letter stated that the federal investigation had been 
completed, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend 18 months of 
imprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims 
brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The draft victim notification letter provided specific information 
concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to attend or provide a 
written statement to the State Attorney’s Office.  When Lefkowitz asked Sloman to delay sending 
victim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafaña, who was 
preparing letters for transmittal to 30 victims, to “Hold the letter.”  During his OPR interview, 
Sloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the letter out,” but he “must have had a conversation 
with somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed 
Villafaña to hold the letter.  
In his response letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz contended that the government had 
misinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in 
this matter [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”  
416  
Sloman told Lefkowitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the 
victims of their rights.”  Sloman also addressed the defense attorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could 
contact Villafaña or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal 
law requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in this case.’”   

267 
Thereafter, in his December 19, 2007 letter to defense counsel mainly addressing other 
matters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Attorney’s discretion 
the responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing: 
I understand that the defense objects to the victims being given 
notice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and] 
sentencing hearing.  I have reviewed the proposed victim 
notification letter and the statute.  I would note that the United States 
provided the draft letter to the defense as a courtesy.  In addition, 
First Assistant United States Attorney Sloman already incorporated 
in the letter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.  
I agree that Section 3771 applies to notice of proceedings and results 
of investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.  We 
intend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as 
required by law.  We will defer to the discretion of the State Attorney 
regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the 
state proceedings, although we will provide him with the 
information necessary to do so if he wishes.   
(Emphasis added.) 
Acosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [letter] without running it by [Sloman], 
if not other individuals in the office.”  Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State 
Attorney, or for our office to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to 
the state outcome.”  Acosta acknowledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s 
handling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever 
obligation they have.  Let’s not assume. . . that the State Attorney’s office is full of bad actors.” 
Sloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially 
because they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was 
an agreement made that we were going to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to 
decide how the victims were going to be notified.”417  Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding 
under the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal 
case,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if 
we g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . . . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be 
instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.” 
OPR could not determine whether the State Attorney’s Office notified any victims in 
advance of the June 30, 2008 state plea hearing.  Krischer told OPR that the State Attorney’s Office 
had a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether 
or how it was used in the Epstein case.  Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether 
victims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the 
417  
Sloman stated in his June 3, 2008 letter to Deputy Attorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision 
together with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker.  Acosta did consult 
with Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled 
discussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played 
a role in the deferral decision.

particular charges and victims at issue.  Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafaña to 
contact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2008, she reported back 
to Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”418  Villafaña recalled that she 
sent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said 
he would “contact as many as he could.”  The contemporaneous records do not show how many 
or which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom.  No victim 
who provided information to OPR, either in person or through her attorney, recalled receiving 
notice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials.  At the time Epstein pled guilty in state 
court, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Attorney’s Office had 
notified about the proceeding.  Accordingly, Villafaña, who was present in the courtroom for the 
hearing, had no knowledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims 
were “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”419   
OPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Attorney’s Office the 
decision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional 
misconduct.  OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring 
notice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled 
to attend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.  
Furthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not 
apply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.420  Moreover, the section of the VRRA 
requiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to attend” referred specifically to 
proceedings under 42 U.S.C. § 10606(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become 
part of the CVRA (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2)).421 
Because Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the 
federal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State 
Attorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing 
so did not constitute professional misconduct.422   
418  
Sloman replied, “Good.”  In her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated, “I requested permission to make 
oral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification 
could only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”

The government’s letter to victims, following Epstein’s guilty pleas, informing them of the resolution of the

B. 
Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims 
Identified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea 
Hearing  
Although Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the 
state’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that 
the federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state 
charges.  As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to 
interfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney.  His decision that the 
USAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Attorney’s 
judgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view.  However, OPR 
found no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State 
Attorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that 
the state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the 
victims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims 
that it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal 
investigation into their own cases.423 
Even taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to 
interfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem 
from passing the task of notifying victims to the State Attorney’s Office and made appropriate 
efforts to ensure that those problems were minimized.  Appropriate notification would have 
included advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to 
bring charges and that the matter was being handled by the State Attorney, and, at a minimum, 
provided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information.  Acosta could have interacted with 
the State Attorney, or instructed Villafaña or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make 
notifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information 
necessary to accomplish the task.  Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification 
entirely to the State Attorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of 
individuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state 
prosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.   
Epstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming 
that each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge 
involved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state 
offenses.  Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining 
whether the state intended to notify more than those few victims.  Moreover, the federal 
investigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by 
inform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.”  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 10607(c)(1)(B) 
and (c)(3)(A).   
423  
Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification 
obligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation 
exists, it cannot be deferred.”  OPR’s criticism, as explained further below, is not with the decision itself, but rather 
with the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed 
that they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without 
ensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.

the PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct.  Absent information from the USAO, 
the state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea 
proceeding, even if the State Attorney had decided to include other victims identified during the 
state investigation.  Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised 
by Villafaña that Belohlavek, in November 2007, had requested that the USAO notify victims, 
presumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing. 
Acosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the 
victims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak.  Acosta 
also told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-
encompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was 
not proceeding.”  There is no evidence, however, that he verified this understanding with Sloman 
or Villafaña, let alone the State Attorney.  OPR found no indication that Acosta ever 
communicated, or directed Sloman or Villafaña to communicate, his decision to the State Attorney 
or to provide the State Attorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the 
federal investigation.  OPR located a draft letter to the State Attorney’s Office that Villafaña 
prepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2007, which did provide such information, but 
OPR found no evidence that the letter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly 
released from the State Attorney’s Office.424  OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and 
Villafaña interacted with the State Attorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 30, 2008 
plea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that 
office, and Villafaña’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that 
the USAO had not coordinated with the State Attorney’s Office.  Belohlavek told OPR that no one 
from the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to 
appear at the hearing.    
Krischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it 
to them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding.  In the absence of some 
discussion of which or how many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to 
tell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea 
hearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.  
In other words, Acosta failed to plan for how all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both 
federal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an 
opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” 
OPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the 
plea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately 
was not unsupported.  State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the 
Florida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources, 
and processes to help accomplish notification.  However, Acosta was aware—through the 
prosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafaña—that the 
USAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD 
424  
The text of the letter indicated that Epstein’s attorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights 
they may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Attorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the 
State Attorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with 
any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”   

271 
investigation.  Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than 
the total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO 
was certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to 
Acosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, there 
was a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not 
receive notice of the hearing.425  Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims 
could only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and 
the state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant 
issues relating to Epstein.  Villafaña and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the 
notification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played little role in complying with the state’s 
victim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning 
and coordination with the State Attorney’s Office.426   
Even if the State Attorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming 
plea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that 
the state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation 
as well.  The State Attorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status 
of the federal investigation, and there was little reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff, 
would voluntarily do so, thereby putting the State Attorney’s Office in the position of fielding 
victim questions and concerns about the outcome.  Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense 
had differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no 
indication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they 
could actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged 
crimes.427  
Through counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafaña and Sloman both told 
OPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason 
why Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.”  Acosta’s counsel further 
425  
 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state 
investigation.  Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear.  The PBPD’s 
probable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the 19 identified in the state 
investigation.  According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims.  After 
Epstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification letters to only 2 victims.  Belohlavek told OPR that because of the 
nature of the charges, she did not know whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required 
to notify of the plea hearing.   
426  
 The State Attorney’s Office had its own procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and 
Belohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim 
notification process.   
427  
Although Villafaña’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 960.001 and 921.143 when she 
drafted unsent letters to victims in November and December 2007 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing 
pursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been allowed to participate in 
the state plea hearing.  In Lefkowitz’s November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right 
to speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant 
was being sentenced.  In April 2008, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that 
Florida Statute § 921.143(l) did not allow the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing.  The court 
ruled that § 921.143(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.720(b) allows trial courts to consider at 
sentencing hearings.”  Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008).   

272 
argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification 
task, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the 
victims of the hearing.428  Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management 
played no role in the victim notification process; however, in this case, the issue of victim 
notification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the 
defense.  Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense 
counsel in his December 19, 2007 letter.  Villafaña provided Acosta with a draft letter to state 
officials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified 
in the federal investigation.  OPR found no evidence, however, that Acosta sent the letter or any 
similar communication to the State Attorney’s Office or that he provided Villafaña and Sloman 
with instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December 19, 
2007 letter.  Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to 
ensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the 
state process.             
Many victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a letter 
from the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some 
victims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media.  In the end, 
although Villafaña and Sloman hastily attempted to ensure victim notification through Chief 
Reiter, their effort was too little and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to attend 
the plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their own cases.429  
Although Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for 
notifying victims to the State Attorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.  
OPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta 
personally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the 
federal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.  
Acosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe 
the CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware 
of the state court proceeding.  Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s 
conduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been 
consistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity, 
and sensitivity.  Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the 
428  
As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of 
poor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before 
expected of any US Attorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State 
Attorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had 
actually notified the victims.  For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain 
specific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted 
responsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider how or even whether that entity would be able 
to accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.      
429  
OPR notes that Villafaña contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting 
window of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short.  Had the USAO coordinated with the State Attorney 
at some point in time closer to Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that 
the State Attorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and 
that issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.  
Similarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the 
months that the matter was under review by the Department.   

273 
resolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to attend the plea 
hearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast 
with Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s attorneys, which included the unusual 
courtesy of allowing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications.  This 
contrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the 
public.   
Nothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of 
determining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that 
all of the known federal victims received information about the state plea hearing.  Instead, as with 
his decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised 
poor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims, 
but also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to 
implement them.  Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility 
for making notifications entirely to the State Attorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO 
and the Department as a whole.  It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that 
resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with 
victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally 
sought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state 
proceeding.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to attend a hearing 
that was related to their own cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with 
forthrightness and dignity.  
V. 
VILLAFAÑA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER 
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN 
WHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID 
NOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS 
From September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 30, 2008 
state court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafaña’s direction, directly informed only three 
victims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the 
federal investigation would be closed.  During this time period, Villafaña and the case agents 
interacted with several victims and their attorneys, and Villafaña contacted victims’ attorney 
Bradley Edwards to encourage him to attend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform 
victims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.    
As described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and 
co-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.430  After speaking to three victims, however, 
the FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary 
damages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent 
should Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial.  As the case agent 
told OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue 
Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.”  The case 
430  
Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to 
Villafaña from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that 
she was unhappy with the resolution.    

274 
agent and Villafaña consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the 
matter, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue 
monetary damages according to its terms.  
Villafaña advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment 
evidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] now, cross-
examination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are 
entitled to a large amount of damages right?’”  Explaining the decision in her later CVRA 
declaration, Villafaña said that after Epstein’s attorneys “complained that the victims were 
receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their 
damages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the 
witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.”  Acosta was aware of these 
concerns as he referred to them in an August 2008 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the 
victims would compromise them as potential witnesses.  Epstein argued very forcefully that they 
were doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a] 
key part of [the] agree[ment].”   
The case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2007, but did not inform 
them about the NPA.431  On January 31, 2008, the FBI agents, Villafaña, and the CEOS Trial 
Attorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one 
more victim the next day.432  Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of 
2007 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.   
Villafaña told OPR that during the January 31, 2008 interviews, she did not specifically 
tell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.”  She 
stated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand 
what that means.”  Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafaña, had been 
informed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where 
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually 
perform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”  
Villafaña recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court” 
that would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal 
investigation versus a state investigation.”  Villafaña told OPR she explained “the case was under 
investigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that 
charges would be brought.”  An email from Villafaña to Sloman and Acosta during this time period 
reflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date:  “The 
second girl . . . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had read about in the paper. . . .  
[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.”  Villafaña, 
however, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather, 
she likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.  In her own 2015 CVRA- 
case declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of 
431  
FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2008, without prosecutors, and did not inform the 
victims of the NPA.  
432  
Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, but the evidence is unclear as 
to whether the interviews occurred.   

275 
the federal investigation I was cooperating in.  If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have 
objected.”  Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me, 
I thought they were still investigating my case.”    
Neither the CEOS Trial Attorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim 
interviews.  The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited 
from the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of 
the case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.433   
When asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when 
she was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafaña told OPR that 
she believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued 
“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.  
As Villafaña stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is now back under investigation is 
perfectly accurate.” 
Villafaña was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with 
civil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ attorneys about the NPA.  
In a 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ attorney Bradley Edwards alleged that 
during telephone calls with Villafaña, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the 
investigation was in,” and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because the 
matter “was an on-going active investigation.”  Edwards stated that Villafaña gave him “the 
impression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, 
both in the number of identified victims and complexity.”  Edwards also stated, “A fair 
characterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafaña 
listened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”   
In her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke” 
during her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the 
possibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”  
Villafaña also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been 
given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any 
involvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information 
to Edwards. 
 Sloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO 
from exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to 
break down and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses 
and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $150,000, that’s . . . 
going to be instant impeachment for the defense.”434  Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did 
433  
As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to 
be prosecuted.  
434  
When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman 
responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.  I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly 
interested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.”  

276 
not plead guilty in October 2007 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether 
the case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here 
has to be discretion to judge how much you can tell the victims and when.”   
Epstein’s attorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and 
Epstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafaña all 
identified.  As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and 
civil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against 
Epstein by the government’s promises of financial gain.  For example, during a February 20, 2008 
state deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI 
agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.435  In her 2017 declaration in 
the CVRA litigation, Villafaña identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the 
government’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
recovery.    
On June 27, 2008, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 30, 2008 state court guilty 
plea hearing, Villafaña contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.  Villafaña 
told OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s attorney other than Edwards 
about the scheduled state plea hearing.436  In his 2017 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation, 
Edwards stated that Villafaña “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that 
Epstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”   
Edwards said in a 2016 court filing that Villafaña told him only that “Epstein was pleading 
guilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s 
clients nor any of the federally-identified victims.”  Villafaña stated in her 2017 declaration that 
she “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the 
state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution 
charge to a specific victim.”  Villafaña told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his 
clients to attend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized 
by the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.”  In his 2017 affidavit, Edwards acknowledged 
that “Villafaña did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that 
way.”  Edwards claimed that Villafaña’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court 
would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement” 
resulted in his clients not attending the hearing.  Edwards himself was out of town and not able to 
435  
As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn 
information concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state 
prosecution.  For example, in a March 2008 email, Villafaña informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who 
had received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you know, doesn’t involve most 
of the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).”  Villafaña further observed that because Epstein 
is “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim] 
seems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”      
436  
Villafaña’s June 30, 2008 handwritten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea, 
Villafaña was aware of the identities of a least five other attorneys representing Epstein’s victims.  In her written 
response to OPR, Villafaña stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the 
upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator, 
and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”  On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman to inform 
him that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”  Sloman replied, “Good.”   

277 
attend the hearing.  In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have 
believed that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that 
federal investigation.”      
In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to 
Epstein’s attorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the 
January and May 2008 FBI letters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive 
nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”437  Although both the appellate 
court and district court focused on the FBI’s letters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafaña, 
Sloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether 
similar representations Villafaña made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 31 and 
February 1, 2008, and to Edwards, were misleading.  Therefore, OPR considered whether 
Villafaña’s statements that the matter was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the 
victims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.1(a), 4-8.4(c), or 
4-8.4(d). 
FRPC 4-4.1(a) prohibits an attorney from “knowingly mak[ing] a false statement of 
material fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client.  The FRPC defines 
“knowingly” as “denot[ing] actual knowledge of the fact in question” and states that such 
knowledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”438  The comment to FRPC 4-4.1 states that 
“[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that 
are the equivalent of affirmative false statements.”  The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[f]or 
dishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.”  Like FRPC 4-4.1(a), Rule 4-8.4(c) 
requires evidence that the attorney knew the statement in question was false.  Under FRPC 
4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by showing that the conduct was 
deliberate or knowing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative; 
instead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”439  In Feinberg, the court concluded that 
the prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.1 and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful 
statements to a defense attorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the 
defendant by making the statements.440  In this case, Villafaña was fully aware of the signed NPA 
when she interviewed the victims on January 31 and February 1, 2008, and when she spoke to 
Edwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA.  The 
question is whether this omission amounted to a knowing false statement or misrepresentation. 
One difficulty is determining what Villafaña actually said during conversations that 
participants were asked to recall many years later.  With respect to three of the victims whom she 
interviewed in January and February 2008, Villafaña contended that she discussed the agreement 
with them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as 
437

278 
previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion.  Villafaña’s 
mention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to 
apprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.   
Nevertheless, Villafaña did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms 
with other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s 
attorney.  OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of 
the NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC 
4-4.1 or 4-8.4.441   
OPR evaluated Villafaña’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.1:   
A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a 
client’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an 
opposing party of relevant facts.  A misrepresentation can occur if 
the lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that 
the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by 
partially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the 
equivalent of affirmative false statements.   
The victims and their attorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the 
comment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third 
parties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.   
Here, the evidence does not show that Villafaña knowingly made an affirmative false 
statement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false 
statements” about material facts.  First, Villafaña told OPR that she believed the investigation was 
ongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the 
evidence shows that Villafaña and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein 
entered his guilty plea in state court in June 2008.  Villafaña’s email correspondence with her 
supervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to 
charge him.  The evidence similarly does not show that Villafaña knowingly made any affirmative 
false statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined 
to provide additional information in response to his questions.442    
Second, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafaña 
interacted with the victims and Edwards.  Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what 
information will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons.  In 
many cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses, 
441  
In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.1(a) and 4-8.4(c) 
“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].”  Florida Bar v. Joy, 
679 So. 2d 1165, 1166-68 (Fla. 1996).  See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 816 (Fla. 1994) (petition for 
reinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).    
442  
In Feinberg, 760 So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Attorney lacked candor and violated 
ethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his attorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the 
defense attorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.   

279 
and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with 
victims.  The 2005 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited 
in their disclosures:  “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, 
and may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations 
may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and 
public information.”443   
Villafaña’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing 
victims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.  
Indeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem, 
Villafaña agreed with the agents’ concerns.  Villafaña raised those concerns with the USAO’s 
Professional Responsibility Officer in October 2007 after the agents brought the issue to her 
attention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom 
advised her that those concerns were improper or unsound.  OPR also considered that although 
Villafaña had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her 
supervisor, the U.S. Attorney, had decided otherwise.  When authorized to inform Edwards of the 
scheduled change of plea hearing, she did so.  Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea 
was part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not show 
that Villafaña acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from attending the 
hearing.  Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to 
inform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from attending the state proceedings.  
Rather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafaña told him the hearing was “important.”  Villafaña sought 
to strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) attendance at the state court 
plea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the 
federal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.  
Therefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the 
evidence does not establish that Villafaña violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.1 or 4-8.4(c) 
or (d).444  Nonetheless, as discussed below, Villafaña’s interactions with victims and victims’ 
attorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal 
investigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was 
443  
2005 Guidelines, Art. IV, ¶ B.2.c(1).  As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein 
during interviews with the government and they, or their attorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about 
the government’s communications.  For example, within a day of Villafaña contacting a victim’s attorney about a 
potential victim notification letter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately 
provided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl’s attorney, even though it was clear from the 
girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.” 
444  
The case most directly on point is Smith, 109 A.3d 1184, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed 
a violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the 
resolution of a sex abuse case.  However, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and 
charged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an 
opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.”  In this case, 
for the reasons previously discussed, Villafaña did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims 
or Edwards of the NPA.      

280 
intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with 
victims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.445   
VI. 
THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND 
WITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS 
WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION   
Although OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects committed professional 
misconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in 
interactions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of 
action.  The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims, 
particularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully attempted to 
join in the CVRA litigation.  As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the matter is 
that the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s attorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims.  It 
is unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after 
Menchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim 
notification letters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the 
requirements of the CVRA or the 2005 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was 
signed.  This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2005 Guidelines, that 
Department employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime 
endure in its wake.”  When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by 
the Department. 
Wild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar 
to and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and 
that demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government.  Wild experienced 
a series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafaña and the 
case agents.  Wild received Villafaña’s letter in June 2007 stating inaccurately that she was a 
federal victim entitled to CVRA rights.  She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2007 but was 
not told that a potential outcome was a state plea.  Shortly after the September 24, 2007 signing of 
the NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case.  Nonetheless, 
on January 10, 2008, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights letter indicating that the case was under 
investigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was 
charged.  On January 31, 2008, Villafaña re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS attorney and 
the FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention 
the NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution.  In mid-June 2008, when 
Edwards contacted Villafaña on Wild’s behalf, Villafaña informed him that the case was under 
investigation but did not mention the NPA.  Just before Epstein’s June 30, 2008 state court plea, 
445  
OPR notes that, similar to Villafaña, Sloman interacted with a victim’s attorney during the time period 
between the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea.  In January 2008, Sloman received a telephone call 
from his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal 
government could bring charges against Epstein.  Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest 
allegations due to his prior business relations with the attorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.  
Because Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the attorney.     

281 
Villafaña informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the 
state pleas would resolve the federal investigation.  Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and 
learned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had 
concluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas.  Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge 
permitted it in August 2008 pursuant to a protective order.  After considering this series of 
interactions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and 
believing she had been misled.   
OPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafaña, Acosta, Sloman, 
Menchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the 
NPA from public scrutiny.  Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion 
of CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knowing that victim consultation 
was not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to 
the point when he left the USAO.  The evidence is clear that Villafaña sought at various points to 
consult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the 
NPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address 
the issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her own concern about creating possible 
impeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.    
Nonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and 
after the signing of the NPA, would have been the better practice.  Before the NPA was signed, 
victims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was 
contemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being 
considered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share 
their views of how the case should be resolved.  Even if the USAO ultimately determined to 
proceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and 
concerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the 
process.  OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or 
considered before the NPA was signed.    
After the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the 
majority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.  
Although the evidence supports Villafaña’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that 
Epstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA 
was divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider how the 
desire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of 
the openness and fairness of the process.  As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed 
she had been “mistreated in the process.”  When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to 
avoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafaña, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have 
carefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did 
they revisit the decision before Villafaña met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or 
spoke to Edwards or other attorneys representing victims.446  Furthermore, more attention needed 
446  
It is not at all clear whether a court would have permitted impeachment of the victims concerning one 
provision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f) (“The 
admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of 
Evidence 410.”).  In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining 
monetary damages through either a civil suit or through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 (if Epstein were convicted after a trial), 

282 
to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and 
timely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s 
communications with victims.447   
The decision not to inform victims and their attorneys about the existence of the NPA gave 
victims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel 
to keep the agreement secret from the victims.  Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA 
gave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the matter and 
undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement.  The overall result of 
the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and 
frustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.  
Although OPR credits Villafaña’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in 
dealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not 
prioritized by the USAO.  In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally 
handled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with 
victims and other witnesses.  However, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafaña also 
contributed to the problems.  The government, as it ultimately acknowledged in the CVRA 
litigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified 
fashion.         
OPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the 
CVRA.  In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar 
with its provisions.  OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above 
into account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to 
ensure that in the future, Department attorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever 
possible.448  For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO 
for communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO 
failed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving 
inconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.  In certain cases, such as the 
Epstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department 
components are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory 
messages.   
independent of the NPA provision.  OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have 
permitted the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement.  In other words, 
while the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the 
case agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to 
significantly damage the credibility of the victims was low.     
447  
In addition to the FBI letters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can 
be seen in letters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.  
Although OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the letters, it appears from the records 
OPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI letter stating that the case was under 
investigation while also providing them with a USAO letter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s 
state guilty plea. 
448  
OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2011 Guidelines.     

283 
CONCLUSION 
In November 2018, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about 
state and federal criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that 
Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States 
and foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm 
Beach, Florida estate.  The Miami Herald reported that in 2007, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that 
permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by 
pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s 
co-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.   
Following the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to 
investigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO 
improperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by 
negotiating and executing the NPA.  OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations 
stemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and 
law enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims.  In July 2008, a victim, later joined 
by a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition 
for enforcement of her rights under the CVRA.  In February 2019, the district court found that the 
government violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the 
NPA.  The court also found that letters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed, 
describing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components.  The records 
included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected and reviewed 
materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings, 
grand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available 
information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media 
reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case.  OPR conducted 
more than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI 
administrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former 
Department attorneys and senior managers; and the former State Attorney and Assistant State 
Attorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed or received written 
information from several victims and attorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and federal law enforcement.   
OPR identified the following five former USAO attorneys as subjects of its investigation 
based on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case 
through the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement:  former U.S. Attorney 
R. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Matthew I. Menchel, Andrew C. 
Lourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafaña.  Each subject submitted written responses detailing their 
involvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and 
decisions relating to victim notification and consultation.  OPR conducted extensive interviews of 
all five subjects.  The subjects also submitted comments on OPR’s draft report.  

284 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various 
decisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework.  OPR 
found that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through 
a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that 
set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA.  Although Acosta did 
not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knowledge of its terms.  
Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other 
subjects who implemented his decisions.  
Based on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit 
professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.  
Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject attorney 
intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at 
issue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on 
federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.  Furthermore, none 
of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.  
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.  Acosta’s decision to decline to 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not 
find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations.  Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one 
of Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution.  Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.  Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances.  In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism 

285 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims.  The subjects did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into 
the NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation 
without a federal criminal charge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department 
did not interpret CVRA rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the 
federal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before 
criminal charges were brought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation 
was for the purpose of silencing victims.  Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series 
of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of 
the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is 
contradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims 
of a crime endure.  
 OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.  
Moreover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims.     
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights 
requirements.  Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.  

286 
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims’ attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct.  
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims.  Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      
After examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The 
overall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes 
that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.

METHODOLOGY 
A. 
Document Review 
As referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of 
thousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
Florida (USAO), other U.S. Attorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components, 
including the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive 
Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA).  The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their 
sources, are set forth below. 
1. 
USAO Records 
The USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein 
investigation and the CVRA litigation.  The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of 
material that Villafaña updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained 
pleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive 
compilations of internal and external correspondence, including letters and emails; evidence such 
as telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other 
confidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team 
handwritten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA, 
prosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.   
The USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material 
in the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set 
of Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein 
case collected by Sloman; Villafaña’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently 
retained official U.S. Attorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.   
2. 
EOUSA Records 
EOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional 
witnesses.  This information, dating back to 2005, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and 
saved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained.  EOUSA provided OPR with over 850,000 
Outlook records in total (not including email attachments or excluding duplicate records).  OPR 
identified key time periods and fully reviewed those records.  OPR applied search terms to the 
remainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.   
After reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records:  his inbox 
contained no emails from May 26, 2007, through November 2, 2008.  This gap, however, was not 
present with respect to Acosta’s sent email.  OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.  During its 
investigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data 
with an unrelated employee who had a similar name.  Once the data was properly associated, 
EOUSA found and produced 11,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2008, through the end of his 
tenure at the USAO.  However, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the 
emails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2008 and 2009, Outlook data for all U.S. 

288 
Attorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.  The USAO’s 
data was migrated between March and June 2008.    
EOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any 
additional emails.  OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the 
email gap.  Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knowledge of the problem, or that they or, 
to their knowledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails.  In addition, at 
OPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Attorney’s 
Offices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S. 
Attorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office.  OPR found no evidence 
indicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of 
concealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the 
result of a technological error.   
Although a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2007, through April 2, 2008, 
remained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this 
time due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email, 
which did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and 
witnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.   
3. 
Federal Bureau of Investigation Records 
OPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the 
Victim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein matter, to obtain relevant FBI documents.  
In addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation 
concerning its victim notification system.   
4. 
Criminal Division Records 
The Office of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with 
Outlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the 
USAO’s Epstein investigation.  The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, 
and saved emails, and calendar entries.   
CEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who 
worked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation.  The data included 
the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails.  CEOS also conducted a check of 
its shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.  
5. 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General Records  
OPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy 
Attorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the 
former Deputy Attorney General.  The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, 
and saved emails, and calendar entries. 

289 
6. 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records 
related to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence, 
when the Department recused the USAO in August 2011 from “all matters, to include the 
investigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with 
minor females,” and assigned the matter to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for further consideration.  The records included a declination of the matter due to the NPA.  
7. 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records 
related to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.   
8. 
Public Records 
OPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records 
of the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Attorney’s Office for the 15th Judicial Circuit, 
and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court 
proceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.    
B. 
Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims 
1. 
Subjects 
OPR requested that all five subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement 
in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions 
relating to victim notification and consultation.  In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews 
of each subject under oath and before a court reporter.  Each subject was represented by counsel 
and had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.  The 
subjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.   
2. 
Witnesses 
OPR conducted more than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their 
supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel.  OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff 
and attorneys and current and former Department attorneys and senior managers, including former 
Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division Alice Fisher.  OPR also interviewed former State Attorney Barry Krischer and former 
Assistant State Attorney Lanna Behlolovick.   
3. 
Communications with Victims and Victims’ Attorneys  
OPR contacted attorneys known to represent 26 victims among the 30 surviving individuals 
who were identified in the USAO’s July 2008 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to 
include in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the 
U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.  OPR contacted the attorneys to invite 

290 
the victims to provide OPR with information regarding their contacts with, and notification 
received from, the FBI and USAO, during the period before the NPA was signed or before 
Epstein’s state plea hearing, about the status of the federal investigation, about Epstein’s state plea, 
or about the NPA.  OPR received information from or pertaining to 13 victims.

Sections 1591(a)(1) and 2; and
IT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted responsibility for his behavior by his 

3DJH 2 RI 4 
signature on this Agreement; and 
IT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that 
the interest of the United States and Epstein’s own interest and the interest of justice will be 
served by the following procedure;  
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred in 
favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set out below.  
Should Epstein violate any of the conditions of this Agreement, the United States 
Attorney may at any time initiate prosecution against Epstein for any offense.  In this case, the 
United States Attorney will furnish Epstein with notice specifying the conditions of the 
Agreement which he has violated.  
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no prosecution for 
the offenses set out on page 1 of this Agreement will be instituted in this District, and the 
charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.  
Neither this Agreement nor any other document filed with the United States Attorney as 
part of this Agreement will be used against Epstein, except for impeachment purposes, in 
connection with any prosecution for the above-described offenses.  
Terms of the Agreement: 
1.
Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by
the State Attorney’s Office for the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm
Beach County (hereinafter, the “State Attorney’s Office”) charging
violations of the following Florida Statutes:
(a)
lewd and lascivious battery on a child, in violation of Fl. Stat.

2.
Epstein and the State Attorney’s Office shall make a joint, binding
recommendation that Epstein serve at least two years in prison, without
any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing; and without
probation or community control in lieu of imprisonment.

3DJH 3 RI 4 
3.
Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State
Attorney’s Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and
sentence.
4.
Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal
investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not
contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein will not
contest that the identified victims are persons who, while minors, were
victims of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422
and/or 2423.
5.
The United States shall provide Epstein’s attorneys with a list of the
identified victims, which will not exceed forty, after Epstein has signed
this agreement and entered his guilty plea.  The United States shall make
a motion with the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida for the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the identified
victims and Epstein’s counsel may contact the identified victims through
that counsel.
6.
Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and be sentenced not later than
September 28, 2007, and shall begin service of his sentence not later than
October 15, 2007.
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is 
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach of 
any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement and to 
investigate and prosecute Epstein for any and all federal offenses. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that 
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.  Epstein further is 
aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court may 
dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting a charge to 
the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial.  Epstein hereby 
requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such 
prosecution.  Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to the 
date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be deemed 
to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such prosecution 
on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to a 
speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute of limitations for a 
period of months equal to the period between the signing of this agreement and the breach of this 

3DJH 4 RI 4 
agreement.  Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the Fifth Amendment 
and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that all felonies must be charged 
in an indictment presented to a grand jury.  Epstein hereby agrees and consents that, if a 
prosecution against him is instituted, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed by the 
United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and 
explained to him.  Epstein hereby states that he understands the conditions of this 
non-Prosecution Agreement and agrees to comply with them.

for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have 
been the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury 
investigation will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be 
dismissed. 
Page 2 of 7 

Terms of the Agreement: 
1. 
Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to the Indictment as 
currently pending against him in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for 
Palm Beach County (Case No. 2006-cf-009495AXXXMB) charging 
one (1) count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Fl. Stat. § 
796.07. In addition, Epstein shall plead guilty to an Information filed 
by the State Attorney's Office charging Epstein with an offense that 
requires him to register as a sex offender, that is, the solicitation of 
minors to engage in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes Section 
796.03; 
2. 
Epstein shall make a binding recommendation that the Court impose a 
thirty (30) month sentence to be divided as follows: 
(a) 
Epstein shall be sentenced to consecutive terms of twelve (12) 
months and six (6) months in county jail for all charges, without 
any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, and 
without probation or community control in lieu of 
imprisonment; and 
(b) 
Epstein shall be sentenced to a term of twelve (12) months of 
community control consecutive to his two terms in county jail 
as described in Term 2(a), supra. 
3. 
This agreement is contingent upon a Judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit 
accepting and executing the sentence agreed upon between the State 
Attorney's Office and Epstein, the details of which are set forth in this 
agreement. 
4. 
The terms contained in paragraphs 1 and 2, supra, do not foreclose 
Epstein and the State Attorney's Office from agreeing to recommend 
any additional charge(s) or any additional term(s) of probation and/or 
incarceration. 
5. 
Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State 
Attorney's Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and 
sentence, except a sentence that exceeds what is set forth in paragraph 
(2), supra. 
6. 
Epstein shall provide to the U.S. Attorney's Office copies of all 
Page 3 of 7 

proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office prior to entering 
into those agreements. 
7. 
The United States shall provide Epstein's attorneys with a list of 
individuals whom it has identified as victims, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, after Epstein has signed this agreement and been sentenced. 
Upon the execution of this agreement, the United States, in consultation 
with and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, shall 
select an attorney representative for these persons, who shall be paid for 
by Epstein. Epstein's counsel may contact the identified individuals 
through that representative. 
8. 
If any of the individuals referred to in paragraph (7), supra, elects to 
file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the 
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District 
of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein waives 
his right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages 
up to an amount as agreed to between the identified individual and 
Epstein, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and agrees to waive any other 
claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common law. 
Notwithstanding this waiver, as to those individuals whose names 
appear on the list provided by the United States, Epstein's signature on 
this agreement, his waivers and failures to contest liability and such 
damages in any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any 
criminal or civil liability. 
9. 
Epstein's signature on this agreement also is not to be construed as an 
admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional 
or other defense as to any person whose name does not appear on the 
list provided by the United States. 
10. 
Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 
U.S.C. § 2255, as set forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's 
signature on this agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or 
settlements by Epstein are to be construed as admissions or evidence of 
civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other 
defense as to any person, whether or not her name appears on the list 
provided by the United States. 
11. 
Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be 
Page 4 of 7 

sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no 
objection to Epstein self-reporting to begin serving his sentence not 
later than January 4, 2008. 
12. 
Epstein agrees that he will not be afforded any benefits with respect to 
gain time, other than the rights, opportunities, and benefits as any other 
inmate, including but not limited to, eligibility for gain time credit 
based on standard rules and regulations that apply in the State of 
Florida. At the United States' request, Epstein agrees to provide an 
accounting of the gain time he earned during his period of 
incarceration. 
13. 
The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any 
public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information 
Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of 
the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that 
disclosure. 
Epstein understands that the United States Attorney has no authority to require the 
State Attorney's Office to abide by any terms of this agreement. Epstein understands that 
it is his obligation to undertake discussions with the State Attorney's Office and to use his 
best efforts to ensure compliance with these procedures, which compliance will be necessary 
to satisfy the United States' interest. Epstein also understands that it is his obligation to use 
his best efforts to convince the Judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit to accept Epstein's binding 
recommendation regarding the sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to 
do so will be a breach of the agreement. 
In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation 
in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions 
of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal char es 
against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to 
Further, upon execution of this 
agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury 
investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held 
in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement. The 
defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to quash certain. 
grand jury subpoenas. Both parties agree to maintain their evidence, specifically evidence 
requested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued, and 
including certain computer equipment, inviolate until all of the terms of this agreement have 
been satisfied. 
Upon the successful completion of the terms of this agreement, all 
outstanding grand jury subpoenas shall be deemed withdrawn. 
Page 5 of 7 

By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is 
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach 
of any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement 
and to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all 
federal offenses. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that 
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further 
is aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court 
may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting 
a charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein 
hereby requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such 
prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to 
the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be 
deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such 
prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute 
of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing of this 
agreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the 
grand jury's investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the 
Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all 
felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees 
and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the 
subject of the grand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed 
by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as 
to any such offense.

Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons’ Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey 
Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
New York, New York 
Introduction and Background 
According to its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP)’s current mission statement is “Corrections 
professionals who foster a humane and secure 
environment and ensure public safety by preparing 
individuals for successful reentry into our 
communities.”  However, the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has 
repeatedly identified long-standing operational 
challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to 
operate its institutions safely and securely.  Many of 
those same operational challenges, including staffing 
shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide, 
functional security camera systems, and management 
failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and 
procedures, were again identified by the OIG during 
this investigation and review into the custody, care, and 
supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious 
inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. 
The OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of 
information from the BOP that on August 10, 2019, in 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, 
New York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged 
in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit 
(SHU).  The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 
City of New York, determined that Epstein had died 
by suicide. 
The OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s 
investigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.  
Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of 
Epstein’s death and determined there was no 
criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died. 
This report concerns the OIG’s findings regarding MCC 
New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision of 
Epstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on 
federal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2019, until his 
death on August 10.   
Epstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7 
Epstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due 
to media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of 
his notoriety.  SHU inmates are securely separated 
from general population inmates and kept locked in 
their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. 
BOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at 
least twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at 
least one round in the SHU each shift.  BOP policy also 
requires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour 
period.  Among other things, inmate counts and rounds 
enable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they 
are secure in their cells and in good health.  Further, to 
eliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU 
staff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells 
daily, and to search the entire SHU every week.   
On July 18, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and 
ordered him detained pending trial on the 
criminal charges. 
Incident Involving Epstein on July 23 
While in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on 
numerous occasions by psychological staff, including a 
formal suicide assessment on July 9.  In the evaluations 
he denied having thoughts or a history of attempted 
suicide.  Psychological staff determined Epstein did not 
meet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis. 
On July 23, at 1:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO) 
responded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found 
Epstein with an orange cloth around his neck.  Epstein’s 
cellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.  
Medical staff examined Epstein, observed friction 
marks and superficial reddening around his neck and 
on his knee, and placed him on suicide watch.  BOP 
policy requires that inmates identified as suicide risks 
be placed on suicide watch until no longer at imminent 
risk.  The BOP uses a less restrictive monitoring form, 

i i ii 
psychological observation, for inmates who are 
stabilizing but not yet ready to return to a housing unit.  
Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24 but 
remained under psychological observation until July 30. 
Epstein first told MCC New York staff he thought his 
cellmate had tried to kill him, but later said he did not 
know what occurred and did not want to talk about 
how he had sustained his injuries.  Epstein also later 
asked if he could be housed with the same cellmate.  
Another inmate housed on the same SHU tier told the 
OIG that he heard Epstein’s cellmate call for assistance, 
and that Epstein’s cellmate told him that Epstein tried 
to hang himself from the bunkbed ladder.  Disciplinary 
charges against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation were 
not sustained due to insufficient evidence. 
Following the July 23 incident, the Psychology 
Department determined Epstein needed to be housed 
with an appropriate cellmate, and on July 30 it sent an 
email to over 70 MCC New York employees informing 
them of this requirement.  The Warden at the time told 
the OIG that he selected a new cellmate for Epstein in 
consultation with BOP executive leadership.  That 
inmate remained Epstein’s cellmate until August 9. 
Events of August 8–10, 2019, and 
Epstein’s Death 
On August 8, the U.S. Marshals Service sent two emails 
notifying numerous MCC New York staff that Epstein’s 
cellmate was being transferred to another facility on 
August 9.  However, no action was taken to ensure 
Epstein was assigned another cellmate. 
Also on August 8, Epstein met with his attorneys at the 
prison, as he had on prior occasions, and signed a new 
Last Will and Testament.  MCC New York officials did 
not learn about the new Will until after Epstein’s death. 
The following day, August 9, Epstein’s cellmate was 
transferred to another facility and he was not assigned 
a new cellmate.  Additionally, on that date, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unsealed 
approximately 2,000 pages of documents in civil 
litigation involving Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later 
convicted in December 2021 of conspiring with Epstein 
to sexually abuse minors over the course of a decade.  
The documents contain substantial derogatory 
information about Epstein and there is extensive media 
coverage of information in the unsealed documents. 
Also on August 9, after meeting at the prison with his 
lawyers, MCC New York staff allowed Epstein to make, 
in violation of BOP policy, an unrecorded, unmonitored 
telephone call before he was returned to his SHU cell.  
Although Epstein said he was calling his mother, in 
actuality he called someone with whom he allegedly 
had a personal relationship.  
At approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, SHU inmates 
were locked in their cells for the night, including Epstein 
who was without a cellmate.  A search of Epstein’s cell 
following his death revealed Epstein had excess prison 
blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell, and that some 
had been ripped to create nooses.  Only one SHU cell 
search was documented on August 9, and it was not of 
Epstein’s cell.  BOP records did not indicate when 
Epstein’s cell was last searched.  The OIG also found 
that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds 
after about 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and that none of the 
required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 
p.m. on August 9.  Count slips and round sheets were 
falsified to show that they had been performed. 
On August 10, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the two SHU 
staff on duty, CO Tova Noel and Material Handler 
Michael Thomas, began delivering breakfast to SHU 
inmates.  Noel unlocked the door to Epstein’s SHU tier.  
When Thomas attempted to deliver breakfast to 
Epstein through the food slot in his locked cell door, 
Epstein did not respond to Thomas’s verbal commands.  
Thomas unlocked the cell door and saw Epstein 
hanged.  Thomas immediately yelled for Noel to get 
help and call for a medical emergency. 
Thomas told the OIG that when he entered Epstein’s 
cell, Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a 
sheet or a shirt, around his neck that was tied to the 
top portion of the bunkbed.  Epstein was suspended 
from the top bunk in a near-seated position, with his 
buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off 
the floor.  Thomas said he immediately ripped the 
orange string from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s buttocks 
dropped to the ground.  Thomas then lowered Epstein’s 
body to the floor and began chest compressions until 
responding MCC New York staff members arrived 
approximately 1 minute later.  Shortly thereafter, 
outside medical personnel arrived and took over the 
emergency response, eventually removing Epstein to a 
local hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical 
Examiner performed an autopsy and determined the 

iii 
cause of death was hanging and the manner of death 
was suicide.  Blood toxicology tests did not reveal any 
medications or illegal substances in Epstein’s system.  
The Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy told 
the OIG that Epstein’s injuries were consistent with 
suicide by hanging and that there was no evidence of 
defensive wounds that would be expected if his death 
had been a homicide.  Epstein did not have marks on 
his hands, broken fingernails or debris under them, 
contusions to his knuckles that would have evidenced a 
fight, or, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to 
convulsing from hanging, bruising on his body. 
The Limited Available Video Evidence 
Recorded video evidence for August 9 and 10 for the 
SHU area where Epstein was housed was only available 
from one prison security camera due to a malfunction 
of MCC New York’s Digital Video Recorder system that 
occurred on July 29, 2019.  While the prison’s cameras 
continued to provide live video feeds, recordings were 
made for only about half the cameras.  MCC New York 
personnel discovered this failure on August 8, 2019, but 
it was not repaired until after Epstein’s death.  As 
detailed in this report, like many other BOP facilities, 
MCC New York had a history of security 
camera problems. 
The available recorded video footage from the one SHU 
camera captured a large part of the common area of 
the SHU and portions of the stairways leading to the 
different SHU tiers, including Epstein’s cell tier.  Thus, 
anyone entering or attempting to enter Epstein’s SHU 
tier from the SHU common area would have been 
picked up by that video camera.  Epstein’s cell door, 
however, was not in the camera’s field of view.  The OIG 
reviewed the video and found that, between 
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and about 
6:30 a.m. on August 10, no one was seen entering 
Epstein’s cell tier from the SHU common area.  The OIG 
determined that movements captured on video before 
and after those times were generally consistent with 
employee actions as described by witnesses and 
documented in BOP records. 
Results of the OIG’s Investigation and Review 
The OIG’s investigation and review identified numerous 
and serious failures by MCC New York staff, including 
multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies 
and procedures.  The OIG found that MCC New York 
staff failed on August 9 to carry out the Psychology 
Department’s directive that Epstein be assigned a 
cellmate, and that an MCC New York supervisor allowed 
Epstein to make an unmonitored telephone call the 
evening before his death.  Additionally, we found that 
staff failed to undertake required measures designed 
to make sure that Epstein and other SHU inmates were 
accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate 
counts and 30-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, 
and ensuring adequate supervision of the SHU and the 
functionality of the video camera surveillance system. 
The OIG also found that several staff falsified BOP 
records relating to inmate counts and rounds and 
lacked candor during their OIG interviews.  Two MCC 
New York employees, Noel and Thomas, were charged 
criminally with falsifying BOP records.  The charges 
were later dismissed after they successfully fulfilled 
deferred prosecution agreements.  The U.S. Attorney’s 
Office for the Southern District of New York declined 
prosecution for other MCC New York employees who 
the OIG found created false documentation. 
The combination of these and other failures led to 
Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell, which 
contained an excessive amount of bed linens, from 
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was 
discovered hanged in his locked cell the following day. 
While the OIG determined MCC New York staff engaged 
in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence 
contradicting the FBI’s determination regarding the 
absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein 
died.  We did not find, for example, evidence that 
anyone was present in the SHU area where Epstein was 
housed during the relevant timeframe other than the 
inmates who were locked in their assigned cells.  The 
SHU housing unit was securely separated from the 
general inmate population and inmates were kept 
locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.  
Access to the SHU was controlled by multiple locked 
doors.  Within the SHU, the entrance to each tier could 
be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or 
bottom of the staircase leading to the individual tier.  
Keys to open the locked tier doors were available to a 
limited number of COs while on duty.  Each tier had 
eight cells and each individual cell, which was made of 
cement and metal, could be accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which a limited number of COs 
had keys while on duty.  The SHU cell doors were made 
of solid metal with a small glass window and small 
locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff 
inmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates.  As 
a further security measure, during each shift a limited 
number of the COs had keys while on duty. 

iv 
SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on 
August 9, all SHU inmates, including Epstein, were 
locked in their cells for the evening and we found no 
evidence to the contrary.  The prison’s recorded video 
did not identify any staff or other individuals 
approaching Epstein’s SHU tier from the SHU common 
area between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 
and about 6:30 a.m. on August 10.  Additionally, the 
OIG did not observe on the recorded video that Noel 
and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU 
Officers’ Station immediately outside the area where 
Epstein was housed, at any time during the time period 
rose from their seats or approached the cell block.  We 
additionally found that Thomas’s and Noel’s reaction on 
the morning of August 10 upon finding Epstein hanging 
in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the 
responding Lieutenant, and inmates, was consistent 
with their being unaware of any potential harm to 
Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s cell at about 
6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
None of the MCC New York staff members we 
interviewed were aware of any information suggesting 
Epstein’s cause of death was something other than 
suicide.  Additionally, none of the inmates we 
interviewed had any credible information suggesting 
Epstein’s cause of death was something other than 
suicide.  Further, the SHU staff and three interviewed 
inmates with a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell door 
on the night of his death stated that no one entered or 
exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein 
to his cell on August 9. 
As noted, the surveillance camera in the SHU area 
where Epstein was housed was live streaming 
movement in the hallway outside of Epstein’s cell.  
Although the camera was not recording the captured 
video, the camera was in plain view of the inmates and 
therefore inmates would have been aware that any 
hallway movements, including into or out of Epstein’s 
cell, could be monitored by BOP staff, even if, 
unbeknownst to them, the DVR system was not 
recording the live stream at that time.  As the OIG has 
noted in numerous prior reports, BOP staff and 
inmates are aware of where prison cameras are located 
and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where 
they know cameras are not located.   
We noted as well that Epstein had previously been 
placed on suicide watch and psychological observation 
due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous 
nooses made from the excess prison sheets were 
found in his cell on the morning of August 10; that no 
weapons were recovered from his cell after his death; 
and that he signed a new Last Will and Testament on 
August 8, 2 days before he died.  We found that the 
staff’s failure to assign Epstein a cellmate on August 9; 
failure to conduct rounds and counts that evening; and 
to allow him to have excess linens in his cell, left 
Epstein unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for 
hours, which provided him an opportunity to 
commit suicide. 
Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the 
autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were 
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by 
hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation.  The 
Medical Examiner also cited the absence of debris 
under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, 
contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body 
evidencing a struggle, which would be expected if 
Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation. 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
This is not the first time the OIG has found significant 
job performance and management failures on the part 
of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP 
policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are 
safe, secure, and in good health.  The combination of 
negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance 
failures documented in this report all contributed to an 
environment in which arguably one of the BOP’s most 
notorious inmates was provided with the opportunity 
to take his own life, resulting in significant questions 
being asked about the circumstances of his death, how 
it could have been allowed to happen, and most 
importantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of 
whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged 
crimes, of their ability to seek justice through the 
criminal justice process.  The fact that these failures 
have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse 
them and gives additional urgency to the need for DOJ 
and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, 
surveillance, safety and security, and related problems 
plaguing the BOP. 
The OIG made eight recommendations to the BOP to 
address the numerous issues identified during our 
investigation and review.  Finally, we recommended 
that the BOP review the conduct and performance of 
the BOP personnel as described in this report and 
determine whether discipline or other administrative 
action with regard to each of them is appropriate.

Chapter 1:  Introduction 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is a component of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that operates 
122 institutions across the United States.  According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is 
“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by 
preparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.”  However, the DOJ Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing 
operational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions 
safely and securely.  Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP.  As we detail in 
this report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing 
shortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional 
security camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and 
procedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into 
the custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein.  We 
therefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address 
these recurring issues. 
The OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of 
August 10, 2019, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York), 
inmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU).  The SHU 
is a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked 
in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and 
other inmates.  Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2019, the day after his arrest, due to the 
significant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates. 
According to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, 
all SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening.  Additionally, the six separate 
tiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked.  At approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 
2019, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver 
breakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors.  When SHU staff entered the tier to 
deliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell.  Epstein, who was 
housed alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff.  SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein 
hanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top 
portion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell.  Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position 
with his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on 
the floor in front of him.  Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple 
nooses that had been made from torn prison linens. 
SHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency 
and prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 911 emergency services.  SHU 
staff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s buttocks to drop to the 
ground.  SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR).  At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU.  A responding 
MCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated 
external defibrillator and call for the duty nurse.  A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR 
on Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant.  At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and 

moved by medical staff to the MCC New York Health Service Unit.1  The Clinical Nurse continuously 
administered CPR until he was relieved by outside Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) when they arrived 
at the Health Services Area minutes later.  The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered 
medication and fluids in their efforts to revive him.  At approximately 7:10 a.m., Epstein was transported by 
the EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he was pronounced 
dead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m.  On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical 
Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was 
hanging and the manner of death was suicide. 
The OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s 
investigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.  Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause 
of Epstein’s death.  The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died.  
This report concerns the OIG’s findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision 
of Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2019, until his death on 
August 10, 2019. 
The OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as 
multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures.  Among the most significant was the 
failure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2019, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of 
MCC New York that day.  Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a written direction 
that the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 30 after Epstein was removed from suicide 
watch and psychological observation following a possible attempted suicide by him on July 23.  As a result of 
the failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9 
until he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following morning.  In 
addition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including 
overnight on August 9-10, and allowed Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.  
These failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution, 
and provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of 
August 10 without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff. 
The OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had allowed Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to 
make an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom 
he allegedly had a personal relationship.  Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers 
in a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York 
officials did not learn about until after his death. 
Additionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff 
on duty the night of August 9–10, 2019, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier 
in which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim 
Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and 
Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and 
allows EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can 
directly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.  If EMTs had to be escorted 
to the housing unit, they would first need to be thoroughly screened, which would delay medical attention. 

that they had conducted all of the required counts of inmates and 30-minute rounds during their shifts 
within the SHU.  As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 30-minute rounds are two 
means by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being.  BOP and 
MCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility 
at designated times each day.  Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member 
observe all SHU inmates at least once during the first 30 minutes of each hour (e.g., 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.) 
and again during the second 30 minutes of the hour (e.g., 12:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates 
are observed at least twice per hour.  BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 30-minute 
rounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”2 
During the OIG’s investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York 
SHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2019, at approximately 4 p.m., 
until Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August 10, 2019.  However, in documentation 
completed by the SHU staff on duty during that period, staff members falsely certified in the count slips that 
they had conducted the required counts.  Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that the staff assigned 
to the MCC New York SHU did not conduct any required 30-minute rounds of inmates after approximately 
10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019.  Again, however, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely certified in 
the round sheet that the required rounds were conducted.  The combination of these and other failures led 
to Epstein being unmonitored and locked alone in his cell, which the OIG found contained an excessive 
amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his cell 
at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day. 
While the OIG determined that MCC New York staff committed significant violations of BOP and MCC 
New York policies and falsified records related to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did 
not uncover evidence that contradicted the FBI’s determination regarding the absence of criminality in 
connection with how Epstein died.  All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said 
they did not know of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than 
suicide.  Additionally, none of the 15 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this 
investigation, 10 of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and 10, had any credible information 
suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.  Further, the SHU staff and the 
three interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that 
no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of 
August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU.  SHU staff 
told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were locked in their cells for the 
evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could have gotten out of their cells.  
Additionally, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common 
area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system’s 
recording issues that we detail in this report.3  The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any 
Correctional Officers (CO) or other individuals approaching any of the SHU tiers, including the L Tier where 
These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute 
Check Sheet.” 
For reasons we describe below, while the camera inside the L Tier was working and transmitting live video, the video 
was not being recorded. 

Epstein was housed, from the common area of the SHU between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and 
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were 
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation.  The 
Medical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, 
contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which 
would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation. 
As discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not 
the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of 
BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe, 
secure, and in good health.  The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of 
official BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies 
with the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera 
systems at BOP institutions.  The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance 
failures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most 
notorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life.  The BOP’s 
failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, 
but also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively 
deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.  
The fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional 
urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP. 
Unless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining 
whether DOJ personnel have committed misconduct.  The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this 
same standard when reviewing a federal agency’s decision to take adverse action against an employee 
based on such misconduct.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7701(c)(1)(B) and 5 C.F.R. § 1201.56(b)(1)(ii). 
In Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including identification and a description of 
significant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the applicable laws, federal 
regulations, and BOP policies.  In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events.  In Chapter 4, we set forth 
our findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death.  In Chapter 5, we set 
forth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8–10, 2019, including Epstein’s death.  In Chapter 6, 
we set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security 
camera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s 
death.  Finally, Chapter 7 contains our conclusions and recommendations. 

Chapter 2:  Background 
I. 
Significant Entities and Individuals 
Jeffrey Epstein was born in 1953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and 
ultimately developed considerable wealth.  On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for 
the Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex 
trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2.  These 
charges were based on allegations that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein paid girls as young as 14 years old 
hundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.  
The indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash 
to recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein. 
On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States 
from France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center, 
located at 150 Park Row in New York, New York (MCC New York).  Following a detention hearing on July 15, 
2019, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court’s finding that he was a 
danger to the community and a flight risk. 
MCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides 
pretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.  
The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2021 due to substandard conditions that are 
unrelated to this investigation.  When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 750 inmates 
at any given time.  Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals 
with pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were 
serving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should 
remain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial 
flight risk, or both.  MCC New York has several different housing units.  Epstein was initially assigned to MCC 
New York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2019, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) 
pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety 
among the other inmates.  The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely 
separated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per 
day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
Correctional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC 
New York SHU at 12 a.m. on August 10, 2019.4  During their shift, they each created and submitted falsified 
official BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and 
signed more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 30-minute rounds (often 
Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. on August 9, 2019, followed by an overtime shift in the 
SHU from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019.  Thomas did not work his regular shift as a Material Handler in a 
different location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
August 10, 2019. 

referred to as a “round sheet”) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in 
fact, they had not.5 
On November 19, 2019, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York 
returned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple 
counts each of falsification of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001(a)(3), and 2.  The indictment 
alleged that on August 9, 2019, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. counts of inmates 
in the MCC New York SHU, and that on August 10, 2019, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the 
mandatory 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 30-minute rounds within the MCC New York 
SHU.  The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submitted false 
documentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to 
perform their assigned duties.  As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU, 
including Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from 
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019, until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 2019, when 
Epstein was found hanged in his cell. 
On May 25, 2021, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred 
prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas.  Their respective agreements, which are part of the court 
record in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had 
conducted counts and rounds.  The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely 
disclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete 100 hours of 
community service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision 
and their establishment of good behavior.  On December 13, 2021, after Noel and Thomas successfully 
fulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all 
charges pending against them.  Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count 
slips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death. 
As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and 
Thomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor 
judgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties. 
II. 
Methodology 
During the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one 
occasion.  The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the 
SHU on August 9-10, 2019; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden, 
Associate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC 
New York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had 
These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check 
Sheet.”  Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-minute 
rounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed. 

requested to provide information.6  The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included 
employees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the 
days leading up to the response and following the response, as well as other individuals with information 
pertinent to our investigation.  Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of 15 inmates who had been 
housed at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were 
housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.7  Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells 
opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9–10.  
The OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s attorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information, 
but ultimately the attorney declined to be interviewed, citing attorney-client privilege (the attorney-client 
privilege survives a client’s death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate. 
The OIG also collected over 127,000 documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs.  Among 
these were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports; 
documentation regarding inmate counts and 30-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment 
documentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating 
to Epstein; Epstein’s institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein’s visits with his 
attorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and 
contractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC 
New York security camera system; service records for MCC New York’s security camera system; MCC 
New York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of 
August 10, 2019; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records.  
The OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones.  
In addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-302), notes from 
witness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications.  The OIG also reviewed Epstein’s 
autopsy report and interviewed the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Epstein. 
III. 
Applicable Law, Regulations, and BOP Policies 
A. 
Standards of Conduct 
The Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch sets out general principles that are 
designed to “ensure that every citizen can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal 
Government.”8  Among other things, these standards require that every federal employee “use official time 
On a separate occasion, the relative contacted the OIG to say that the relative had “photographic proof” that the door 
to Epstein’s cell was left open the night Epstein died.  When the OIG followed up with the relative to request copies of 
the photographs and any information regarding this allegation, the relative stated that upon further review, the 
photographs did not show what the relative previously communicated to the OIG. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from inmates housed in the L Tier of 
the SHU on the night that Epstein died, each of whom was represented by counsel.  Three inmates agreed to be 
interviewed.  The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not 
DOJ employees. 
5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(a). 

in an honest effort to perform official duties.”9  The ethical regulations also mandate that federal employees 
not use federal property “for other than authorized activities.”10 
BOP policy (Program Statement 3420.11, Standards of Employee Conduct) imposes several additional 
standards of conduct on its employees.  At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a 
manner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”  
Because “[i]nattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other 
incidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours.”  BOP policy 
provides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies 
that personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official 
working hours.”  BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.” 
B. 
False Statements and Lack of Candor 
Under federal law, “whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive…branch of the 
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully…makes or uses any false writing or document 
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated 
U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3).  The terms “knowingly and willfully” mean that the subject acted with knowledge that 
the conduct was, in a general sense, prohibited by law.  It is not required that the subject was aware of the 
existence of Section 1001. 
Under BOP standards of conduct discussed above, employees are required to cooperate fully with official 
investigations, which includes providing “all pertinent information they may have” and “truthfully responding 
to questions.” 
C. 
Relevant BOP Policies Regarding the Operation of Correctional Facilities 
1. Special Housing Units 
SHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 541.21-541.33.  These 
regulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the 
general inmate population.”  These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 5270.11, Special 
Housing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary 
segregation status.  Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate 
“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of 
correctional facilities, or protect the public.”  There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in 
administrative detention status, including when an inmate’s presence in the general inmate population 
presents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of 
the inmate.  Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault, 
acting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff 
concerns about the inmate’s safety. 
5 C.F.R. § 2635.705(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(b)(5). 
5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.704(a). 

Inmates in the SHU are securely separated from general population inmates and are kept locked in their cell 
when in their assigned tier within the SHU.  As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the 
OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.  BOP policy provides that, 
weather and resources permitting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters 
hours per calendar week.  Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the 
opportunity to shower at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in 1-hour periods.  SHU inmates 
may also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court 
appearances, medical and psychological attention.  The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all 
visitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on 
work details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception.  The MCC 
New York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought 
into a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate’s cell through the food slot in the 
inmate’s locked cell door. 
BOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 30 continuous calendar days are to be examined 
and interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate’s adjustment and the threat 
presented to self or others. 
BOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other 
things, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit.  When a staff 
member is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff 
member must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permitted to ask questions 
about the duties. 
2. Inmate Accountability11 
a. 
Counts 
Inmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are 
accounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility.  BOP policy requires that each 
institution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on 
“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at 10:00 a.m.”  At least 1 count a day during 
the week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that 
inmates are required to stand when they are counted.  MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that 
counts must occur at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at 10 p.m. 
daily and also at 10 a.m. on weekends and federal holidays. 
The BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates 
while the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier.  This 
requirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders.  The two officers will then switch roles 
and compare the count numbers.  If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count 
in the same manner.  When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate’s body and 
not rely solely on movement or sound.  Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control 
This section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review.  The 
BOP utilizes a variety of other security and inmate accountability tools in addition to those discussed in this section, 
which are described in BOP Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual. 

Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates, and then remain in the unit until the Control 
Center accepts the count.  If a count reported verbally does not match the master count, then the Control 
Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and the staff members must recount the inmates.  If the 
second count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book 
count, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center.  A 
Lieutenant must take at least 1 count in the morning and one in the evening. 
Correctional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers, 
and retained for 30 days.  Count slips may not be altered.  BOP policy provides that the “official count will 
not be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.” 
b. 
30-Minute Rounds 
The BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in administrative detention or 
disciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU.  In such cases, a correctional staff member must 
observe all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 30 minutes (e.g., 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.) and 
again during the second 30 minutes (e.g., 12:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.).  BOP policy provides that these “rounds are 
to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart.”  These same requirements 
for rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York’s SHU. 
c. 
Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement 
BOP policy also provides that each institution must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates 
changes to an inmate’s status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence.  The MCC 
New York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each 
inmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night.  The MCC 
New York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate’s confinement 
should be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log 
of pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer 
system TRUSCOPE, which provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related 
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log. 
d. 
Cell Searches 
BOP policy requires that BOP staff routinely and irregularly search housing units to, among other things, 
maintain sanitary standards and eliminate safety hazards.12  The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require 
that officers assigned to the SHU conduct searches of the SHU common areas and cells, and that the entire 
SHU be searched every week.  BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require written 
documentation of each housing unit search. 
3. Psychological Screening 
a. 
Initial Screening 
Pursuant to BOP policy governing inmates in pretrial detention status (Program Statement 7331.04, Pretrial 
Inmates), all pretrial inmates must have an initial risk/needs assessment screening within 48 hours of 
BOP Program Statement 5521.06, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas. 

admission to the institution.  The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical, 
psychological, and/or other special needs.”  The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates 
“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate’s separation and/or security needs.”  BOP 
policy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a 
significant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates 
regularly is paramount.” 
b. 
Suicide Prevention 
The BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 552.40-552.42, which 
require the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal 
inmates.  Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for committing suicide, 
BOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk. 
BOP policy (Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all 
new inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality.  However, at MCCs, among other facilities 
with high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by 
Psychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or 
appear psychologically unstable.”  Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting 
signs of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant.  BOP policy recognizes that inmates who 
are placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of committing suicide and 
should therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU.  BOP policy 
explicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.”  Any staff member who has 
reason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct, 
continuous observation.” 
Every BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to 
inmates placed on suicide watch.  Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates.  For 
inmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of 
the inmate believed to be at risk of committing suicide.  Following suicide watch and based on clinical 
findings following a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to 
a medical referral or health care facility.  Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual 
monitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general 
population or restrictive housing.  While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide 
watch gown and will be allowed a suicide watch blanket. 
As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch 
when the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal.  During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant 
observation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special mattress, 
blanket, and smock to wear.  Although psychological observation is a lower classification, witnesses told the 
OIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that 
inmates were allowed to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the 
Psychology Department.  At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see how an inmate was 
doing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit. 

4. Suicide Response 
Recognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and 
inmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that 
“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.”  The MCC 
New York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.  
These orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the 
situation.  The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be 
taken to open the inmate’s airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff 
believe that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.”  MCC New York staff are to continue 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer.  The BOP policy 
governing crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately attend to an 
apparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence 
over efforts to preserve a crime scene.13 
5. Inmate Discipline 
Federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 541.1-541.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 5270.09, Inmate Discipline 
Program) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and 
orderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public.  The inmate discipline 
program applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges.  One of the 
guiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree 
as necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution.  “Tattooing or 
self-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program.  This 
prohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale.  The BOP defines 
“tattooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible patterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect 
by removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cutting falls within this offense).”14  The 
definition does not make an explicit reference to suicide attempts other than inclusion of “wrist cutting.” 
Among other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts, 
describes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.  
As relevant to this matter, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a 
prohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident.  A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged 
inmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident.  If an inmate 
appears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will 
examine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process.  If the 
inmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category, 
the matter is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to 
whether the inmate committed the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to 
the severity of the prohibited act.  At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permitted to

released to the public in its entirety. 
BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts. 

choose a staff representative, make a statement, and call witnesses.  The inmate is also allowed to appeal 
the outcome through the BOP’s administrative remedy program. 
6. Conditions of Confinement 
a. 
Telephone Calls 
The federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 540.100-540.106, that govern telephone calls for inmates require that 
the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate telephone conversations, which 
is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution and to protect the public.”  For 
safety and security reasons, BOP policy (Program Statement P5264.08, Inmate Telephone Regulations) 
requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.  BOP policy 
recognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permitted to make a telephone 
call outside of the Inmate Telephone System.  In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a 
secure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.”  Additionally, the staff 
member coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the 
inmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual 
called, and the reason for the call.  The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the 
telephone recording system within 7 days. 
b. 
Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens 
Federal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in administrative detention status ordinarily 
may have a reasonable amount of personal property.15  Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal 
property of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”16  
The BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU.  Restricted medications 
are administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds.  Each institution determines “the medication(s) and 
amount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.”  Inmates may also purchase pre-
approved over-the-counter medications at the commissary.  MCC New York General Housing Units Post 
Orders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove 
all limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed.  These 
Post Orders further specify that all cells are to be cleaned daily by inmates occupying the cell, and that 
blankets, towels, and other linens will not be used as rugs or hung over inmate bunk beds at any time.  
Pursuant to these Post Orders, MCC New York housing unit officers on all three shifts are responsible for 
maintaining “a high level of sanitation” and a “safe and clean environment.”

Chapter 3:  Timeline of Key Events 
Except as otherwise noted, the following information is derived from the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons (BOP) records and the Office of the Inspector General’s interviews. 
September 21–24, 
2018 
The BOP awards contracts to two companies (Company 1 and 2) to 
upgrade the security camera system at Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York, New York (MCC New York).  At the time, images from the 
MCC New York’s analog video cameras are recorded to a Digital Video 
Recorder (DVR) system, which is divided into two DVR systems.  Cameras 
assigned to the DVR 1 system record only to the DVR 1 hard drives, and 
cameras assigned to DVR 2 system record only to the DVR 2 hard drives. 
March 17, 2019 
In connection with MCC New York’s upgrade of its security camera 
system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office begins arranging for 
technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) 
assignments to MCC New York to perform necessary mechanical, 
electrical, plumbing, and wiring work.  However, during the course of the 
TDY rotations, work is not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade 
because TDY personnel are sometimes used to cover shortages at MCC 
New York’s custody posts. 
July 2, 2019 
According to court records, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New York returns an indictment charging 
Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. 
July 6, 2019 
Epstein is arrested at an airport in New Jersey and is transported for 
detention pending his initial court appearance to the MCC New York as a 
pretrial detainee.  Epstein is placed in the general inmate population and 
medically screened. 
July 7, 2019 
An MCC New York Facilities Assistant asks the Psychology Department to 
evaluate Epstein because he appears “distraught, sad, and a little 
confused.”  Epstein is assigned to the MCC New York’s Special Housing 
Unit (SHU) because of significant media attention and his notoriety 
among other MCC New York inmates.17 
The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate 
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the 
safety of staff and other inmates. 

July 8, 2019 
According to court records, Epstein is arraigned in federal court and 
enters a plea of not guilty to all charges.  The court sets a detention 
hearing for July 15, 2019. 
MCC New York staff conducts a routine intake screening of Epstein, the 
records of which indicate that Epstein denies a history of any mental 
health problems.  After the Chief Psychologist consults with the National 
Suicide Prevention Coordinator from BOP’s Central Office, the Psychology 
Department conducts a further evaluation of Epstein after his return from 
court.  Records show that Epstein denies any suicidal thoughts but was 
placed on psychological observation due to the presence of risk factors 
(high-profile case, nature of the charges, pre-trial status, and 
ongoing proceedings). 
July 9, 2019 
The Psychology Department administers a formal, in-person suicide risk 
assessment for Epstein.  The Psychology Department continues 
psychological observation for another day pending a suitable 
housing placement. 
July 10, 2019 
The Psychology Department removes Epstein from psychological 
observation and returns him to the SHU with a recommendation that he 
have a cellmate.  Epstein is housed with another inmate (Inmate 1).   
July 11, 2019 
An MCC New York psychologist meets with Epstein briefly and 
recommends follow-up visit to occur the next week. 
July 15, 2019 
According to court records, Epstein appears in court for his 
detention hearing. 
July 16, 2019 
At Epstein’s request, an MCC New York psychologist meets with him 
during a legal visit. 
July 18, 2019 
According to court records, Epstein appears in court for a ruling on the 
issue of detention.  The court orders that Epstein be detained pending 
trial because he presents a danger to the community and he is a 
flight risk. 
The Psychology Department conducts 30-day psychology reviews for the 
entire SHU population.  Epstein is not in the SHU at the time and 
therefore his review is not conducted. 

July 22, 2019 
According to court records, Epstein files an appeal of the court’s order 
denying Epstein pretrial release. 
July 23, 2019 
At approximately 1:27 a.m., SHU staff hears noises coming from Epstein’s 
cell.  Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) says that Epstein has attempted to 
hang himself.  SHU staff observes Epstein lying on the floor with a piece of 
orange cloth around his neck.  Epstein initially tells MCC New York staff 
that his cellmate tried to kill him.  Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) tells MCC 
New York staff that while he was asleep, he felt something hit his legs and 
when he turned on the light, he saw Epstein with a string around his neck 
and called the guards.18 
Epstein is transferred out of the SHU and placed on suicide watch in a cell 
near the Psychology Department and Health Services Unit. 
Later that morning, Health Services Unit personnel conduct a medical 
assessment and observe that Epstein has a red mark two-thirds of the 
way around the front and sides of his neck.  The BOP assesses Epstein for 
risk of suicide and determines that he should remain on suicide watch. 
July 24, 2019 
At approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein is removed from suicide watch but 
remains under psychological observation in the same cell near the 
Psychology Department and Health Services Unit.  Medical staff examine 
Epstein at 1:08 p.m. and Psychological Services staff complete a Post 
Suicide Watch Report.  In contrast to his prior statement that his cellmate 
tried to kill him, Epstein says he does not remember how he sustained 
the injuries to his neck. 
July 25–29, 2019 
Epstein is seen by the Psychology Department daily and on each date 
adamantly denies suicidality or having any memory of what occurred on 
July 23, 2019. 
July 29, 2019 
Psychology Department staff determine that Epstein can be released 
from psychological observation and transferred back to the SHU.19 
When interviewed by the OIG, another inmate housed in the same SHU tier (Inmate 2) at the time of the July 23 
incident said he heard Inmate 1 call for assistance, and that Inmate 1 later told him that Epstein had tried to kill himself 
by hanging himself from the bunkbed ladder. 
The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to the SHU on July 29, 2019, but at his 
request he remained on psychological observation until July 30, 2019.  The BOP’s SENTRY database, which is a BOP 
        Continued 

Disk failures occur in DVR 2 of MCC New York’s security camera system, 
which results in the system being unable to record, although the cameras 
continue to work and broadcast live video feed.  MCC New York personnel 
do not learn of the DVR 2 recording failure until August 8, 2 days before 
Epstein’s death.  Roughly half of MCC New York’s security cameras, 
including those located in the SHU, are assigned to record to the 
DVR 2 system. 
July 30, 2019 
Epstein is transferred back to the SHU.20 
An MCC New York Staff Psychologist from the Psychology Department 
sends an email to over 70 BOP staff members stating that Epstein “needs 
to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”  Epstein and his new cellmate 
(Inmate 3) are placed in a cell within the SHU that can accommodate the 
electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device. 
MCC New York conducts disciplinary proceedings against Epstein for 
alleged self-mutilation and ultimately concludes that there is insufficient 
evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act.21  When Epstein 
is psychologically evaluated in connection with the disciplinary 
proceedings, he says he does not remember how he sustained the marks 
around his neck. 
MCC New York personnel attempt to obtain an estimate from Company 1 
to run the wiring and conduit for the new camera system, which would 
eliminate the need for BOP technicians to perform the work. 
July 31, 2019 
According to court records, Epstein appears in court for a status 
conference, at which time the court sets deadlines for motions and 
responses.  Upon his return to MCC New York, the U.S. Marshals Service 
provide paperwork to BOP that indicates Epstein had 
“suicidal tendencies.” 
database that contains information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs 
of federal inmates, was not updated to reflect this change because it indicated that Epstein was transferred back to the 
SHU on July 29, 2019. 
The OIG’s investigation revealed that at some point after he returned to the SHU from suicide watch and 
psychological observation, Epstein asked two different MCC New York staff members if he can be housed with the same 
cellmate Epstein initially said tried to kill him. 
The BOP’s inmate discipline program and the offense with which Epstein was charged is further described in 
Chapter 2. 

The Psychology Department conducts a clinical visit with Epstein, who 
denies any suicidal ideation. 
August 1, 2019 
MCC New York Receiving and Discharge staff notify the Psychology 
Department of the notation of “suicidal tendencies” on U.S. Marshals 
Service paperwork relating to Epstein.  The Psychology Department 
conducts a suicide risk assessment of Epstein, who denies that he is 
suicidal, and determines that suicide watch is not warranted. 
Psychological staff recommend a follow-up in 1 week. 
August 2, 2019 
MCC New York Special Investigative Services complete its investigation 
into the incident on July 23, 2019, and finds that there is insufficient 
evidence to determine that Epstein harmed himself or that he was 
harmed by his cellmate. 
August 8, 2019 
Epstein is seen by the Psychology Department and denies suicidal 
ideation, intention, or plan. 
Epstein meets with his attorneys and, unbeknownst to MCC New York 
personnel, changes his Last Will and Testament during the meeting. 
MCC New York staff receive notice that Epstein’s cellmate will be 
transferred out of the institution the following day, August 9. 
MCC New York staff discover the disk failures that occurred in the DVR 2 
system on July 29 and that resulted in approximately one half of the 
institution’s security cameras not recording, although the cameras 
continued to broadcast a live video feed.  MCC New York staff do not 
perform the work necessary to restore recording functionality of the 
DVR 2 system or address long-standing performance failures with the 
institution’s camera system. 
August 9, 2019 
At approximately 8:30 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 3) is transferred 
out of MCC New York.  Two MCC New York SHU staff members said they 
notified supervisory staff of Epstein’s cellmate’s transfer and Epstein’s 
need for a new cellmate.  Other witnesses did not corroborate these 
statements.  Epstein is not assigned a new cellmate as required by the 
Psychology Department. 
Sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., Epstein meets with his attorneys in 
the SHU attorney conference room.  Sometime prior to 1 p.m., Epstein’s 

attorneys ask MCC New York staff members if Epstein could be moved to 
a different housing unit or housed without a cellmate. 
MCC New York staff obtain the replacement hard drives to repair the 
institution’s security camera system but do not complete the repairs 
necessary to restore recording functionality and address long-standing 
performance failures with the institution’s DVR 2 system. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unseals approximately 
2,000 pages of documents in civil litigation involving Ghislaine Maxwell, 
who is later convicted in December 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to 
sexually abuse minors over the course of a decade.  Some of these 
documents contain information that may relate to the criminal charges 
pending against Epstein.  There is extensive media coverage of 
information in the unsealed documents. 
At approximately 6:45 p.m., Epstein leaves the attorney conference room. 
At approximately 7 p.m., contrary to BOP policy but with the permission 
of a Unit Manager, Epstein is permitted to place an unmonitored 
telephone call to a number with a New York City area code, purportedly 
to speak with his mother.  In actuality, Epstein speaks with someone with 
whom he allegedly has a personal relationship.  After the call, Epstein is 
returned to his cell, where he remains without a cellmate. 
MCC New York SHU staff members do not conduct the 4 p.m. or 10 p.m. 
inmate counts.  After approximately 10:40 p.m., SHU staff members do 
not conduct the required 30-minute rounds. 
August 10, 2019 
MCC New York SHU staff members do not conduct the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., or 
a.m. inmate counts or any of the 30-minute rounds from 12 a.m. until 
approximately 6:30 a.m. 
At approximately 6:30 a.m., SHU staff begin to deliver breakfast to 
inmates in the SHU through the food slots in the locked cell doors.  When 
SHU staff attempt to deliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff unlock the 
door to the tier in which Epstein’s cell was located and then knock on the 
door to Epstein’s cell.  Epstein, who is housed alone in the cell, does not 
respond to SHU staff.  SHU staff unlock the cell door and find Epstein 
hanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck 
and the other end tied to the top portion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell.  
Epstein is suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position with his 

buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his 
legs extended straight out on the floor in front of him. 
SHU staff immediately activate a body alarm, which notified all MCC 
New York staff of a medical emergency and prompted MCC New York 
staff in the Control Center to call for 911 emergency services.  SHU staff 
then rip the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which causes Epstein’s 
buttocks to drop to the ground.  SHU staff lay Epstein on the ground and 
immediately initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  At 
approximately 6:33 a.m., BOP medical staff respond to the SHU, continue 
CPR, apply the automated external defibrillator, and move Epstein to MCC 
New York’s Health Services Unit.  Minutes after arriving in the Health 
Services Unit, an ambulance arrives and paramedics continue CPR, 
intubate Epstein, and administer medications and fluids.  At 
approximately 7:10 a.m., the ambulance takes Epstein to New York 
Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he is pronounced dead at 
7:36 a.m. by the emergency room physician. 
MCC New York staff unsuccessfully attempts to recover video from the 
DVR 2 system of the SHU and the BOP begins repairing the DVR 2 system.  
The FBI seizes all hard drives contained in the DVR 2 system as evidence. 
August 11, 2019 
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, conducts an 
autopsy of Epstein. 
August 14–15, 2019 
The FBI returns to MCC New York and seizes additional components of 
the DVR 2 system and the entire DVR 1 system.  The FBI’s Digital Forensics 
Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, begins to conduct a forensic analysis of 
MCC New York’s DVR systems and determines that there were 
catastrophic disk failures in the DVR 2 system disk array and no 
recordings were available on the DVR 2 system after July 29, 2019. 
August 16, 2019 
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, releases its 
findings publicly that the cause of Epstein’s death was hanging and that 
the manner of death was suicide. 

Chapter 4:  Custody and Care of Epstein Prior to His Death 
I. 
Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6 
On July 2, 2019, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-
count indictment that charged Epstein with committing sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls, some as young as 14 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida.  The 
indictment alleged that from at least 2002 through 2005, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom 
he knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds 
of dollars in cash.  The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates, 
created a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some 
victims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein.  In 
addition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to 
forfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged 
sex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence. 
On Saturday, July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the 
United States from France.  He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in 
New York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population.  MCC 
New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  The 
BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2021 due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to 
this investigation.  When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not 
yet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain 
in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk, 
or both.  Due to the significant media attention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC 
New York inmates, the following day Epstein was moved to MCC New York’s Special Housing Unit (SHU), a 
housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate 
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their own safety as 
well as the safety of staff and other inmates.  On Monday, July 8, 2019, Epstein appeared in federal court 
and pleaded not guilty to the charges.  The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a 
detention hearing scheduled for July 15, 2019. 
At the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with 
electronic monitoring and other conditions.  The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC 
New York pending trial.  The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the matter of pre-
trial release on July 15, 2019.  On July 18, 2019, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial.  In 
its ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking 
statute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law.  The 
court found that the United States had shown by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the 
safety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of 
repeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were 
found during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2019.  The court also relied on the 
recommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been 
charged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses 
involved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal 

obligations as a registered sex offender.  The court found that the United States had also shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges 
and severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s 
criminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a 
foreign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and 
possession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name.  Finally, the court found 
that Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain 
sworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine 
aspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and 
the proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was 
unacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the 
conduct of a person who paid the trustee’s salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with 
his employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.  Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2019.  
This appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death. 
II. 
MCC New York’s Special Housing Unit 
Epstein was initially assigned to MCC New York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2019, at 
approximately 7:20 p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in 
media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents.  The SHU is a 
housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate 
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well 
as the safety of staff and other inmates.  Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or 
disciplinary segregation status.  Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that 
removes an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security, 
and orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public.  The MCC New York employee who 
was the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2019, told the Office of the Inspector 
General (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked down” in their cells for most of the day.  
Other witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.  
The Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate 
Warden 1 and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons 
that conducting rounds in the SHU was so important.  Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU 
inmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each 
inmate’s cell. 
Witnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his attorneys in the attorney 
conference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.22  MCC New York attorney logs confirmed that Epstein 
had daily visits with attorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at 
MCC New York.  This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains 
information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal 
inmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two attorney visits on all but 1 day he was detained at MCC 
New York.  BOP emails reflect that other attorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Attorney with 
the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because attorneys had to wait hours or were unable to 
As discussed in Chapter 1, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York 
staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological attention, showers, and recreation. 

meet with their clients because Epstein and his attorneys were occupying the attorney conference room, 
even at times when Epstein had to leave the conference room for a medical visit. 
At MCC New York, the SHU was located on the south side of the institution’s ninth floor and was often 
referred to as “9 South.”  Primary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door (Main Exterior Entry 
Door).  That door was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York’s centralized Control Center.  
Access into the SHU was further controlled by a second locked door (Main Interior Entry Door), to which a 
limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) had keys while on duty. 
Secondary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door.  That door was opened remotely by a staff 
member in the centralized Control Center.  Entry into the SHU from the secondary access point was further 
controlled by three additional locked doors, to which a limited number of the COs had keys while on duty.  
The secondary access doors were used only by staff when facilitating visits between the SHU inmates and 
their outside visitors. 
Within the SHU, inmates were assigned to six separate tiers or groups of cells, three of which were 
accessible via stairs leading up from the common area on the ninth floor (Upper Tiers—G, J, and L Tiers) and 
three of which were accessible via stairs leading down from the common area on the ninth floor (Lower 
Tiers—H, K, and M Tiers).  The entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the 
top or bottom of the staircase leading to the individual tier.  A limited number of keys to open the locked tier 
doors were available only to a limited number of COs while on duty.  Each tier had eight cells, each of which 
could house either one or two inmates.  Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be 
accessed only through a single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.  
The SHU cell doors were made of solid metal with a small glass window and small locked slots that 
correctional staff used to handcuff inmates and provide food or toiletries to inmates.  As a further security 
measure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs. 
As noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely separated from the general inmate population and are 
kept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU.  Witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates 
are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.  BOP policy provides that, weather and resources 
permitting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside of their quarters 5 hours per calendar 
week.  Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the opportunity to shower at 
least 3 times a week, typically on different days in 1-hour periods.  SHU inmates may also be escorted from 
their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and 
psychological attention.  The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all visitors to the SHU be 
documented in the SHU visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on work details, 
be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception.  The MCC New York SHU Post 
Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought into a SHU cellblock 
and that all meals be delivered through the cell door food slot of the locked cell door.

III. 
Epstein’s Initial Cell and Cellmate Assignment from July 7 to July 23 
According to the Warden, MCC New York typically housed inmates in the SHU with a cellmate.  Upon 
Epstein’s initial transfer to the SHU on July 7, 2019, he was assigned a cell in the M Tier of the SHU with 
Inmate 1.  The Warden explained that Epstein was a high-profile inmate and that he initially selected 
Inmate 1 to be Epstein’s cellmate because Inmate 1 was another high-profile inmate, and the Warden 
believed Inmate 1 to be the least likely SHU inmate to harm Epstein.23  Epstein and Inmate 1 were housed 
together in cell Z05-124. 
In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in a Florida state court to a felony charge of procurement of minors to engage in 
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03.  As a result of this conviction, Epstein was required to register as a 
sex offender. 

IV. 
Events of July 23 and the Placement of Epstein on Suicide Watch and 
Psychological Observation from July 23 to July 30 
According to BOP documents, at approximately 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Senior Officer Specialists 1 and 2 
heard noise coming from the M Tier in the SHU, the tier where Epstein was housed.  Senior Officer 
Specialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Z05-124, he saw Epstein laying down near 
his bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist 1 wrote in a 
BOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) said Epstein had attempted to hang himself.  In his interview 
with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 1 said that Inmate 1, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had 
been asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him.  Senior Officer 
Specialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the 
Control Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist 1 entered the cell, where they 
secured and removed Epstein’s cellmate.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 reported that he then reentered the 
cell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck.  In his interview 
with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 1 said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was attached to the 
bunkbed ladder in the cell.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 said that Epstein was sitting on the floor of the cell 
with his back against the bunkbed ladder.  Senior Officer Specialist 1’s report said that Epstein was 
breathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations 
Lieutenant and other staff arrived.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 confirmed in his OIG interview that they 
started cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.  
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU, 
she saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and 
boxers.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no 
further injuries.  She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring.  The COs 
unsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his own, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to 
the Health Services Unit. 
According to BOP records, at approximately 1:40 a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on 
suicide watch.  As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a dedicated room, 
typically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff 
or inmates. 
Senior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for 
assistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring.  He and the 
other officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not.  He and other officers then lifted 
Epstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell. 
Senior Officer Specialist 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped 
remove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical 
assessment.  Senior Officer Specialist 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health 
Services Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.  
Epstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had 
threatened to beat him if he did not pay him.  Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 he had not reported 
this to MCC New York staff, but that he had told his lawyers. 

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she returned to the 
Health Services Unit, Senior Officer Specialist 4 informed her that Epstein had said that his cellmate had 
tried to kill Epstein and had been harassing him.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant then spoke 
with the cellmate (Inmate 1), who said he was wearing headphones and was asleep when he felt something 
hit his legs.  Inmate 1 said he called out to Epstein and when Epstein did not answer, he got up, turned on 
the light, and saw Epstein sitting on the floor, leaning to the side with a string around his neck.  Inmate 1 
told the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he then called the guards.  Inmate 1 provided a similar 
statement to BOP officials at approximately 2:50 p.m. on July 23, 2019. 
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant’s report notes that she also spoke with Epstein, who told her that 
he had returned to his cell after an attorney visit at approximately 8 p.m. the previous day, at which time his 
cellmate was reading the Daily News newspaper.  Epstein’s said his cellmate turned to a page of the 
newspaper that had Epstein’s picture and reported that Epstein was worth $77 million.  Epstein told the 
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he looked at his picture, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage.  
Epstein further stated that he woke up at approximately 1 a.m. to get a drink of water, returned to his bunk, 
and the next thing he remembered was that he was snoring and MCC New York staff were inside his cell.  
When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, Epstein said he had been told that if his cellmate 
hurt him, MCC New York staff would not care. 
Inmate 2, who was housed in the same SHU tier as Epstein on July 23, told the FBI about an incident that 
occurred in the SHU around 1:20 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. on an unspecified date.  Inmate 2 said he was reading a 
book when he heard an inmate scream and bang on the cell door to get the SHU officers’ attention.  
Inmate 2 said he could only see the cell door and not inside.  According to Inmate 2, Senior Officer 
Specialist 2 responded to the cell and then left and returned with additional officers.  The FBI was further 
told by Inmate 2 that the officers opened the cell door, removed an inmate, placed the inmate in handcuffs, 
and put the inmate in the shower area.  Inmate 2 stated that the officers reentered the cell and Inmate 2 
heard a thump as if something had hit the floor.  The officers then pulled the other inmate out of the cell, 
placed him on a stretcher, and took him away.  Inmate 2 also told the FBI that, later in the evening, around 
2:10 a.m. to 2:15 a.m., the COs returned to the cell where the incident had occurred earlier.  He said he 
further observed the officers clean out the cell and use a video camera to record the inside of the cell.  
Inmate 2 said he saw the officers remove from the cell orange clothing items that had been tied together.  
Inmate 2 also said that the first inmate to be removed from the cell later told Inmate 2 that he was sleeping 
when his cellmate had tried to kill himself by hanging himself from the ladder of the bed. 
According to BOP records, medical staff evaluated Epstein at approximately 6:20 a.m. on July 23, 2019, and 
observed friction marks and superficial reddening of his neck and one knee.  The red mark spanned two-
thirds of Epstein’s neck (front and sides) and was 2 inches wide.  Epstein told the medical staff that he did 
not know what had caused his injuries, and that he went to drink a little water and woke up snoring. 
Later that morning, the MCC New York Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment and 
determined that Epstein should remain on suicide watch.  During the assessment, Epstein denied any 
knowledge of how he sustained the marks on his neck.  The Staff Psychologist noted in the assessment 
report that it was unclear whether Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if someone else did.  
Medical staff examined Epstein at approximately 1:08 p.m. the following day, July 24, 2019, and observed 
that the central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion.  According to BOP records, 
Epstein told the medical staff that he still did not want to talk about how he sustained his injuries, but he 

believed that his cellmate had something to do with it.  BOP’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) opened an 
investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had 
been assaulted. 
On July 24, 2019, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch.  However, Epstein 
remained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation 
until July 30, 2019.24 
The MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the 
inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal.  During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant 
observation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special mattress, 
blanket, and smock to wear.  The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a 
lower classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except 
that inmates were allowed to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by 
Psychology Department.  At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see how an inmate was 
doing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit. 
The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who 
goes on and off suicide watch.  The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes 
recommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of 
suicide watch.  According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off 
of suicide watch be housed with other inmates; however, she said the recommendations cannot always be 
carried out due to other security factors.  When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends 
conducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates. 
The Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide 
Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive 
staff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.25  The Chief 
Psychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be 
housed with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision. 
According to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted 
disciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was 
insufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act.  When Epstein was psychologically 
evaluated on July 30, 2019, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember 
how he obtained the marks around his neck.  On August 2, 2019, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2019, 
incident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself 
or that he had been harmed by his cellmate. 
Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU 
on July 30, 2019. 
Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders. 

Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could 
be paired up with Inmate 1 again.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 told Epstein that his request was something he 
would need to raise with the Operations Lieutenant.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that Epstein 
replied, “Yeah, but I don’t understand, you know, we were bunkies, everything was cool.”  The Chief 
Psychologist also told the OIG that Epstein mentioned to her that he wanted Inmate 1 to continue to be 
his cellmate. 
V. 
The Psychology Department’s Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed 
to Have an Appropriate Cellmate 
Following the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed 
to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.  To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to 
MCC New York staff, on July 30, 2019, at 12:30 p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 70 MCC 
New York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #76318-054 is being taken off Psych Observation and 
needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”  A review of the email recipients showed that the email 
was sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS 
Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning 
Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO 1.  The Staff Psychologist also 
completed a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs 
to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” 
The Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was 
ready to return to the SHU.  According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding 
Epstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate.  He added that MCC New York would typically house an 
inmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate.  The Warden stated there was no BOP policy 
mandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an 
inmate with a cellmate. 
During their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said 
they had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU 
staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement.  Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on 
multiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and attentive about Epstein’s special needs. 
According to Associate Warden 1, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.  
Associate Warden 1 said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant 
should have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement.  Associate Warden 1 further told the OIG 
that the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.  
Associate Warden 1 told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and 
said she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while 
performing her rounds. 
The Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the 
cellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure 
that Epstein had a cellmate.  Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no 
BOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cellmates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was 

common practice in the BOP for prisoners coming off of suicide watch to be assigned a cellmate.  The SHU 
Lieutenant confirmed that a BOP psychologist told him that Epstein had to be housed with a cellmate when 
Epstein returned to the SHU and said that he passed the directive down to the SHU staff. 
Additionally, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9, 2019, said he and all other SHU staff were 
aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement.  MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG 
that MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during 
staff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required 
staff training. 
Forensic Psychologist 1 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, she was present during a meeting in which one 
of Epstein’s attorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate.  Forensic Psychologist 1 said she explained to the 
attorney that Epstein needed to have a cellmate because he was housed in the SHU and he was a 
sex offender. 
VI. 
Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological Observation 
The Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, vetted those inmates, and 
provided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden.  The Warden told the OIG that he identified two 
potential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3.  The Warden said he passed this information on to 
the BOP Director’s Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be 
Epstein’s cellmate. 
The Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-vetted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York.  The 
Warden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would 
have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an 
appropriate inmate.  According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC 
New York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain, 
who would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin. 
VII. 
Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 30 to August 10 
As a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 30, 2019, following his release from psychological 
observation, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Z04-206 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.26  A BOP 
SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, 
and programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological observation cell to the SHU 
occurred the previous day (July 29, 2019).  The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to 
the SHU on July 29, 2019, but, at his request, he remained on psychological observation until July 30, 2019. 
SENTRY was not updated to reflect either the actual date of Epstein’s transfer back into the SHU or the cell to which he 
and Inmate 3 were assigned after the initial cell change necessitated by the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.  
The administrative error in BOP’s SENTRY records regarding Epstein’s cell assignment had no effect on the events the 
OIG investigated and reviewed. 
According to OIG interviews with MCC New York staff members, it does not appear that there were any checks to ensure 
        Continued 

medical record note reflected that, on this same date, Epstein was provided with his personally-owned 
medical device.  BOP witnesses told the OIG that on that same date, Epstein and Inmate 3 were moved to 
cell Z06-220 in the L Tier of the SHU to accommodate the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.  Of all 
the cells in the SHU, cell Z06-220 was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately 15 feet away. 
Inmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell Z06-220 in the L Tier, 
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who 
would not bother Inmate 3.  Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the 
bottom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new 
cellmate slept on the floor.  Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that 
sleeping on the floor was not allowed and he had previously been disciplined for doing so. 
When Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch 
Operations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3.  Inmate 3 said 
he knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch.  According to Inmate 3, 
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3 
should keep an eye on him.  Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to 
serve as a suicide prevention advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.  
Inmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment. 
According to Inmate 3, COs brought two mattresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.  
Epstein put the mattresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door 
window when the cell door is closed.  Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate 
said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets. 
Inmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate 
because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon.  Epstein told Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not 
going to cause Inmate 3 any trouble. 
that inmates were physically located in the cells to which they were assigned in SENTRY.  Associate Warden 1 told the 
OIG that the error would have been identified if SHU staff members had conducted a bed-book count, but there was no 
requirement to do a bed-book count every certain number of days.  Associate Warden 1 explained that during a bed-
book count, the staff members have a roster with them while conducting the count of inmates assigned to their housing 
unit to ensure all inmates are accounted for and in their assigned cells.  The OIG’s investigation revealed that these and 
other cell assignment and recordkeeping errors would have been uncovered had MCC New York SHU staff been 
undertaking inmate accountability measures, such as rounds, counts, census checks, and bed-book checks.

VIII. 
Psychological Evaluations of Epstein from July 6 to August 9 
During Epstein’s detention at MCC New York, a variety of medical professionals, including a Medical Doctor, 
a Clinical Nurse, and Physician Assistant 1, who is a Mid-Level Practitioner, conducted multiple medical 
appointments with Epstein, and Epstein was prescribed a variety of medications for various ailments and 
health needs.  Epstein was also given an eye and dental exam, as well as a blood panel screening.  This 
section details Epstein’s psychological evaluations while he was in MCC New York custody prior to his death. 
On Saturday, July 6, 2019, at 9:38 p.m., upon Epstein’s intake into MCC New York, he was medically screened 
by Physician Assistant 2.  The screening included taking vital signs and asking various medical history 
questions, including questions related to Epstein’s mental health.  Among other things, Physician Assistant 2 
annotated that Epstein did not have current suicidal ideation and had denied having a history of suicide 
attempts.  Physician Assistant 2 instructed Epstein how he could obtain medical, dental, and mental 
health care. 
At 2:58 a.m. on Sunday, July 7, 2019, a Facilities Assistant emailed the Psychology Department asking that 
someone evaluate Epstein because he appeared “distraught, sad, and a little confused.” 
On July 8, 2019, Forensic Psychologist 1 of the Psychology Department conducted an Intake Screening of 
Epstein that included a self-report, staff observation, and a review of information in SENTRY.  Forensic 

Psychologist 1 noted that during Physician Assistant 1’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire, 
Epstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.  
Additionally, Forensic Psychologist 1 noted no suicidal ideations, attempts, or self-harm; no history of 
substance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions. 
During the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,” 
and that he was currently charged with sex trafficking.  Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts 
and denied passive or active suicidal ideation.  It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations 
were future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking. 
According to Forensic Psychologist 1, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and 
was designated as Mental Health Care Code 1.  This is indicative of an inmate who does not show any 
significant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need 
for regular mental health intervention.  Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the 
Psychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department 
services in the future. 
The MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake 
Questionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.27  Code 1 means there are no concerns about 
the inmate’s mental health status; they have no needs and will not be followed up with unless requested by 
staff or the inmates.  Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them 
under control and the Psychology Department will follow up monthly.  Code 3 is more severe, requiring 
weekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved 
to observation.  Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant 
psychological observation.  The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code 1 inmate can be on suicide watch.  
Suicide watch is for inmates who are showing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal. 
Subsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2019, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National 
Suicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated 
with Epstein for suicidality.  These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with 
media attention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for 
bad news from a court proceeding that day.  A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from 
court, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk 
assessment could be conducted. 
When Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted 
the Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality.  However, for precautionary 
reasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could 
conduct a suicide risk assessment the following day.  During Epstein’s period of psychological observation, 
inmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in 15-minute 
increments.  Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate 
Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,” 
not “codes.” 

companion program at an institution to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised 
by the institution’s Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. 
On July 9, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein.  She reviewed Epstein’s 
medical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.  
Epstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any 
history of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms.  The Chief Psychologist’s 
assessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide.  The 
Chief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as 
negative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.  
The Chief Psychologist’s assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his 
risk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case.  Epstein remained on 
psychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a 
suicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report. 
On July 10, 2019, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that, 
according to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and 
interacting with other inmates.  During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns 
over being housed in the SHU.  Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be 
housed in the SHU and had also requested a shower, his property, pen, and paper.  The Chief Psychologist 
stated Epstein had been provided a shower on this date.  She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies, 
to which he was receptive.  Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein 
stated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release.  The Chief 
Psychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be 
released from the psychological observation area.  She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with 
a cellmate and would be seen the following morning to evaluate his mental status and stability.  Following 
this July 10 assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with 
documented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department. 
The following day, July 11, 2019, the Staff Psychologist attempted to see Epstein in the morning and 
afternoon, but he was meeting with his attorneys.  Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with 
Epstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the attorney conference area for a psychological 
observation follow-up.  During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues, 
including not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his attorney conference, and a 
desire to attend recreation.  Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief 
Psychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU.  During this 
clinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was 
receptive.  Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the 
Psychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the 
Psychology Department.  Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan and was 

scheduled to be seen again the following week.  The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that Epstein and his 
attorney mocked her for thinking Epstein was suicidal.28 
On July 16, 2019, at Epstein’s request, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein during his attorney 
conference.  The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied 
suicidality.  The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding 
additional coping strategies.  Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact 
Psychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him.  The 
Chief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follow-up and that Epstein 
would be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews. 
According to the BOP After Action Review submitted by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief 
Psychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July 16, 2019, at Epstein’s request during his attorney conference was 
inappropriate.  The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein attempted to “bring his 
attorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.”  In the 
After Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide 
psychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet 
with an inmate’s attorney.  When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that 
the intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security. 
On July 18, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was 
unavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would attempt to interview Epstein in the near 
future to complete his monthly review. 
As noted previously, at approximately 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his 
cell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck.  The Chief Psychologist made a general 
administrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately 
a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely 
hanging around his neck.  That morning, Physician Assistant 1 assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in 
BOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented.  According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein 
did not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment.  Epstein said he did not know 
what had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck.  Physician Assistant 1 noted that Epstein 
had a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-
thirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck.  According to the BOP report, one 
section of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no 
inflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness.  The BOP report stated that Epstein was 
able to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory 
problems.  Physician Assistant 1 further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s 
left knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild.  Physician Assistant 1’s assessment was 
that the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted. 
Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s attorneys were not “mocking” her; 
the attorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and 
dismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal. 

Also on July 23, 2019, the Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment that included a clinical 
interview of Epstein and a review of Epstein’s medical record, the psychology data system, and a review of 
the SENTRY database.  According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knowing why he was 
placed on suicide watch.  BOP records state that Epstein recalled getting a drink of water the night prior and 
then went back to bed.  Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring.  The BOP assessment 
records reflect that Epstein wanted to know why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had 
been found with a string on his neck.  The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had 
placed the string around his neck or if someone else did.  Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm 
thoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide attempts; and denied 
feeling hopeless and fearing for his safety.  Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and 
that his future plans included fighting his criminal case and getting back to his normal life.  The Staff 
Psychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation.  The Staff 
Psychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate. 
The Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident:  (1) Epstein 
and/or Inmate 1 were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not getting; 
(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate 1 had assaulted Epstein.  The 
Chief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate 
he originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate 1) was 
less plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not know for certain. 
The following day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately 1:08 p.m., and observed that the 
central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion.  Epstein told the medical staff that he still 
did not want to talk about how he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to 
do with it.  BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether 
Epstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted. 
On July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch.  Epstein remained 
in the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 30, 
2019.29  Also on July 24, 2019, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report.  According to 
Forensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding how he sustained 
the scar around his neck.  The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation, 
intentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was 
assessed for a willingness to engage in treatment.  The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2 
inquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying 
to remember.  Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had 
tried to kill him but was now claiming he has no memory of the incident.  Epstein told Forensic 
Psychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cellmate tying a string or rope around his neck. 
Following Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from 
suicide watch.  Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein down to 
psychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both 
Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU 
on July 30, 2019; however, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2019. 

concurred with her determination.  Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on 
psychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by 
inmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff.  Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in 
the Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein 
stating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it 
would be crazy to take his own life and he would not do that to himself.  Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI 
that following her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2019, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his 
self-reporting of what had occurred the previous day.  Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed 
signs of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.”  Nevertheless, she was not comfortable 
taking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was 
a step down from suicide watch.  Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the 
consent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted.  Forensic 
Psychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation allowed him to possess hygiene 
products, two novels, attend legal visits, and take showers.  It also allowed him to have standard inmate 
clothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant.  However, Forensic Psychologist 2 
explained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they 
are re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 
According to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being 
housed in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for 
him to be housed.  Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological 
observation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal 
to remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time.  The BOP report states that Epstein 
was again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. 
According to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2019, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the 
Staff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation.  On each of these dates, according to BOP 
reports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on 
July 23, 2019, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch.  Additionally, on each date, Epstein was 
provided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive.  BOP records state that 
Epstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he 
could not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.  
The Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2019, and he was in 
good spirits.  She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2019 incident 
and asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember.  The Chief Psychologist told 
the OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions 
regarding the possible suicide attempt.  The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the 
BOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex 
offender in the SHU.  The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.  
BOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2019, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist 
that he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise 
was similar to when he was housed in the SHU.  The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be 
moving to a different cell. 
On July 29, 2019, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of 
the July 23, 2019 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.  On this date, Epstein was to receive 

his personally owned medical device.  BOP records state that Epstein was aware he would be returning to 
the SHU but reported that he did not feel well due to lack of sleep and other medical concerns.  Epstein 
asked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and 
then return to the SHU with a cellmate the following day.  According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist 
informed Epstein that he could stay 1 more night and explained that there were no mental health issues 
precluding him from returning to the SHU the following day.  The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein 
that he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU.  Epstein again was provided supportive interventions 
and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies.  BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat 
receptive but more concerned with getting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns. 
On July 30, 2019, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept 
well, and Epstein discussed how he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the 
noise.  The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed 
Epstein had eaten and taken a shower the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 30.  The 
Staff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content 
and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation.  BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to 
immediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-
oriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself.  The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact 
report that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein 
would be discontinued.  According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein 
about routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that 
Epstein would be seen the following day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if 
needed.  The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein 
needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. 
Also on July 30, 2019, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being 
able to proceed with the disciplinary process.  Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act, 
specifically tattooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2019.  In conducting the 
evaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the 
Chief Psychologist on July 9, 2019, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and 
having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.  The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the 
suicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2019, which stated that it was unclear at 
the time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else.  According to 
the Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 30, the determination of an inmate’s 
competency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s 
ability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her own defense.  
After a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the 
Staff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process. 
That same day, July 30, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the 
SHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day. 
On July 31, 2019, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein 
and noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was getting readjusted to being in the 
SHU.  Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was getting along with his cellmate.  According to her 
report, Epstein explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation or intent and denied having thoughts of 

harming others.  Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or 
psychological distress.  Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her 
utilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques.  She wrote that there did not appear to be a need 
for follow-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if 
needed.  According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and 
SHU reviews. 
On August 1, 2019, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for 
processing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when 
the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided 
a form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.”  The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner 
Schedule Report for July 31, 2019, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in 
the remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns:  Suicidal Tendencies.”  The Chief Psychologist told the OIG 
that the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was 
previously on suicide watch.  Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since 
Epstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on 
suicide watch. 
Following receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist 
conducted a suicide risk assessment on August 1 that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical 
encounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems.  According to 
the Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form 
noted that he had suicidal tendencies.  The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident 
report he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged.  The OIG 
confirmed that the incident report was expunged.  Epstein also said his cellmate talked at night and kept 
Epstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another 
cellmate.  The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to 
himself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had 
any of these thoughts.  Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had 
reasons to live and positive future plans.  The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently 
psychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time.  The Staff Psychologist 
concluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was low, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.  
Epstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and 
emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.  The Staff Psychologist’s report noted 
that Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be 
seen by Psychology Department staff the following week to monitor his mental status and provide further 
intervention, if needed. 
On August 8, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follow-up session with Epstein.  According to 
her report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population.  The 
report further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation, 
intention, or plan.  Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to 
make phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly 
phone contact.  The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and 
did not appear to be in any distress.  The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any 
unusual behaviors related to Epstein.  She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and 

psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies, to which Epstein was receptive.  Epstein was 
educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and also 
reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him.  The Chief Psychologist wrote that 
Epstein would be seen in weekly SHU rounds and monthly for SHU reviews.  The Chief Psychologist told the 
OIG that the fact that Epstein underwent three suicide risk assessments was unusual.30 
Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that it was not unusual for someone with static risk 
factors like Epstein to have received multiple suicide risk assessments.  According to the Chief Psychologist upon 
reviewing a draft of this report, what was unusual was the fact that Epstein was in attorney conference “day and night 
on a daily basis due to his financial resources.”  She noted that it was difficult for Psychology Department staff to 
interview Epstein because he had a right to his attorney visits, which would last throughout the working day. 

Chapter 5:  The Events of August 8–10, 2019, and Epstein’s Death 
I. 
Epstein Signs a New Last Will and Testament on August 8 
In the weeks following Epstein’s death, multiple media outlets reported that Epstein signed a new Last Will 
and Testament on August 8, 2019.  At least one media organization published a copy of the notarized 
document showing that it was signed by Epstein and two of his attorneys and notarized on August 8, 2019.  
Attorney visitor logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York) 
confirmed that those attorneys and the notary public visited Epstein on that date.  The Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) confirmed via court records that the August 8, 2019 will and other probate-related 
documents were filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands on August 15, 2019.  Among the court filings 
was an affidavit from another attorney who stated that she received the August 8, 2019 will from Epstein.  
The OIG confirmed via attorney visitor logs that this attorney also visited Epstein at MCC New York on 
August 8, 2019.  The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that MCC New York personnel were unaware 
that Epstein had changed his will 2 days before he died. 
The Chief Psychologist said she had heard that Epstein had changed his will from media reporting following 
his death.  The Chief Psychologist did not know if the media reporting was accurate, but she thought that if 
it were true, it would have been useful information to know because it would have been a red flag.  The Staff 
Psychologist and the Chief Psychologist told the OIG that if Epstein’s attorneys had notified them or the 
Psychology Department that Epstein had changed his will, such information would have been a factor 
warranting a review of Epstein’s mental state and Epstein probably would have been placed back on suicide 
watch or some type of observation. 
II. 
Court Order on August 9 Releasing Epstein-Related Documents in Pending 
Civil Litigation 
On August 9, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of the summary 
judgment filings from a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged that 
Epstein had victimized her when she was a teenager, against Ghislaine Maxwell.31  As a result of the court’s 
order, that same day approximately 2,000 pages of documents were released into the public domain, which 
contained considerable derogatory information about Epstein and some may have related to the criminal 
charges pending against him.  Additional high-profile public figures were also named in the released 
documents.  There was significant media coverage of information contained within the unsealed 
court filings. 
Maxwell was subsequently indicted and, in December 2021, convicted of conspiring with Epstein to sexually 
abuse minors. 

III. 
Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure 
to Replace Him with Another Inmate 
A. 
Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 
As noted above, since July 30, consistent with the Psychology Department’s determination that Epstein 
needed to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate.  At 10:33 a.m. on 
August 8, 2019, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to 
Receiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for 
processing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC 
New York] to GEO.”32  The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred 
and further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/19.” 
At 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel, 
including Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the 
Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the 
Special Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production 08-09-2019.”  This email 
contained two attachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9, 
2019.  The first page of this attachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC 
New York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2019.  This attachment also includes the acronym 
“WAB” within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the 
OIG means “with all belongings.”  During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further 
explained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC 
New York on August 9, 2019.  Notwithstanding this email, as detailed below, several of the email recipients 
identified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities 
Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not know 
he had been transferred to another facility. 
B. 
MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Attorney’s Request that Epstein be Housed 
Without a Cellmate 
Forensic Psychologist 1 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, she was present during a meeting in which one 
of Epstein’s attorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate.  Forensic Psychologist 1 explained to the attorney 
that because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate. 
Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Attorney 
with the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on 
the previous day (August 9, 2019), two of Epstein’s attorneys separately contacted him.  One of the attorneys 
asked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other attorney 
asked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU.  The Supervisory Staff Attorney said he 
informed the first attorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as 
GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is 
managed by The GEO Group, Inc. 

Epstein, and he said he told the second attorney that Epstein could not be housed without a cellmate 
because of his prior suicide attempt. 
C. 
Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York 
According to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2019, at 
approximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC 
New York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer.  The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC 
New York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant’s Log to document the daily 
activities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts. 
The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9, 
2019, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day.  The 
Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the 
USMS emails sent on August 8, 2019, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since 
Inmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and 
not coming back.  She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial 
inmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-
remove.”  Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who 
entered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC 
New York on or before the morning of August 9, 2019.  The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told 
the OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports 
(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York. 
The OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who 
handled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2019.  The Correctional Systems 
Officer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2019, at 
8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison.  She explained to 
the OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information 
regarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving 
their MCC New York housing units.  Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call 
out list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved.  The Correctional 
Systems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2019, was no longer available because the 
call out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units 
at the end of the day.  She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour 
period, and then it was updated (overwritten) with the next day’s list.  In her OIG interview, the Correctional 
Systems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience.  Receiving and 
Discharge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2019, which the MCC 
New York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility.  Based on the 
other records reflecting Inmate 3’s transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for 
August 9, 2019, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from 
the institution and not returning. 
Correctional Officer (CO) 1 told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2019, he and Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit. 

D. 
Failure to Assign Epstein a New Cellmate on August 9 
1. Day Watch Staff Actions on August 9 
The SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that he worked at MCC New York on August 8, 2019, from approximately 
a.m. until approximately 2 p.m., and that he was off on August 9, 2019.  The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift 
ended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3’s impending transfer, told 
the OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and 
therefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate.  According to the SHU 
Lieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a 
Lieutenant on duty.  The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the 
OIG that on August 9, 2019, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to 
their position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence. 
According to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2019, SHU Officer #1 was listed as Senior Officer 
Specialist 5.  Although SHU Officer #1 is typically the Officer in Charge, another Senior Officer Specialist told 
the OIG that, in actuality, he was the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 from approximately 
a.m. until 2 p.m.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that since he had the most experience and 
seniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge, which the SHU Lieutenant 
confirmed.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a 
cellmate.  He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or 
psychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate.  He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant 
had instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times.  According to the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge, between July 30 and August 9, 2019, he told all other MCC New York staff members 
who worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in 
the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knowledge, training, 
and experience. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2019, the SHU staff 
received an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was 
being removed from MCC New York.  He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted 
Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time 
Epstein joked around with him.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were 
accompanied by CO 1, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge.  The Day Watch SHU Officer 
in Charge and CO 1 both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his 
belongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that 
he would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a 
cellmate.  In his interview with the OIG, CO 1 confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications 
made either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the 
OIG that when he and CO 1 left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations 
Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’ 
Office and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York, 
there had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal, 
only to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances.  According to the Day 

Watch SHU Officer in Charge, he did not select a new cellmate for Epstein because he was not certain that 
Inmate 3 had been discharged from the institution, although he assumed that Inmate 3 would not return to 
the SHU.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when his shift ended at approximately 
p.m., he informed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Senior Officer Specialist 5 that, if Inmate 3 
did not return to the SHU, Epstein would need a new cellmate upon Epstein’s return from his attorney visit.  
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he specifically recalled telling the Evening Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge, in the presence of Senior Officer Specialist 5, “Make sure this guy gets a bunkie,” to which the 
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge replied, “All right.”  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that, at 
some point that day, it was likely that he also informed the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, but he could 
not specifically recall if he had done so. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that a replacement cellmate should have been identified 
as soon as it was confirmed that Inmate 3 had left the institution.  He said a new cellmate could have been 
reassigned before the 4 p.m. SHU count if it was known that Inmate 3 was not coming back, but the SHU 
staff members had until Epstein returned from his attorney visit to assign Epstein a new cellmate.  
According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, SHU staff definitely should have realized that Inmate 3 
was not returning both during the 4 p.m. count and when Epstein returned from his attorney visit later that 
evening.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine was that he would 
be with his attorneys in the attorney conference room until approximately 8 p.m., so SHU personnel had 
time to make a new cellmate assignment.  He said all SHU staff members shared the responsibility to find a 
replacement cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found another inmate to replace 
Inmate 3.  However, he also said that due to Epstein’s high profile, the SHU personnel should have asked a 
Lieutenant to contact the Psychology Department to see which inmate should be placed with Epstein. 
On August 12, 2019, following Epstein’s death, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge wrote a memorandum 
to the Warden stating, “On Friday August 9, 2019 at approximately 1:50 p.m., I S/O/S [the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge] passed on to oncoming staff member [the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge] and 
present shift staff [Senior Officer Specialist 5] and [CO 2] that Inmate [3] was going WAB [i.e., with all of his 
belongings] and possibly may not return.  Also that Inmate Epstein #76318-054 will be needing a cell mate 
upon arrival from his attorney visit.”  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge departed the SHU at 
approximately 2 p.m. and worked an overtime shift as a driver for MCC New York.  He stated that he did not 
follow up with the SHU staff to verify that Epstein had been assigned another cellmate. 
MCC New York staff with responsibility for oversight and staffing of the SHU during the Day Watch, including 
the Warden, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, 
the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, told the OIG that they all 
knew Epstein was required to have a cellmate pursuant to the Psychology Department’s determination.  
They also confirmed that everyone who regularly worked in the SHU knew of this requirement, and that it 
was the responsibility of all SHU staff to notify a supervisor upon learning that Epstein needed to be 
assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer to another prison.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge 
and CO 1, however, were the only two MCC New York staff members working the Day Watch on August 9, 
2019, who told the OIG that they were aware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new 
cellmate.  CO 1’s immediate superior (the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge) was already aware of the need 
to assign Epstein a new cellmate.  While the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he made a 
number of notifications, other witnesses could not confirm that he had passed on information regarding 
Epstein’s need for a new cellmate. 

The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they 
did not know Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of 
the second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3’s impending 
transfer out of MCC New York on August 9.  Rather, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day 
Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York 
for a court appearance. 
The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant did not recall Inmate 3 departing the institution with all of his 
belongings or having any conversations with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge or anyone else regarding 
Inmate 3’s departure from MCC New York.  According to the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, he did not 
know that Epstein was without a cellmate.  Other senior officials, including the Warden, Associate Warden 1, 
and the Captain, were also unaware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.  
These officials concurred that while all SHU staff and supervisors were responsible for notifying a supervisor 
in the chain-of-command of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge 
bore primary responsibility for the notification because he was the SHU Officer in Charge and one of two 
people who saw Inmate 3 leave the facility with all of his belongings.  The Captain told the OIG that since 
Epstein was in the attorney conference room all day, no one may have even thought about it, and may have 
only become aware when they put Epstein back in his cell after his attorney visit that evening.  The Captain 
said as soon as the SHU staff became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate, they should have notified 
the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant.  The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have 
taken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that 
assignment occurred.  The Captain, however, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that 
notified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s transfer to another facility.  The Warden 
and Associate Warden 1 did not receive this email. 
The Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2019.  The Warden said that in the event Epstein 
was without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but 
that no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred. 
2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 
from approximately 2 p.m. until 10 p.m.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a 
Material Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he 
began his shift, Epstein was visiting with his attorneys in the attorney conference room.  The Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate.  When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t 
necessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but I don’t remember him speaking to me about this.  So, 
maybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe I was standing there, and he thought I heard 
him.”  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his 
belongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required 
to have a cellmate. 

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he eventually learned later that evening that 
Epstein did not have a cellmate.  According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after Epstein 
returned from his attorney visit and placed a telephone call, he escorted Epstein to his cell and saw that 
Inmate 3 was not there.  According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that 
Epstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU 
that evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein.  In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that 
Epstein did not have a cellmate.  OIG interviews did not identify an individual who received such a call or 
who witnessed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge making it. 
Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from approximately 8:45 a.m. 
until 4 p.m.  Senior Officer Specialist 5 said when he reported for duty, Epstein was already with his 
attorneys, Inmate 3 had already left the SHU, and neither inmate returned to the SHU prior to his departure.  
Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that he did not know Inmate 3 had been released from MCC 
New York and that no one told him Epstein would need a new cellmate, including the Day Watch SHU Officer 
in Charge, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, or anyone from the Psychology Department. 
CO 2 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m.  CO 2 said he did not 
recall Inmate 3 departing the SHU that day, and that he was unaware that Epstein needed a new cellmate. 
The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant at the MCC 
on August 9 from approximately 2 p.m. until 10 p.m.  The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he was 
aware that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to a mass email that was sent to all of the MCC 
New York Lieutenants.  According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, everyone who regularly 
worked in the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate.  The Evening Watch 
Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not know Inmate 3 had left MCC New York earlier that day 
and was unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate.  He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to 
Receiving and Discharge as “WAB” and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have 
been notified.  The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his 
shift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed.  The OIG’s 
investigation revealed, however, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of 
the USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC 
New York on August 9.  According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch 
Activities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have 
known that Epstein was without a cellmate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the 
SHU tiers during the round.  The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he believed that if the Evening 
Watch Acting Activities Lieutenant knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate, she would have notified him. 
Both the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the 
OIG that they were unaware that Epstein needed to have a cellmate.  The Acting Evening Watch Activities 
Lieutenant, who was serving in this position on August 9 from approximately 4 p.m. until 10 p.m., told the 
OIG that because her ordinary position was a Senior Officer Specialist, she was not aware that Epstein was 
required to have a cellmate.  The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant recalled hearing that Epstein 
had been placed on suicide watch, but said she never received specific instructions regarding Epstein.  She 
said the SHU staff did not tell her about the requirement that Epstein have a cellmate or that his cellmate 

had left MCC New York.  The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not receive the August 8 USMS 
email regarding Inmate 3’s transfer.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, who was the Operations 
Lieutenant from approximately 10 p.m. on August 9 until 6 a.m. on August 10, told the OIG that she did not 
know that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and that the Captain never spoke with her about this 
issue.  The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that 
Epstein needed a cellmate; however, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations 
Lieutenant should have known of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the 
Psychology Department on July 30, 2019, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an 
appropriate cellmate.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email 
notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York.  The 
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate 
and did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on 
August 10, as part of her Lieutenant rounds. 
The Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not attended SHU training, but he 
had worked in the SHU approximately 10 to 20 times.  According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he 
reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
shift in the warehouse.  At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and 
asked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed.  The Material Handler said 
he worked the 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.  
The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him 
working 24 hours straight, from 12 a.m. on August 9 through 12 a.m. on August 10.  After the Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge left at 10 p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the 
SHU from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.  The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting 
with his attorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned 
to his cell on L Tier.  After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said 
they left the L Tier area.  The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that 
Epstein needed a cellmate. 
Noel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on 
August 10, which was a double shift of 16 hours.  Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time 
that Epstein was housed within the SHU.  According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU 
were typically assigned cellmates, but she did not know if they were required to have cellmates.  Noel said 
Epstein was assigned a cellmate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her 
about a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate.  Noel said she did not know that Inmate 3 had been 
removed from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been 
assigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York. 
Material Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August 10 from 12 a.m. 
until 8 a.m.  Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous 
previous occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures.  Thomas said he knew that if 
an inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he 
said he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological observation.  
Therefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with 
him about that requirement.  Thomas said the SHU staff should have notified the Operations Lieutenant as 
soon as they knew that Epstein’s cellmate had departed MCC New York on August 9.  However, Thomas said 

he did not know that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and that Epstein was without 
a cellmate during his shift on August 10. 
IV. 
Epstein is Allowed to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9 
For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the 
Inmate Telephone System.  BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone 
call to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on 
August 9, 2019, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:19 p.m.  No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call, 
including identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation.  The OIG found no evidence that 
Epstein signed an Acknowledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to 
use a non-Inmate Telephone System line.  The Acknowledgement of Inmate form provides, among other 
things, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-attorney conversations on any 
telephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution 
and to protect the public.  The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York’s 
Special Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the 
telephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief 
statement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires. 
The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back 
to the SHU from the attorney conference room on August 9, 2019, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch 
Operations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity 
to place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their 
attorneys.  The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death.  The Northeast 
Regional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on 
non-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present. 
The Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call 
from the SHU on August 9, 2019, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call 
since Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls.  The Captain 
explained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his attorney visit back to the SHU, he told 
the Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be 
monitored and logged. 
The Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.  The Unit 
Manager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that 
Epstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for 
various reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his attorneys during normal working hours.  As 
described below, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that allowed him to place 
calls through the Inmate Telephone System.  The Unit Manager said the decision to allow Epstein to place 
the call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was 
representing the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time.  The Unit Manager said 
he did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permitting Epstein to make the call, and he 
would have allowed the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the 
Unit Manager.  The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as 

a part of his job, and he would allow inmates to place telephone calls if they were unable to make calls 
under ordinary circumstances. 
The Unit Manager told the OIG that at approximately 6:45 p.m., he and Senior Officer Specialist 1 escorted 
Epstein from the attorney conference room to the SHU so that Epstein could place a telephone call.  The 
Unit Manager said he put Epstein in the shower area to make the telephone call because COs were present 
in that area.  The Unit Manager explained that he also chose the shower area because that location ensured 
Epstein would not be able to pull the phone cord into his cell and use it to harm himself.  The Unit Manager 
said he plugged the telephone line into the legal line, which was not recorded, and dialed the telephone 
number that Epstein provided.  As noted above, the number that was dialed was in the local 646 area code.  
The Unit Manager said he allowed Epstein to place the telephone call on the unrecorded legal line because 
he believed that Epstein had not set up his Inmate Telephone System account that would have allowed him 
to call on the institutions recorded lines.  According to the Unit Manager, a male answered, and the Unit 
Manager handed the receiver to Epstein.  The Unit Manager heard Epstein say, “Hey, how are you doing?  
How’s everything?”  The Unit Manager admitted that he should have verified who was on the line, as Epstein 
had requested to make a telephone call to speak with his mother, and it was a male who answered the 
phone.  The Unit Manager said he could not verify the phone number because he believed that Epstein did 
not have his Inmate Telephone System account set up, and he did not have any phone numbers associated 
with his account.  The Unit Manager told the OIG that after he handed the telephone to Epstein, his shift 
ended so he left the SHU and left MCC New York for the day. 
The Unit Manager said that when he left the SHU, Epstein was still on the call and the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge and Noel were at the officers’ desk, and that Senior Officer Specialist 1 was also present.  
According to the Unit Manager, when he was leaving, he told the officers, “Hey, make sure he gets his 15-
minutes, and after that, he’s done.”  The Unit Manager said he did not provide the SHU staff with 
instructions to monitor the call.  He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and 
asked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up. 
The Unit Manager acknowledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done.  The Unit 
Manager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to 
bring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front.  The 
Unit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member 
present, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored. 
The OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to 
public records, died in 2004.  The OIG found that Epstein actually spoke with Individual 1, who declined to be 
interviewed by the OIG.33  Individual 1’s lawyer told the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York during an attorney proffer that Individual 1 spoke with Epstein on August 9, 2019, at about 7 p.m., 
for approximately 20 minutes.  Individual 1’s attorney proffer was that Individual 1 was in the country of 
Belarus at the time of the call.34  Individual 1’s attorney told the U.S. Attorney’s Office that during the 
The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not Department of 
Justice employees. 
The OIG did not investigate the factual accuracy of this proffer.  We note that there are methods by which a call to the 
646 area code could connect to a telephone in Belarus. 

telephone call, Epstein told Individual 1 that the press had gotten crazy, and they discussed personal things 
such as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated.  According to the representations by Individual 1’s 
counsel, Epstein told Individual 1, “They are trying to keep me safe,” and that his case would take a little 
longer than he originally thought.  He told Individual 1 he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be 
able to call her again for another month. 
Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had 
previously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that 
allowed him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG 
that Epstein was issued the necessary documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate 1 was his 
cellmate.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 also advised the OIG about an interaction that he had with one of 
Epstein’s attorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the attorney.  According 
to Senior Officer Specialist 1, Epstein’s attorney asked him about getting Epstein the necessary 
documentation to make calls.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 said he then verified that Epstein was able to make 
calls through the Inmate Telephone System.  When Senior Officer Specialist 1 asked Epstein why he had said 
he was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.”  Senior 
Officer Specialist 1 said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s attorney, the attorney asked how 
Epstein could get an unmonitored call.  Senior Officer Specialist 1 told Epstein’s attorney that decision had to 
be made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager. 
Noel told the OIG that after Epstein’s attorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a 
telephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shower area within the SHU where he was afforded a 
telephone call.  The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside 
of the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and 
therefore is not recorded.  Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU 
and did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knowledge, to monitor Epstein’s call.  According to Noel, 
the call was not monitored or logged.  Noel said that approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, while Epstein 
was still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s 
time was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein.  Noel estimated that Epstein’s call 
lasted for 20 minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also 
present in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call.  Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein, 
left Epstein alone in the shower, and went to use the bathroom on 10 South.  Noel said that upon her 
return, Epstein was already placed back in his cell. 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during 
the time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation.  The Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by 
the actions of another inmate.  The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or 
Epstein in the shower area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knowledge or information 
regarding a phone call made by Epstein that night. 
The Northeast Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York 
official, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and 
the call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created.  The Northeast Regional 
Director said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t know 

what happened on that phone call.  It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein’s death], but we 
don’t, we will never know.” 
V. 
Failure to Conduct SHU Inmate Counts and Staff Rounds on August 9–-10 
A. 
SHU Inmate Counts 
As detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to 
conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all 
inmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility.  Performing an 
institutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO’s job, and the count was one of the basic 
and essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York.  The Captain told the OIG that counts are 
a core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates.  The Evening Watch Operations 
Lieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is how staff 
members know if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped. 
On weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and 10 p.m.  
The 10 p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were 
counted.  Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform 
the institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU.  To perform the institutional count in the 
SHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to 
observe and count each individual inmate.  During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the 
other officer observed the inmates.  The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count 
numbers.  If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.  
COs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred 
to as a count slip.35 
On the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the 
total number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and 
signed the count slip.  Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then 
collected and delivered to the Control Center.  Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for 
comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution’s inmate roster to ensure that each 
inmate was accounted for.  Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the 
numbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be 
deemed “cleared” or completed.  If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number 
of inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a 
more intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are 
counted using their picture cards.  Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were 
provided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York. 
The OIG’s investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 
2019.  Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds after 
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.  As a

result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology 
Department had determined was necessary, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an 
extended period of time. 
1. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9 
The OIG’s investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2019, was inaccurate 
because SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a 
predetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time.  However, Epstein, who was in the 
SHU attorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.  
The OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at 
p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU.  The SHU inmate count was not 
corrected until 12 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional 
count and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at 
that time. 
Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he 
told the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be.  In addition, the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of 
inmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time. 
When interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from 
August 9, 2019, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel.  Based on his 
review, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and 
Noel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU.  He said they likely wrote down the numbers they 
thought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate 
(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another 
housing unit.  According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon 
the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 attempt to retrieve an unknown item from his 
visitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room.  The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2019, reflected that 
following this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:15 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving 
and Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are 
believed to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person.  According to the Day Watch SHU Officer 
in Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and 
went by the cheat sheet because the body wasn’t even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred 
from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the 
p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the 
SHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU. 
In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknowledged that neither he nor 
any other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer 
in Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had 
prepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day.  The 
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m. 

count slip.36  During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP documents 
regarding the inmate’s transfer from the SHU and acknowledged further that based on that transfer, the 
number of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submitted for the 4 p.m. count, the count slip 
was incorrect. 
Noel admitted in the deferred prosecution agreement she entered into with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of New York that she completed false count slips on August 9 and 10.  Noel initially told 
the OIG that she did not conduct the 4 p.m. count on August 9, but after acknowledging that she signed the 
p.m. SHU count slip, Noel said she did not recall if she conducted the count.  According to Noel, she and 
other SHU staff filled out the count slip before conducting the counts because they knew the number of 
inmates they were supposed to report. 
2. The 10 p.m. SHU Count on August 9 
At the time of the 10 p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in 
their cells for the night.  At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for 
conducting the 10 p.m. stand up count.  At 10 p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel 
and the Material Handler.  Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness 
statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the 10 p.m. 
count in the SHU.37  Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler completed and signed the 10 p.m. SHU 
count slip.  The 10 p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + 1.”  According to the MCC 
New York master count sheet for the 10 p.m. count on August 9, 2019, all units had verbally reported their 
inmate counts to the Control Center by 10:30 p.m.38  At approximately 10:36 p.m., the Control Center 
completed all paperwork and officially cleared the 10 p.m. institutional count. 
The Material Handler said he was present at the time of the 10 p.m. count, but that the count was not 
conducted because everyone was tired.  The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an 
overtime shift from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m., his regular shift from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., followed by his SHU overtime 
shift from 4 p.m. to midnight.  Thus, at the time of the 10 p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at 
MCC New York.  The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the 10 p.m. count slip and believed 
that Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers.  He did not know why the count slip listed 
“73 + 1”. 
Noel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at 10 p.m. and that the Material Handler 
signed the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her.  However, the OIG’s review and 
analysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the 10 p.m. 
count.  Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between 10:29 p.m. and 10:36 p.m. when Noel 
walked to different tiers inside the SHU.  Yet, as described above, MCC New York records reflect that counts 
from all MCC New York housing units were reported to the Control Center by 10:30 p.m., as the count 
Prosecution was declined for BOP employees (other than Noel and Thomas) who falsely certified inmate counts and 
rounds on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death. 
The quality of the SHU video footage was poor.  Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the OIG analyzed 
witness statements and BOP records to better determine what the video depicted. 
The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.” 

documentation shows the count was verbally cleared by the Control Center at 10:30 p.m.  It therefore 
appears that the video depicts Noel conducting a later round in the SHU, as she was required to do every 
minutes during her shift, and not the 10 p.m. SHU count. 
Noel said she wrote the 73 on the count slip but she did not remember if she or someone else had written 
“+ 1” on the count slip and she did not know why “+1” was on the count slip.  Noel claimed that, unlike the 
p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the 10 p.m. 
count slip in advance of the count.  Noel said she did not know that the 10 p.m. SHU count slip, which listed 
inmates, was inaccurate, and she could not explain why the 12 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that 
inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed 
inmates in the SHU. 
Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, he worked in the Control Center from 
approximately 4 p.m. until 12 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on 
August 10.  According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 10 p.m. institutional count by 
himself in the Control Center, and assisted with the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts on August 10 as an 
Internal Officer.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC New York records reflect, that he 
had received verbal counts from all units by 10:30 p.m., and further stated that he had cleared the 
institutional count at 10:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the count was 
officially complete. 
Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York 10 p.m. institutional count, which showed that the 
SHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned 
to the unit.  When questioned by the OIG about the 10 p.m. SHU count slip that listed “73 + 1” inmates and 
was signed by the Material Handler and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed that 
the “+ 1” on the count slip was in his handwriting.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the 10 p.m. 
Receiving and Discharge count slip, which listed  “9S + 1” on the count slip and told the OIG that it was his 
handwriting.39  Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the “9S + 1” on the SHU count slip meant that he 
was “ghost counting” the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area, 
to the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there 
were, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the 10 p.m. count, he should have written “73 - 1" on 
the SHU count slip rather than “73 + 1”. 
According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section 
of MCC New York.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 did not recall if he wrote on the count slips at the time of the 10 p.m. count or 
during the 12 a.m. count when Inmate 4 was transferred in SENTRY from the SHU to Receiving and 
Discharge.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the 
p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count.  Instead, he should have created a new master count 
sheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the 
inaccurate SHU count slip.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have 
needed to authorize him to do the “ghost count” and write on the count slips, although he could not recall 
precisely who gave him the authorization or when he had done so.  The OIG investigation and review 
determined that the only Operations Lieutenant on duty at the time was the Morning Watch Operations 
Lieutenant, who started her shift at 10 p.m. on August 9.  When questioned by the OIG, the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant adamantly denied having authorized a “ghost count” and the OIG identified no 
record or witness (other than Senior Officer Specialist 6) to indicate that she had done so.  The OIG 
interviewed other MCC New York personnel, who said “ghost counting” was not permitted, and stressed the 
importance of an accurate physical count of inmates. 
3. The 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. SHU Counts on August 10 
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she supervised the August 10 12 a.m. 
institutional count from the Control Center.  During the count, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant 
said she identified the issue with the inaccuracy of the SHU count slip because it counted Inmate 4 as 
present in the SHU, when in actuality he had been removed from the SHU and placed in the Receiving and 
Discharge dry cell the previous day (August 9, 2019).  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that 
after learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in 
SENTRY.  This update is reflected in Inmate 4’s Inmate History Quarters, which states that Inmate 4 was 
transferred out of the SHU into a different housing unit on August 10, 2019, at 12:35 a.m.  The Morning

Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count 
and create a new count slip, but she did not know if they had actually done so. 
During his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate 
transfer, the 12 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips.  Based on his review of this 
material, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the 12 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to 
list 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time.  Senior Officer 
Specialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told 
the OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates. 
At approximately 12 a.m. on August 10, 2019, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material 
Handler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU.  Noel and Thomas were 
responsible for conducting the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU.  Through review and analysis 
of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and 
Thomas did not perform any of these counts.  Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas completed and signed SHU 
count slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the 
a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts at approximately 12:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:30 a.m., 
respectively.  Noel and Thomas both admitted to the OIG that they did not conduct the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 
a.m. counts on August 10, and that they had falsified the respective count slips. 
Noel told the OIG that she signed the August 10 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had 
prefilled.  Noel said she did not know why the 12 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in 
the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates.  Noel recalled that 
Thomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips. 
Noel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York’s 10 South 
Unit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU.  Noel said that when she left the SHU to 
assist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was 
gone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU.  Noel also told the 
OIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately 
a.m., Noel let her into the SHU.  The OIG’s review and analysis of the SHU video shows that the Morning 
Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived in the SHU at approximately 4 a.m., visited the 10 South Unit at 
4:04 a.m., returned to SHU at 4:11 a.m., and left the SHU at 4:14 a.m.  According to Noel, no one other than 
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3, as detailed later below, entered the SHU during 
her shift. 
Thomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2007, he had worked in the SHU fairly 
regularly and he was familiar with how to work in the SHU and how the SHU operated.  Thomas described 
his responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are 
fed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their showers.  Thomas’s Overtime Schedule showed 
that he worked 21 shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2019.  The overtime 
schedule also showed that Thomas worked 12 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the 
SHU in July and August 2019. 

Thomas acknowledged that neither he nor Noel conducted any rounds or counts in the SHU during their 
shift between approximately 12 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m.  Thomas said the August 10, 2019 round 
sheets were signed, but the rounds were not conducted because he was tired that day.  Thomas recalled 
“dozing off from here and there” during his shift, but he did not know if Noel slept. 
Thomas did not recall having a conversation with anyone concerning the discrepancy between the 12 a.m. 
SHU count slip, which listed 73 inmates, and the institutional count, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU.  
Thomas said he had filled out and signed the 3 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU.  
Thomas did not know why the number of inmates was different on the 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. count slips and 
did not recall speaking with the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant about the 12 a.m. count.  Thomas 
told the OIG that he knew he was falsely certifying the count slips when he signed them on August 10, 2019. 
B. 
Staff Rounds in the SHU 
1. CO Rounds 
As detailed in the BOP Policies section of Chapter 2, in addition to inmate counts, BOP policy and MCC 
New York SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the SHU conduct rounds to observe all inmates at 
least twice an hour.  As part of their assigned duties, MCC New York SHU officers had to walk each of the 
tiers of the SHU twice an hour on an irregular schedule, once during the first 30 minutes and again during 
the second 30 minutes, with both rounds occurring no more than 40 minutes apart.  COs working in the 
SHU were required to complete and initial an official MCC New York form, often referred to as a “round 
sheet,” which was reviewed and signed by a supervisor, documenting the date and time of each 30-minute 
round in each tier of the SHU.40 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff spoke about conducting rounds on Epstein 
every day.  He said that the Warden, Lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told 
the SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein.  To reinforce this message, the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officer’s area 
that said, “MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 76318-054 
AS PER GOD!!!!”  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said the sign was hanging on the computer on 
August 9 and 10, 2019, and it was clearly visible to everyone who worked in the SHU.  The Acting Evening 
Watch Activities Lieutenant confirmed that written instructions to conduct rounds on Epstein were posted 
on the SHU computer. 
This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet.” 

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that 
Noel filled out the round sheet on behalf of everyone who was 
working in the SHU during his shift.  The Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge was not certain if all of the rounds were 
actually conducted.  The Material Handler said he believed the 
rounds listed on the round sheet as having occurred between 
4:01 p.m. to 7:36 p.m. probably had been done, but he was 
uncertain about the remaining rounds.  The Material Handler 
said he had seen officers “blow off” 30-minute rounds in the 
past.  Noel told the OIG that, as a general practice, when the 
COs went to the various SHU tiers to distribute food or 
supplies, they counted that as a round.  Noel said she was 
aware that she was supposed to conduct two rounds every 
hour during their shift, but that she had never actually 
completed rounds every 30 minutes while working in the SHU.  
When asked which rounds she conducted on August 9, 2019, 
Noel responded, “That’s hard for me to tell because I didn’t 
conduct it every 30 minutes.  It was give out food, pick up the 
trays, give out toilet paper, go down.  So those were the rounds 
I conducted.”  Noel verified that her initials were on the round 
sheets for August 9 and 10, 2019, and said, consistent with her 
usual practice, she filled out the round sheets and initialed the 
round sheets at the start of the 4 p.m. and the 12 a.m. shifts. 
Noel and Thomas both admitted to the OIG that they did not conduct any of the rounds reflected on the 
SHU Round Sheet on August 10, 2019, from 12 a.m. until Epstein was found hanged in his cell at 
approximately 6:30 a.m.  Nonetheless, Noel completed and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute entries 
stating that she and Thomas had, in fact, conducted such rounds.41  Through review and analysis of the SHU 
video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and Thomas did not 
enter the tiers in the SHU to conduct any of the rounds and counts between 12 a.m. and approximately 
6:30 a.m. on August 10.  Noel and Thomas can be seen at the SHU Officers’ Station, moving in the SHU 
common area, and in the SHU laundry and entrance/exit area throughout the morning of August 10.  
Additionally, from approximately 1 a.m. to 3 a.m., Noel and Thomas were seated at the SHU Officers’ Station 
without moving and appeared to be sleeping.  OIG analysis of the activity on the SHU computers revealed 
that Noel used the computer periodically throughout the night, including to search the Internet for furniture 
sales and benefit websites and to read a news article about Epstein.  Thomas used the computer briefly 
around 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
Noel told the OIG that she went through each tier in the SHU at approximately 10 p.m., and at the time she 
went to Epstein’s cell and saw him laying on a mattress on the floor, which she said was typical for him.  
Epstein asked Noel for his medical device, so she plugged it in for him.  Noel saw that Epstein was in the cell 
by himself and without a cellmate, but she maintained that she did not know that Epstein was required to 
have a cellmate.  Noel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately 15 feet away from the SHU Officers’ 
Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-minute rounds 
were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.

Station.  Noel said that during her shift on August 10, 2019, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other 
than the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU. 
Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG 
determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up 
to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein 
was housed. 
2. Lieutenant Rounds 
BOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being 
followed.  BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at 
least once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log 
book, and talking with staff.”  Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations 
Lieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift.  The training instructs that while in the SHU the 
Operations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and 
periodically observe SHU inmate counts.  The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is 
responsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork, 
coordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches.  The SHU Lieutenant should make 
rounds on the ranges (tiers) each day. 
The statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials.  The Northeast Regional 
Director, the Warden, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the 
OIG that Lieutenants should have walked down all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in 
the SHU.  Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, however, other Lieutenants did not 
always walk down the tiers.  Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to 
store the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU.  This practice was designed to ensure that 
the assigned COs and Lieutenants walked down each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and 
inmate during the round before initialing the round sheet.  On August 9 and 10, 2019, however, the MCC 
New York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather 
than at the end of each tier. 
None of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and 10 alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that 
Epstein lacked a cellmate.  According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant 
conducted a round in the SHU at 11:27 a.m. on August 9.  The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did 
not specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round.  As 
discussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not know that 
Epstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his 
shift on August 9.  The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a 
Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.  The Acting Evening Watch 
Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not know that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New 
York or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not 
attended SHU or department head meetings.  The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the 
August 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a 
round in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the 
round.  The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not know why his signature was on the form 

because he did not conduct any rounds within the SHU on August 9 and he did not recall signing the form.  
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant confirmed that she conducted her round in the SHU at 
approximately 4 a.m. on August 10.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she went up to the 
South Unit and then back down to the SHU because she needed to sign the round sheets.  Contrary to 
BOP training for new Lieutenants, which she attended in 2011, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant 
told the OIG, “We are not required to go to each individual cell and look at the inmates.  When we make 
rounds, we get with the officers.”  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she did not conduct a 
round to observe the inmates when she visited the SHU.  Noel confirmed that the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant visited the SHU but did not walk down the tiers. 
Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the 
OIG determined that at approximately 4 a.m. on August 10, 2019, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant 
briefly visited the SHU as part of her supervisory duties and conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were 
seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU.  Noel told the OIG that at 
approximately 5:30 a.m., Thomas went to the 10 South Unit, which was adjacent to the SHU, to relieve CO 3, 
and that CO 3 briefly walked through the SHU common area as he left and returned from his break.  The 
OIG’s review and analysis of the video footage revealed that, aside from those two officers, no one entered 
the SHU and no one conducted any counts or rounds. 
VI. 
Epstein’s Death on August 10 
A. 
Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response 
On August 10, 2019, shortly after 6 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of breakfast 
carts had arrived at the SHU.  Noel and Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-locked 
entrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU.  At the time, Thomas and Noel were the only officers 
in the SHU.  At approximately 6:30 a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings show Noel and 
Thomas walking toward the L Tier.  Noel and Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering the 
L Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates.  As discussed previously, between 
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, the OIG did not observe 
on the available recorded video any COs or other individuals approach the L Tier where Epstein was housed 
from the common area of the SHU. 
Noel told the OIG that she unlocked the door to the L Tier so Thomas could deliver the breakfast trays.  
Thomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein’s cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the window 
but could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, “Come to the door, come to the door.”  Thomas 
said he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell, 
and saw Epstein hanged as described further below.  Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get 
help, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps 
described below. 

Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein’s cell, 
Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a 
shirt, around his neck.  The end of the string was tied to the 
top portion of the bunkbed.  Epstein was suspended from the 
top bunk in a near-seated position, with his buttocks 
approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his 
legs extended out straight on the floor.  Thomas said Epstein 
did not look discolored or very different from when he last 
saw Epstein alive.  Thomas said he immediately ripped the 
orange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s 
buttocks dropped approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half to 
the ground.  Thomas then lowered Epstein’s entire body to 
the floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was 
breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest 
compressions until responding MCC New York staff members 
arrived approximately 1 minute later.  Thomas said he did not 
provide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead 
or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating 
chest compressions.  Thomas said medical personnel took 
over the emergency response, including chest compressions 
and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when 
they arrived.  Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein 
down to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and 
that he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m.  Thomas 
said he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
training during MCC New York annual refresher training and 
had responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this 
was the first time he was the first responder. 
Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on 
August 10, 2019, from 12 a.m. until the time he attempted to 
deliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:30 a.m. and 
did not see anyone go inside Epstein’s cell during his shift.  Thomas said that he would have known if 
someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did.  Thomas told the OIG that he could see 
Epstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage 
point.  Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knowledge 
because he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry.  The only other key to 
the SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys 
required to gain access to the SHU.  Moreover, Thomas said that anyone attempting to access the L Tier 
where Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where 
Thomas was seated, and no one did.  Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death. 
Noel told the OIG that on the morning on August 10, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she 
unlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates.  Noel said that 
when Thomas knocked on Epstein’s door, there was no response.  Noel said Epstein’s cell door was locked, 
so Thomas used a key to open it and went inside.  Noel heard Thomas call out for her to retrieve the cutter

City of New York 

and then she heard Thomas rip something.  Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his 
arms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him down on the ground to perform CPR.  
According to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cutter she hit the body alarm, which is a 
button on an MCC staff member’s radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency.  Noel recalled 
hearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We’re going to be in so much trouble.”  Noel said she 
stood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in.  Noel said Thomas only 
performed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse.  Noel said 
that when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck.  Noel 
said she did not get the cutter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard. 
Noel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before 
she got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it’s not her fault, we fucked up.”  Noel did not recall 
making any comments or statements to the Lieutenant.  Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall 
which COs responded to the alarm and she did not know what happened in the cell after MCC New York 
staff arrived because she was waiting at the bottom of the steps outside the L Tier.  Noel said she was alone 
in the SHU for 20 minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get 
status updates. 
Noel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately 15 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station.  Noel said she 
would have known if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did.  She also said that 
there was no indication that any of the inmates could have gotten out of their cells.  Noel said she never 
slept during her shift on August 9-10, 2019.  Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not 
moving, she was on the computer.  Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading 
up to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; however, she caught herself and never slept. 
The Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant on August 10, 2019, at approximately 5:30 a.m.  The Lieutenant said that at 
approximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to 
the alarm.  When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.”  Once inside, the Lieutenant observed 
that Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein.  The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where’s his bunkie at?” 
and that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate.  Noel also told the Lieutenant, 
“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.”  Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds.  We messed up.”  The 
Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse. 
The MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.  
When the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members 
were picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher.  The Electronics Technician said he and Senior 
Officer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being 
transported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.42  The Electronics Technician stated that he 
Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff 
and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies, 
and allows EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because COs can directly escort EMTs to 
the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.  If EMTs had to be escorted to the housing unit, 
they would first need to be thoroughly screened, which would delay medical attention. 

then returned to the SHU and worked there for approximately 1 hour, along with the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant and Noel.  The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and 
until approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times.  The Electronics Technician said 
he delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same 
on another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the 
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant.  The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food 
to the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him.  You weren’t making rounds.  You killed him.”  
The Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU 
Officers’ Station and never checked on the inmates.  The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood 
the inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not 
conducted rounds during their shift.  The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his own 
life and said he had no reason to believe otherwise. 
Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff 
members were already performing CPR on Epstein.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with 
transporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then followed the 
ambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty. 
The OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs 
attempting to resuscitate Epstein.  The photographs show, among other things, Epstein on his back with an 
intravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him 
wearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts.  None of the photographs taken at MCC New York show Epstein in 
a hospital gown, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Lower 
Manhattan Hospital which show Epstein in a hospital gown. 
Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at 
the time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of 
sight to Epstein’s cell.43  One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from 
Epstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side 
of L Tier, where Epstein was housed.  Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on 
August 9, 2019, a little before 12 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.  
Inmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning 
of August 10 prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August 10.  Inmate 5 said the male 
CO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door.  Inmate 5 could only see 
Epstein’s legs from the knee down but could tell that Epstein was laying down on his back because his feet 
were pointed upward.  The male CO bent down to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.”  The 
male CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein.  Inmate 5 said 
both the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer.  Inmate 5 said 
that once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein.  The CO then started giving Epstein chest 
compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the 
female CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the button.  The female officer said, 
“Yeah, a long time ago.”  A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to 
As noted previously, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the 
inmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died. 

revive Epstein.  Epstein was not responsive.  Inmate 5 said Epstein looked dead when the male CO tried to 
pick him up and they both fell.  Inmate 5 said officers had trouble getting Epstein onto the stretcher because 
Epstein was basically dead weight.  When the officers did get Epstein on the stretcher, Epstein still had on 
headphones.44  Inmate 5 did not see any marks around Epstein’s neck, and he did not see a rope around 
Epstein’s neck.  However, Inmate 5 saw a male CO come out of Epstein’s cell with a sheet that had a loop 
and knot.

Inmate 6 told the OIG that on August 9 and 10, 2019, he was housed within the SHU on L Tier in a cell 
directly across from Epstein’s cell.  Inmate 6 last saw Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, on August 9 when 
Inmate 3 said, “See you later.  I’m going to court.”  Inmate 6 said Inmate 3 did not return that night and said 
the SHU officers never conducted their required 30-minute rounds.  Inmate 6 believed the COs last checked 
on the inmates in the SHU on August 10 between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m.  Inmate 6 did not observe anyone 
entering Epstein’s cell after Epstein returned from his legal visit on August 9, 2019; did not hear noise that 
night; and said Epstein’s door was not opened during the night.  Inmate 6 said a male officer discovered 
Epstein dead during breakfast delivery on August 10.  Inmate 6 said he observed the male CO entered 
Epstein’s cell and began performing CPR, while the female CO, who appeared panicked, stayed outside of 
the cell.  Inmate 6 said he observed Epstein on the floor but did not see a rope over Epstein’s head.  
However, when Epstein was removed from his cell, Inmate 6 observed the COs holding a rope and a

defibrillator.  Inmate 6 did not see marks on Epstein’s neck but did see bruising on his face and observed 
earphones that were still in place on Epstein’s ears. 
Inmate 7, who was two cells down from Epstein’s cell and on the other side of the tier, told the OIG that he 
could not see into Epstein’s cell but he could see the cell door.  Inmate 7 said that after dinner was brought 
to Epstein’s cell on the evening of August 9, 2019, Inmate 7 did not recall seeing anyone going in or out of 
Epstein’s cell until the following morning at around 6 a.m.  He further stated that he did not hear any door 
“pop open” that evening.  Inmate 7 said he remembered waking up around 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, and 
hearing a voice, possibly male, saying “Breathe.”  Inmate 7 said he saw Epstein removed from his cell on 
a stretcher. 
In addition, the OIG and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed seven inmates assigned to 
other tiers in the SHU, none of whom had any direct knowledge of how Epstein died.  These inmates 
consistently reported that the SHU officers did not systematically conduct the counts and rounds as 
required on the evening Epstein died and that the last round was either between 9:30–10 p.m. or 12:30–
a.m.  Several inmates told the OIG that before Epstein died the SHU staff never conducted rounds at night. 
According to the BOP Form 583 Report of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while 
delivering the breakfast meal, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell.  Consistent with the required 
response to a suspected suicide outlined in the MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders that are 
described in Chapter 2, staff called for assistance and began life-saving measures.45  At 6:39 a.m., Epstein 
was taken to the MCC New York Health Services Unit, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived to MCC 
New York at 6:43 a.m.  Epstein was transported to the local hospital, New York Presbyterian Lower 
Manhattan Hospital, at 7:10 a.m., and was pronounced deceased at 7:36 a.m. 
According to a memorandum attached to the Form 583 from the Clinical Nurse dated August 10, 2019, when 
the medical emergency involving Epstein was called over the radio, the Clinical Nurse immediately 
responded to the call and upon arrival, saw Epstein on the floor within his cell unresponsive with CPR in 
progress by COs.  The Clinical Nurse’s memorandum reads that Epstein was cold, with circumferential 
bruising around his neck and posterior mottling, pupils fixes and dilatated, and no palpable pulses were felt.  
According to the memorandum, at 6:35 a.m., a call was placed for EMS, CPR continued, and an AED was 
utilized and indicated “No Shock Advised,” so CPR continued.  Epstein was then transported to the MCC 
New York Health Services Unit treatment room with CPR in progress.  Upon arrival, Epstein’s pulse was 
checked, and the AED indicated “No Shock Advised.”  EMS and paramedics arrived on the scene, intubated 
Epstein, and gave him medications and fluids.46  Epstein was transported to the local emergency room with 
CPR in progress at approximately 7:10 a.m. 
As noted in Chapter 2, BOP policy provides that the need to immediately attend to an apparent suicide victim, 
undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence over efforts to preserve a 
crime scene. 
The EMS arrival time on the Clinical Nurse’s memorandum is listed as 6:56 a.m.  Based on the OIG’s review of other 
documentation and interviews, we believe the arrival time reflected on those other documents (6:43 a.m.) is more likely 
the time of EMS’s arrival.  We noted that the Clinical Nurse, at the time of EMS’s arrival, was actively engaged in 
administering CPR to Epstein and responding to the health emergency. 

According to a memorandum attached to the Form 583 from the Correctional Systems Officer dated 
August 10, 2019, after Noel called the medical emergency, the Correctional Systems Officer received a call 
from staff in the SHU instructing her to call 911 for an ambulance.  The Correctional Systems Officer notified 
the New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York institutional NYPD telephone.  The 
Correctional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical 
assistance for one of the inmates.  The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at 
6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area.  EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein 
and a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:10 a.m. 
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant 
prior to 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and 
Lieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift.  At some point, the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she 
knew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done.  The Morning 
Watch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate 
meals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out.  Noel was there, but she was not 
helping with delivering food to the inmates.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the 
meals were delivered, she finished up and went home. 
All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not know of any 
information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.  Additionally, no 
inmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his own life 
or had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.  
Some MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other 
things, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had 
been conducted in the SHU as required.  Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages, 
which resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired 
during their shifts.  Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and 
accountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have 
found a way to do so. 
B. 
Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August 10 Following His Death 
Following Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell.  The FBI 
inspected the cell and retrieved what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s 
death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player.  The FBI did not recover 
any weapons inside of the cell.  After the FBI’s inspection, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and 
collected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including 
religious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, batteries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a brown 
paper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.

the search was not of Epstein’s cell.48  BOP records 
did not indicate when Epstein’s cell was last searched. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that 
at least five cell searches should be conducted on the 
day and night watch shifts within the SHU, and that 
cell searches are conducted in cells every time the 
inmate departs the cell.  He said the SHU Officer in Charge was responsible for making sure the searches 
were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE database.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious 
to enter, and he was busy.  He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on 
August 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their 
showers.  He said that during the period of Epstein’s custody, SHU inmates showered on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays.  The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during showers, SHU staff 
searched every cell.  He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9 
because it was a shower day.  He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the 
recreation area or for attorney visits.  According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein’s cell 
should have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9.  He 
further stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched although, as noted above, 
the SHU staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE on August 9 and the search was not of Epstein’s cell. 
As noted previously, Epstein’s cell contained an excessive amount of linens, some of which had been ripped into thin 
strips and tied like a noose.  Figure 6.5 depicts one such noose, which is illustrative of the types of linens found in 
Epstein’s cell; the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself. 
TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related 
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.

Figure 5.5 
The photographs of Epstein’s cell on August 10, 2019, 
show an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing.  
Some of the linens had been ripped into thin strips, 
which were tied to the desk and bunkbed inside the 
cell.  Some of the strips were tied like a noose.  When 
shown a picture of Epstein’s cell, Noel verified that it 
contained a lot of linen and extra clothing.  Noel said 
the mattress on the floor was Epstein’s, as he always 
slept on the mattress on the floor.  As detailed in the 
BOP policies section of Chapter 2, MCC New York 
SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the 
SHU during the daytime tours of duty conduct at 
least five cell searches each day, and that the entire 
SHU, including all common areas and cells, be 
searched every week.  The OIG investigation 
revealed, however, that on August 9, 2019, the SHU 
staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE, and  

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that in 
August 2019, each inmate would have been authorized to 
have two sheets and one blanket.  He said that in the winter, 
inmates are allowed to have an additional blanket.  When 
interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge 
reviewed a picture of Epstein’s cell from August 10, 2019, 
after Epstein had been removed from the cell.  The Day 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge said there appeared to be an 
excess number of linens and blankets in the cell, which he 
believed were for both Epstein and Inmate 3, and that there 
were possibly a couple of extra sheets as well.  He noted that 
there were two mattresses in the cell and deduced that 
Inmate 3’s assigned items had not yet been removed even 
though he had departed MCC New York earlier that day.  
According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
Inmate 3’s items should have been removed as soon as the 
SHU staff knew Inmate 3 was not returning.  He told the OIG 
that any extra linens or blankets should be removed when 
the inmates take showers and their cells are searched.  He 
told the OIG that he believed the purpose of limiting the 
linens provided to the inmates was to ensure there was 
enough to go around and that it was more of an 
administrative matter rather than a security matter. 
The Captain also reviewed the picture of Epstein’s cell from 
August 10, 2019, when interviewed by the OIG.  He said 
Epstein had too many linens, t-shirts, and blankets in his cell.  
The Captain said the SHU staff were responsible for 
removing those items because they did not want to hear the 
other inmates complain that they were not issued the same 
number of items.  The Captain stated that it is also a security 
issue because it “gives the inmates the materials to be able to make homemade fashioned and improvised 
nooses” or “use it as escape paraphernalia,” such as a rope that inmates had used to escape from another 
facility in Chicago. 
Inmate 3 told the OIG that Epstein was allowed to sleep on the floor, which he said was unusual for the SHU 
where that was not normally allowed.  Inmate 3 said Epstein also had two extra blankets, which no other 
inmate had, as well as two pens, which inmates were not allowed to have.  Epstein would ask for things, and 
if the COs said no, Epstein would tell them he was writing down their name and providing the information to 
his lawyer.  According to Inmate 3, the COs were on “eggshells” around Epstein.  Inmate 3 said that when he 
left the SHU on August 9, 2019, there was an orange cloth twisted around the ladder, strings on the side of 
the ladder, and a string tied across the bed.  Inmate 3 explained that the string tied across the bed served as 
a clothesline, and that the strings were part of a sheet they had ripped.  According to Inmate 3, one night he 
woke up, saw Epstein fidgeting with the clothesline, and asked Epstein what he was doing.  Epstein said he 
was trying to fix the clothesline, but Inmate 3 told him no and flushed the clothesline down the toilet.  As 
discussed in Chapter 4, when Inmate 3 and Epstein first became cellmates upon Epstein’s return to the SHU

City of New York 
Figure 5.6 
Photograph of Epstein’s Cell After  
His Death 

following suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while 
Inmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon.  In response, Epstein told 
Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble. 
When Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that 
Epstein could wash his clothes.  Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he 
said there were five blankets in their cell when he left. 
C. 
Autopsy Results 
On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on 
Epstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide.  One of the 
office’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy 
Chief Medical Examiner.  In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner 
who performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner”).  The Medical Examiner told the 
OIG that the pattern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging.  The Medical Examiner 
explained that a different fracture pattern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck 
versus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the pattern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a 
hanging.  The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in 
skin, on his face and mouth.  These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flow is obstructed and the 
small skin capillaries burst.  The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple 
discoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with 
suicide by hanging.  The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from 
his neck up.  In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally 
found only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different pattern.  Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner 
explained, a marked and obvious ligature furrow that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as 
opposed to a ligature strangulation. 
The Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what 
is seen in victims of strangulation.  The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is 
invariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired.  The Medical Examiner noted that the 
autopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle.  Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken 
fingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a 
fight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.  
We also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck, 
which is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck.  Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told 
the OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck.  The Medical Examiner explained that you 
would expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a 
sustained compression like a hanging. 
In addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in 
Epstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during 
the autopsy.  The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrow was too broad to have been 
caused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell.  The Medical Examiner said blood 
toxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s 
system.  The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner’s 

independent medical judgment and that the Medical Examiner was not pressured or otherwise subjected to 
any attempt to influence her ruling. 

Chapter 6:  The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence 
Due to the Security Camera Recording System Failure 
In August 2019, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had 
approximately 150 video security cameras (no audio) placed throughout the institution.  The Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) found that approximately 11 cameras were located in and around the Special 
Housing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August 10, 2019, including one at 
the end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that showed any movement in or out of inmate cells and in 
the Tier’s hallway.  In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live 
video feeds.  Following Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
investigators attempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the 
security cameras were working and transmitting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the 
SHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29, 
2019, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier.  As a result, while the L Tier video camera 
was transmitting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2019, and morning of August 10, 2019, the video 
was not being recorded.  One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and 10 was a 
camera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU.  That camera captured video of a large part of 
the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to 
the different SHU tiers, including the L Tier.  Thus, anyone entering or attempting to enter the L Tier from 
the common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and 10, would have been picked up by the video 
recorded by that camera.  In addition, the recordings showed the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU 
staff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from 
Epstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier. 
I. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York 
All video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) 
system.  The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR 1” and “DVR 2,” and each 
consisted of 16 hard drives used for storing digital recordings.  Roughly half of MCC New York’s security 
cameras were assigned to record to DVR 1, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2.  Cameras 
assigned to DVR 1 only recorded to the DVR 1 hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to 
the DVR 2 hard drives.  Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be 
retrieved from DVR 1, and vice versa. 
The OIG’s investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York.  In August 2019, the 
Electronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York.  The Electronics Technician told the 
OIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2016, he found that the facility’s security camera system 
needed to be upgraded.  According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly 
maintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be 
replaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.  

The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system 
was subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.49 
The Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2018, told the OIG he was generally 
aware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution.  He further 
stated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be 
fixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.  
Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2018, the Warden submitted a 
memorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $800,000 in funding to replace the entire 
camera system.  The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December 1, 2018, and an 
estimated completion date of February 9, 2019.  The BOP approved the funding request, and on 
September 21, 2018, a contract in the amount of $698,108.99 was awarded to Company 1 to provide various 
equipment for the project and associated labor.  On September 24, 2018, a separate contract in the amount 
of $34,089.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to 
install the camera system. 
As the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical, 
electrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs.  MCC New York did not have enough 
qualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the 
facility, so beginning the week of March 17, 2019, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for 
technicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to 
perform the work.  During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the 
camera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC 
New York’s custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills 
required to do the camera work. 
At the time of Epstein’s death on August 10, 2019, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.  
Immediately following Epstein’s death, Company 1 officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new 
recording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing 
cameras.  The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2019, and they were 
installed in stages as the wiring work was conducted.  According to the Electronics Technician, as of 
August 2021, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed. 
II. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2019 
A. 
Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29 
According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC 
New York’s DVR 2 system on July 29, 2019, which resulted in the system being unable to record.  According 
to BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2019, when the 
Special Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden 1 attempted to review recorded 
surveillance video for a matter unrelated to Epstein.  The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no 
The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine 
instances between June 2017 and July 2019, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC 
New York’s cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras. 

recorded video was available for several of the institution’s cameras, so she reported the matter to the 
Communications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his 
shift was scheduled to end.  The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the 
institution’s approximately 150 cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live 
video feed but were not recording. 
The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with 
ensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded.  The Electronics Technician said he therefore did 
not perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded.  The Warden indicated that SIS staff 
are usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to 
the Communications Office.  However, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the 
Electronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording.  The OIG 
found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic 
checks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to 
record.50  The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he now checks to ensure that all 
cameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report 
about the status of the system to the facility’s executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians. 
B. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure 
On August 8, following discovery of the recording failure, Company 1 service request records reflect that the 
Electronics Technician contacted a Company 1 technical support representative, who ultimately determined 
that two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed.  According to the Electronics Technician and the Company 1 
service request record, the Company 1 representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two 
drives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again.  The 
Electronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company 1 Technician that he had to obtain the 
drives from MCC New York’s Computer Services Manager.  The Electronics Technician further stated that he 
left the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on 
the matter.  The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to 
resolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay 
after his shift ended to work on such matters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he 
would not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.51 
The OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave 
that week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure.  The Facility Manager 
confirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death.  The Electronics 
Technician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the 
Acting Facility Manager in the Facility Manager’s absence.  The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the 
Electronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that 
cameras were not recording and said, “I’m going to stay and do overtime tonight.”  Based on his comment, 
For example, BOP Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must 
establish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera 
systems.  This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety. 
According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to 
several days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each. 

the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift 
ended that day to correct the issue.  The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some 
miscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that 
same evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening.  The Electronics Technician told 
the OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that 
same day. 
The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were 
down, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.  
The Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on 
August 10 when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident.  Associate Warden 1 confirmed she 
was with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she 
only knew video could not be replayed.  She did not know the recording system for certain cameras was 
down.  She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording. 
According to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2019, and attended to other 
matters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and 
attempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day.  However, the Electronics Technician told the OIG 
that no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was 
located, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional 
Officer (CO) 4.52  According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO 
4’s shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the 
Electronics Technician performed the work.  According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be 
at the institution the following day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the 
Electronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the following day.  The Electronics Technician 
said his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors 
that such matters did not have to be attended to until the following day, and even if he had replaced the 
hard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore 
not have finished until the following day anyway. 
C. 
SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August 10 
The Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, and shortly 
thereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he 
reported to the SHU to assist.  Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in 
and around the SHU.  The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the 
SHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2.  While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video 
streams on August 9 and 10, 2019, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard 
drive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2019.  Among the cameras whose video 
was not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed. 
The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution’s SIS unit, staff 
assigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians. 

Only two cameras in the vicinity of the SHU area were recording to DVR 1 at the time of Epstein’s death.53  
One camera was located on the upper-level entrance to the 10 South Unit, a housing unit adjacent to the 
SHU, near the door MCC New York staff referred to as the “46 door.”  That camera captured video of a large 
part of the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways 
leading to the different SHU tiers, including the tier containing Epstein’s cell.  Thus, anyone entering or 
attempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU on August 9 and 10 would have been 
picked up by the video recorded by that camera.  Epstein’s cell door, however, was not in that camera’s field 
of view.  The other camera that was recording was located in one of the ninth floor’s two elevator bays and 
provided video of the ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor’s four elevators. 
The available video showed that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted toward the 
L Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge.54  At approximately 
10:39 p.m., an unidentified CO appeared to walk up the L Tier stairway, and then reappeared within view of 
the camera at 10:41 p.m.  This is believed to be the last time anyone entered L Tier before approximately 
6:30 a.m. on August 10.  Between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:30 a.m. on 
August 10, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU 
tiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas’s admissions to the OIG 
that the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame.  At approximately 6:28 a.m., an 
unidentified officer was observed on the L Tier stairway, presumably to deliver breakfast food trays.  
Between 6:28 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., an unidentified officer, believed to be Noel, moved back and forth several 
times between the L Tier stairway and the SHU Officers’ Station.  At approximately 6:33 a.m., additional 
officers entered the SHU and ascended the L Tier stairway, presumably after Noel activated her body alarm 
when Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell. 
As noted above, the camera at the end of the L Tier was providing a live video feed at the time of Epstein’s 
death but the video was not being recorded.  The Electronics Technician told the OIG that certain MCC 
New York personnel, including the Control Center, SIS personnel, the Warden, most Lieutenants, and the 
Electronics Technician, had access to the live video feed of the institution’s security cameras.  He explained 
that to view the live feed of a particular camera an employee with access would need to key in the specific 
camera into the security camera system to call up the live feed.  The Correctional Systems Officer, who was 
working in the Control Center on August 10 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the Morning Watch Operations 
Lieutenant both told the OIG that the only live feed from the SHU on their screens was video from the 
camera showing the SHU common area, and they did not perceive a need to take the necessary steps to see 
the live feed from the SHU L Tier from either of their duty stations on the evening Epstein died. 
One additional camera located at the 10 South Officers’ Station was recording on August 10, 2019.  That camera is not 
depicted in Figure 4.12 because neither the SHU nor the SHU entrances were within the field of view of that camera. 
The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the 10 South Unit to be of low quality.  Due to the 
video’s low quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe 
movement of individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively identify the individuals.  The OIG was 
also not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera 
only captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers.  The OIG found that movements captured on the 
video were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented 
in BOP records.

The Warden, who was not scheduled to work on August 10, 2019, arrived at the institution later that 
morning after being notified of Epstein’s death and was informed that most of the cameras in the SHU were 
not recording.  He told the OIG that when the SIS Lieutenant arrived at the facility that morning, he informed 
her that the SHU cameras had not been recording, and the SIS Lieutenant explained that the hard drive 
issue had been detected on August 8.  He told the OIG that prior to August 10, he was unaware that the 
DVR 2 issue had been detected on August 8, and that approximately half of the facility’s cameras, and in 
particular the cameras in the SHU, were found to not be recording on that date. 
The Electronics Technician told the OIG that the Warden had instructed Electronics Technician to try and 
recover any potential SHU video that may have been recorded by the cameras assigned to the 
malfunctioning DVR 2 system, but the Electronics Technician was unable to find anything.  The Electronics 
Technician further said that the Warden wanted to have all the facility’s cameras recording again as soon as 
possible, so he instructed the Electronics Technician to begin repairing DVR 2. 
D. 
FBI Forensic Analysis of the DVR System 
FBI evidence documents revealed that on August 10, 2019, the FBI seized all hard drives contained within 
the DVR 2 system.  On August 14, 2019, the FBI returned to MCC New York and seized additional DVR 2 
components.  On August 15, 2019, the FBI seized the entire DVR 1 system. 

The FBI’s Digital Forensics Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, received MCC New York’s DVR system on 
August 16, 2019, and began to conduct a forensic analysis of the system.  According to FBI forensic reports, 
DVR 2 did not start successfully.  The Digital Forensics Analysis Unit found that the system contained three 
faulty hard drives.  The FBI forensic reports state that the three drives were repaired by an FBI Advanced 
Data Recovery Specialist, but the DVR was never able to be assembled successfully.  The forensic reports 
further state that an FBI computer scientist and the Company 1 Technician reviewed the DVR 2 controller 
logs and found that there had previously been “catastrophic disk failures” and no recordings would have 
been available after July 29, 2019. 
When the OIG asked the Electronics Technician about this finding by the FBI, he told the OIG he was 
unaware that cameras were not recording to DVR 2 between July 29 and August 8, 2019.  Neither the 
Warden nor the SIS Lieutenant was aware the cameras assigned to DVR 2 had not been recording since 
July 29, 2019.  The Company 1 Technician could not recall working with the Electronics Technician on any 
DVR issues prior to August 8, 2019, but he said that if the entire DVR 2 server went down on July 29, 2019, no 
video would have been able to have been retrieved from that point forward from any of the cameras 
recording to DVR 2. 

Chapter 7:  Conclusions and Recommendations 
I. 
Conclusions 
Our investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of 
Jeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate 
counts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which 
compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution.  Specifically, 
we found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that, 
among other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate 
counts and 30-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special 
Housing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York’s security camera system. 
We further found that multiple BOP employees submitted false documents claiming that they had 
performed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor 
when questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions.  Two MCC New York 
employees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to 
their conducting inmate counts and rounds.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York 
subsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court 
dismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their 
agreements.  Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for 
other MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9–10, 2019, who the OIG found also 
created, certified, and submitted false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day 
before and the day of Epstein’s death. 
The OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department’s directive 
that Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor allowed Epstein to make an 
unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death. 
The OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and 
unmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on 
August 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day.  
Additionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability 
of MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates.  As detailed below, we make a number of 
recommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation 
and review. 
While the OIG determined that MCC New York staff committed significant violations of BOP and MCC 
New York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did 
not uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding 
the absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein died.  All MCC New York staff members who were 
interviewed by the OIG said they did not know of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death 
was something other than suicide.  Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible 
information that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. 

As detailed in Chapter 4 of this report, the SHU was a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates 
were securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for 
approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.  
Access to the SHU was controlled by multiple locked doors.  The primary entrance to the SHU (Main Exterior 
Entry Door) was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York’s centralized Control Center.  
Additionally, there was a second locked door at the main entrance (Main Interior Entry Door), which could 
be opened only with a key held by a limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) while on duty.55  Within the 
SHU, the entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or bottom of the 
staircase leading to the individual tier.  Keys to open the locked tier doors were available only to a limited 
number of COs while on duty.  Each tier had eight cells, each of which could house either one or two 
inmates.  Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.  The SHU cell doors were 
made of solid metal with a small glass window and small locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff 
inmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates.  As a further security measure, during each shift a 
limited number of the COs had keys while on duty. 
BOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells overnight.  The OIG found no 
evidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was 
housed was unlocked on the evening of August 9–10, 2019, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at 
approximately 8 p.m.  SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were 
locked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could 
have gotten out of their cells.  Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC 
New York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9–10.  The door to 
Epstein’s cell was visible from the SHU Officers’ Station, and CO Tova Noel and Material Handler 
Michael Thomas told the OIG that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell during their shift on August 10.  
Both of them further described delivering breakfast to the L Tier at about 6:30 a.m. on August 10, and how 
Noel unlocked the door to the L Tier, Thomas entered the L Tier and called for Epstein, and then Thomas 
unlocked his cell door when Epstein failed to respond.  Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in 
the same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and 10, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s 
cell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein 
to his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC 
New York SHU. 
Further, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of 
the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system’s video 
recording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6.  The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any 
COs (other than those assigned to the SHU during that timeframe or had a specific reason for visiting the 
SHU) or other individuals present in the common area of the SHU approach any of the SHU tiers, including 
the L Tier where Epstein was housed, between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and approximately 
6:30 a.m. on August 10.  In sum, the OIG’s investigation did not find any evidence that anyone was present in 
The primary entrance doors to the MCC New York SHU are shown in Figure 4.1.  Access to the secondary entrance to 
the SHU, which was adjacent to the elevator bay on the south side of the floor, was also controlled by an exterior entry 
door opened by the Control Center and an interior door opened only with a key held by one of the COs assigned to the 
SHU while on duty.  The secondary entrance doors to the SHU are shown in Figure 4.2. 

the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier 
of the SHU. 
We also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shown in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in 
plain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements, 
including into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if, 
unbeknownst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that 
time.  As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and 
inmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where 
they know cameras are not located.56  Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the 
SHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station 
immediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the 
L Tier.  We additionally found that Thomas’s and Noel’s reaction on the morning of August 10 upon finding 
Epstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates, 
was consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s 
cell at about 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
We further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation 
due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his 
cell on the morning of August 10; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days 
before he died.  No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death.  Additionally, the inmates 
who were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not 
systematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the 
SHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU.  As a result, Epstein was 
unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an 
opportunity for him to commit suicide. 
Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were 
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation.  The 
Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrow was too broad to have been caused by the 
electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications 
or illegal substances were in Epstein’s system.  The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris 
under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that 
would have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a 
homicide by strangulation. 
This is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on 
the part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that 
inmates are safe, secure, and in good health.  For instance, the OIG’s December 2022 investigation and 
review of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and 
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera 
System, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-001 (October 2021); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ 
Management and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 21-091 (July 2021); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report 16-05 (June 2016). 

management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.57  Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and 
serious transgressions that occurred in this matter came to light largely because they involved a high-profile 
inmate.  The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and 
Bulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the 
custody and care of such inmates. 
Regrettably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions.  For example, the OIG has 
investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning 
inmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution.  The OIG currently has 
two open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving 
an inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility. 
This investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.  
Witnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate 
accountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one 
staff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties.  As 
discussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to 
address staffing shortages.  Most recently, in March 2023, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing 
shortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2015.58 
Further, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been attentive to the needs 
of inmates at risk for suicide.  In this investigation, that inattention manifested in the failure of MCC 
New York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC 
New York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2019 incident in which Epstein was 
discovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck.  In a March 2023 report, the OIG found that BOP 
psychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who 
died by suicide while in COVID-19 quarantine units between March 2020 and April 2021.59  The OIG’s 2017 
report on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling 
may present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding 
the use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2023.60 
Lastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follow, the persistent 
deficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.

and Inspections Report 17-05 (July 2017). 

The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this 
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s 
custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life, resulting in significant questions being asked 
about the circumstances of his death, how it could have been allowed to have happen, and most 
importantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged 
crimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process.  The fact that these failures have 
been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for 
Department of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and 
related problems plaguing the BOP. 
The OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action. 
Unless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining 
whether DOJ personnel have committed misconduct.  The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this 
same standard when reviewing a federal agency’s decision to take adverse action against an employee 
based on such misconduct.  See 5 U.S.C. § 7701(c)(1)(B) and 5 C.F.R. § 1201.56(b)(1)(ii). 
A. 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as 
Instructed by the Psychology Department on July 30 
On July 30, 2019, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 70 BOP staff members  
stating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”  The Psychology Department’s 
directive that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2019, 
when Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck.  Epstein’s 
cellmate at the time (Inmate 1) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another 
inmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate 1’s 
account.  Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied.  Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he 
thought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not know what had 
occurred.  Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the 
same cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him. 
As a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.  
Consistent with the Psychology Department’s directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the 
OIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement.  These and other witnesses 
said staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate.  However, 
despite the Psychology Department’s widely disseminated July 30 email instruction and the subsequent 
verbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on 
August 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide. 
1. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a 
New Cellmate 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU 
failed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York 
and therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate.  The failure to make these required 
notifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further below—

resulted in Epstein being housed without a cellmate at the time of his death, which was contrary to the 
Psychology Department’s directive issued just 10 days earlier. 
BOP standards of conduct require that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”61  MCC 
New York Post Orders for the SHU require, among other things, that all SHU officers “maintain a log of 
pertinent information regarding inmate activity, detailing time, persons involved (if pertinent) and the event, 
which must be logged into TRUSCOPE.”62  Importantly, the SHU Post Orders clarify that they “are not 
intended to describe in detail all the officer’s responsibilities.  Good judgment and common sense are 
expected in all situations not covered in these post orders.” 
On August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and CO 
Tova Noel were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly assigned post and 
served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.63  The OIG investigation found that each 
of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology 
Department’s directive. 
The OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s 
cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all 
MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the 
institution.  Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge and CO 1, who was also assigned to the SHU, reviewed the MCC New York daily call out list, 
a document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, which listed Inmate 3 
as being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings.  At approximately 8:30 a.m., CO 1 
escorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the 
Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for his 
daily meeting with his attorneys.64  During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO 1 
discussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer.65  The Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared following Epstein’s death, 
that he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new 
cellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant.  However, the OIG did not credit the Day 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in 
fact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief. 
BOP Program Statement 3420.11. 
TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related 
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log. 
Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at 10 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019. 
Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave 
the facility. 
The OIG did not find that CO 1 failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-
of-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. 

100 
The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate.  The Evening 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s 
telephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed 
the need for Epstein to have a new cellmate.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG 
that he notified an unspecified supervisor.  However, other witnesses did not corroborate his account.  Noel 
told the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been 
removed from the institution.  Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately 
p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s 
medical device for him.  The OIG did not credit Noel’s statements that she did not know that Epstein needed 
a cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements 
(including her own) regarding SHU staff’s knowledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s 
transfer out of the SHU.66 
The OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was 
permanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of 
conduct.  Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these 
individuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required.  Finally, all of these officers 
failed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not 
immediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who 
had been released from suicide watch and psychological observation 10 days earlier had an 
appropriate cellmate. 
2. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff 
The OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties, 
which contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death.  Rather 
than passively relying on a notification from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation 
under federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included 
supervision of SHU personnel.67  The OIG’s investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch 
Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and 
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the 
U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2019, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be 
transferred to another facility the following day.  If any of these supervisors had read the email attachment, 
they would have known of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.  Instead, many of these individuals 
told the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he 
would not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate.  The SHU Lieutenant’s shift on August 8 ended over 
an hour before the USMS sent the email notification and he was not working on August 9.  In his absence, 
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations 
Lieutenant, and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective 
Noel reviewed a draft of the report and we considered her comments but made no changes as a result. 
5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(b)(5); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.705(a). 

101 
shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.68  The OIG found that the failure of these 
individuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been 
on suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance 
failure. 
3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate 
Additionally, the OIG found that the Warden’s failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein 
constituted poor judgment.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew 
that Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with 
Epstein.  The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive 
leadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate following the events of July 23, 2019.  The Warden told 
the OIG that no inmates were pre-vetted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. 69  The 
Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been 
removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to 
ensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate.  This selection process, which involved multiple 
steps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time 
and ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2019. 
4. Lack of Candor 
BOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by 
providing all pertinent information they may have.  Full cooperation requires truthfully responding 
to questions.”70 
As discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told 
the OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.  
Based on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in 
their OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy.  Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation 
of BOP policy when she said she did not know that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate 
Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU. 
The OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the 
OIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with 
a cellmate.  Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members 
who responded to the July 23, 2019 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide 
watch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department’s July 30, 2019 
The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement.  The OIG credited her account 
because she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department’s July 30, 
2019 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2019 email notifying 
that Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the following day. 
Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates 
for Epstein.

email identifying the cellmate requirement; and the statements of multiple witnesses who told the OIG that 
Epstein’s cellmate requirement was widely disseminated verbally by MCC New York leadership. 
B. 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct Mandatory Rounds and Inmate Counts 
Resulting in Epstein Being Unobserved for Hours Before His Death 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9 and 10, 2019, MCC New York SHU staff did not 
conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their shift in the SHU.  The failure to undertake 
these required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to 
properly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further below—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for 
hours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an 
appropriate cellmate. 
1. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU 
Federal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.”71  
Additionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that 
fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”72  Because 
“[i]nattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,” 
BOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours.”  
BOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and 
inmate counts.73  Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and 
ensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health. 
BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability 
measures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice 
each hour, no more than 40 minutes apart.  BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify 
that at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 
p.m., and 10 p.m. daily, and also at 10 a.m. on weekends and federal holidays. 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the 
SHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:15 p.m. on August 9, 2019; however, this inmate transfer 
was not documented until approximately 12:35 a.m. on August 10, 2019.  Based on this internal transfer, 
BOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. SHU inmate counts 
on August 9 were erroneous.  In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which 
did not show COs walking up or down the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a 
process that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.74  During their OIG interviews, the 
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael 
Thomas each admitted that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU 
5 C.F.R. § 2635.705(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(b)(5). 
BOP Program Statement 3420.11. 
BOP Program Statement 5500.14. 
As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of low quality.  Therefore, the OIG 
analyzed the video in conjunction with BOP records and witness statements regarding the personnel in the SHU and 
their activities. 

103 
on the evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10.  Noel told the OIG that she conducted the 10 p.m. 
count on August 9.  The OIG did not credit her statement based on:  (1) its review of the SHU security 
camera video, which reflects Noel walking up and down the stairs leading to some, but not all, of the tiers 
several minutes after the SHU inmate count had been called into the Control Center; (2) the 10 p.m. count 
slip, which erroneously included the SHU Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and 
Delivery; (3) other BOP records; and (4) the Material Handler’s statement to the OIG that no one conducted 
the 10 p.m. count because everyone was tired. 
Instead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found 
that officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, including the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas 
primarily remained seated in the SHU Officers’ Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time, 
suggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of Internet searches on MCC New York 
computers.  Thomas also admitted to the OIG that he “dozed off” for periods of time during his shift.  The 
OIG’s analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately 10:40 p.m., no CO 
entered Epstein’s tier in the SHU until just before 6:30 a.m. when Noel and Thomas began to serve breakfast 
to the inmates. 
The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material 
Handler, Noel, and Thomas failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their 
respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that their actions constituted 
violations of 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
2. False Statements and Lack of Candor 
The OIG’s investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by 
attesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not. 
Federal law provides that “whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive…branch of the 
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully…makes or uses any false writing or document 
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated 
U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
As discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, 
Noel, and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts.  As part of each 
institutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two COs to conduct each 
count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York form, often called a 
count slip.75  On the count slip, both COs are required to fill in the date and time the count had been 
performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then sign the 
count slip.  Once the COs complete and sign the count slips, the count slips are then collected and delivered 
to the MCC New York Control Center.  Officers assigned to the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each 
This BOP form is officially entitled “Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip.” 

104 
inmate was accounted for.76  Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and 
the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the 
institutional count be deemed “cleared” or completed. 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or 
signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability 
responsibilities when, in fact, they had not.77  These individuals admitted to the OIG that instead of 
performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed 
were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the 
documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts.  Additionally, Noel admitted 
to the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 30-minute 
rounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely attested to having completed the rounds.78 
Noel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and 
rounds.  Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for the Southern District of New York.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York 
declined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler. 
The OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, 
and Thomas knowingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by attesting that they 
had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2019, and morning of 
August 10, 2019. 
Additionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation 
and truthfully respond to questions.  The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she 
had conducted the 10 p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have 
conducted a round at the time. 
3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York supervisory staff 
requested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member 
working three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight. 
The collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides 
that “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 ½) hours, and the 
The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.” 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed 
the 10 p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips. 
This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet.” 

105 
minimum elapsed time of on ‘days off’ will be fifty-six (56) hours, except when the employee requests 
the change.”79 
The Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12 a.m. 
to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift in the warehouse.  At some point during the day 
shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler 
if he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed.  The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt 
pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from 12 a.m. on August 9 
through 12 a.m. on August 10.  As discussed previously, the Material Handler admitted to the OIG that on 
the evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the 
mandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired. 
The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor 
judgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift.  As the Day Watch 
Operations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have known 
that the Material Handler had already worked 16 straight hours.  Additionally, the Day Watch Operations 
Lieutenant’s action was inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and did not reflect sound 
correctional judgment, as it would have been extremely difficult for the Material Handler to have effectively 
performed his duties during his third shift. 
4. Clearing the 10 p.m. Institutional Count Knowing that It Was Inaccurate 
The OIG’s investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff cleared the 
p.m. institutional count knowing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate. 
BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that COs conducting an institutional count relay the 
count verbally to the Control Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates.80  If a count reported 
verbally does not match the master count, the Control Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and 
the staff members must recount the inmates.  MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount 
slips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.” 
As discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU 
to Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer.  The 
failure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts, 
resulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number 
of inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the 10 p.m. institutional count. 
During his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admitted that 
he amended the 10 p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an attempt to 
reflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU following the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a 
SHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 
acknowledged that he should have requested a recount from the SHU, but instead he cleared the 10 p.m. 
BOP and Council of Prison Locals, Master Agreement, July 21, 2014–July 20, 2021 (extended until 2026). 
BOP Program Statement 5270.11. 

106 
count.  Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was known as “ghost counting,” 
something he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations Lieutenant or 
someone of a higher rank than himself.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having 
authorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that 
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count. 
The OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving 
and Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the 10 p.m. institutional count 
knowing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds 
The OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties, 
which contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death.  As discussed 
above, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the 
performance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.81  Additionally, BOP 
policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are 
being followed.82 
The OIG’s investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.83  The Evening Watch 
Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct 
any rounds in the SHU.  He acknowledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did 
not sign all of the pages as he should have.  Beginning at 10 p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU.  The Morning Watch Operations 
Lieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the 12 a.m. count on August 10, which was due to SHU 
staff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the 
inmates in the SHU.  According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have 
conducted another count and submitted a new count slip, but she did not know if they actually did so. 
During her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at 
approximately 4 a.m. on August 10.  The OIG’s review of the available SHU security camera video revealed 
that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during 
which time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station 
in the common area of the SHU.  The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not 
required to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of 
the Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty.  This description of a Lieutenant round 
5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(b)(5); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.705(a). 
BOP Program Statement 5270.11. 
The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant also had oversight over the SHU during her overtime shift (4 p.m. to  
p.m. on August 9, 2019) in an acting capacity.  The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening 
Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any 
institutional counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift.  The Acting Evening Watch Activities 
Lieutenant also told the OIG that she conducted one round in the SHU sometime between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., during which 
time she walked down all of the tiers. 

107 
is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which 
emphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk down all of the SHU tiers during a round.  During their 
interviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden 1, and the Captain 
clarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk 
down each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns.  They explained that 
the Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk down each of the tiers to check on the inmates in 
the SHU.  As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population, 
SHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell.  Further, the BOP 
Lieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant attended in 2011, taught that 
Operations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit 
will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.”  Instead, 
Operations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs 
and reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU. 
The OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch 
Operations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant 
to adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff’s failure to 
conduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure. 
C. 
MCC New York Staff Allowed Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on 
August 9 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an 
unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to 
7:19 p.m.  Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call, 
including the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation. 
Federal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate 
telephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution 
and to protect the public.”84  For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone 
calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.85  BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in 
times of crisis,” inmates may be permitted to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone 
System.  In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and 
“must be set to record telephone calls.”  Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the 
BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date 
and time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call.  The Special 
Investigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days. 
The OIG’s investigation determined that on August 9, 2019, Epstein asked to call his mother.  The Unit 
Manager told the OIG that after Epstein’s attorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allow Epstein to place a 
telephone call on an unrecorded legal line.  The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that 
Epstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.  The OIG’s 
28 U.S.C. § 540.102. 
BOP Program Statement P5264.08. 

108 
investigation established both that Epstein’s mother was deceased at the time he asked to telephone her 
and that Epstein had been assigned the necessary documentation that would have allowed him to place 
calls through the Inmate Telephone System, although he did not take the necessary steps to complete the 
setup process that would have given him the ability to place calls through that system.  The Captain told the 
OIG that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his attorney visit back to the SHU and Epstein’s 
requested call was discussed, he told the Unit Manager that Epstein’s telephone call had to be monitored 
and logged. 
The Unit Manager told the OIG that he escorted Epstein from his attorney visit to the shower area of the 
SHU, where he connected a telephone into an unrecorded legal line and dialed the phone number provided 
by Epstein.  The Unit Manager said that when a male answered the call, he handed the telephone to Epstein, 
and then left MCC New York for the day because his shift had ended.  Before leaving the SHU, the Unit 
Manager said he told the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, and Noel, who were at 
the SHU Officers’ Station, to make sure Epstein got his 15 minutes on the telephone, but he did not instruct 
them to monitor the telephone call.  The Unit Manager admitted that he did not verify the recipient of the 
telephone call, and that neither he nor anyone monitored or logged the telephone call as required. 
The OIG found that the Unit Manager violated BOP policy by allowing Epstein to make an unrecorded and 
unmonitored telephone call, and by failing to verify the telephone call recipient, monitor, and log the call.  
We further found that the Unit Manager exercised poor judgment when he left MCC New York while Epstein 
was still on the telephone call that the Unit Manager had arranged and failed to instruct the Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, or Noel to monitor the call. 
D. 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct and Document Cell Searches and Eliminate 
Safety Hazards in Epstein’s Cell on August 9 Leaving Epstein with Excessive Linens 
in His Cell 
The OIG’s investigation and review determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9, 
2019, failed to conduct and document searches of Epstein’s cell in the SHU.  BOP policy requires that BOP 
staff routinely and irregularly search housing units.86  MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU staff 
conduct at least five cell searches each shift during daytime and evening hours (7:45 a.m. to 12 a.m.), in 
addition to other searches of SHU cells and common areas, and BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post 
Orders require written documentation of cell searches.  BOP policy explains that the purpose of cell 
searches is to, among other things, maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate safety hazards.  To that end, 
MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders provide that when an inmate is transferred out of a 
facility, all of the inmate’s linens should be taken to Receiving and Discharge. 
The OIG reviewed MCC New York SHU TRUSCOPE entries for August 9, and identified only one cell search 
entered by MCC New York SHU staff for the entire day.  During his interview with the OIG, the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge stated that multiple cell searches were conducted in the MCC New York SHU on 
August 9; however, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches 
within the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties.  The Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge further stated that any of the SHU staff could have logged the cell searches into 
BOP Program Statement 5521.06. 

109 
TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so.  The Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches 
during his shift in the SHU on August 9.  Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive 
amount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell.  The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the 
OIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an 
improvised noose or use as escape paraphernalia. 
The OIG found that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the 
required cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the 
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU 
conducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York 
SHU Post Orders.  Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in 
Charge during their respective shifts on August 9 and 10, 2019, to have permitted Epstein to have an 
excessive amount of linens in his cell. 
E. 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera 
System was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence 
This investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York’s security camera 
system.  These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was 
being housed to not record video starting in late July 2019 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s 
death on August 10, 2019.  According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on 
July 29, 2019, a disk failure in MCC New York’s DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution’s 
cameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with 
no video recording.  MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until 11 days later on 
August 8, 2019.  MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore 
recording functionality.  Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after 
Epstein’s death. 
The Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.  
The Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in 
September 2018, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $730,000 to purchase new equipment for the 
camera replacement project.  Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components 
approximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner.  The 
new cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation.  Management 
faced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not 
allow for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system.  The OIG determined that as 
of August 2021—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the 
system upgrade still had not been completed.87 
The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2021 due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this 
investigation and review. 

110 
MCC New York’s failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely 
repairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system 
of security cameras.  Dating back to at least 2013, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the 
BOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras, 
poor video quality, and inadequate video storage.  In a 2016 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction 
efforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP 
evaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.88  In response to the 2016 recommendation, the BOP 
assessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its 
122 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades.  The BOP worked to upgrade 
the systems at those 45 institutions between 2019 and 2021.  In June 2021, the BOP reported that it had 
updated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed 
additional cameras to bolster surveillance.  However, as reported in an October 2021 Management Advisory 
Memorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found 
that the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2016 OIG report.  In its 
2021 Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive 
strategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system.  The BOP has provided the OIG with 
a strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system 
concerns and completing the system upgrades.89  As of 2023, the OIG’s 2021 recommendation 
remains open. 
The BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at 
individual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential 
to impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct.  It is imperative that the 
BOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate 
security risks. 
II. 
Recommendations 
The OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to 
ensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of 
inmates.  The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for 
suicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and 
institutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP. 
1. 
The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch 
or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
individual or security considerations. 
According to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy 
Statement 5324.08, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.  The supplemental 
U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report 
16-05 (June 2016). 
U.S. DOJ OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera System, Management 
Advisory Memorandum 22-001 (October 2021). 

111 
policy does not, however, describe how long the cellmate requirement should last or if any staff must 
approve the removal of the cellmate requirement.  The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 
5324.08 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming 
off of suicide watch.  The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of 
suicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.” 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knowledge gaps among MCC New York staff 
regarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff 
would be beneficial.  The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all 
inmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for 
exceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining 
when a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and 
communicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates. 
2. 
The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for 
whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan 
for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
individual or security considerations. 
The OIG’s investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a 
new cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York.  Although the failure to assign a 
new cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff 
failing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a 
contingency plan.  The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein 
needed a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which 
was consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG.  A contingency plan, such as a 
list of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed 
alone at the time of his death.  The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for 
cellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or 
security considerations. 
3. 
The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval 
for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the 
process, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should 
include in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on 
suicide watch or psychological observation. 
According to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.08 and the MCC New York 
Institution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant 
observation by staff or trained inmate observers.  The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states 
that only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of 
Programs will visitation either social or legal be permitted for inmates on suicide watch.  Additionally, the 

112 
MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation states that inmates on psychological 
observation will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member. 
A review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2019, revealed Epstein was allowed to leave the 
suicide watch room to visit with his attorneys for more than 6 hours.  According to the Psychological 
Reconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s 
psychological observation on July 24 through July 30, 2019, Epstein was also allowed to visit with his 
attorneys between 8–11 hours each day without direct observation.  Although the MCC New York 
supplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide 
watch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by 
the Captain or an Associate Warden.  Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 
5324.08 does not describe any process or procedures that allows an inmate to have legal or social visits 
while on suicide watch or psychological observation.  The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate 
its current process for such visits to be approved and documented. 
4. 
The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and 
wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies.  Most fundamentally, 
MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, did not conduct many of the required 
rounds and inmate counts.  Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates, 
including cell assignments and internal inmate transfers.  Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and 
the Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility 
as accountability tools.  Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting 
for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
5. 
BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round. 
The OIG’s investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff 
assigned to the SHU.  Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one 
round in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.  
During their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what 
should be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was 
not memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order.  The OIG recommends that the BOP 
develop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of 
supervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to better ensure that BOP staff are 
appropriately supervised. 

113 
6. 
The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing 
shortages at its prisons. 
Since at least 2015, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including 
medical staffing shortages.90  This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies 
on inmate safety.  For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—
on August 9, 2019, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for 
inmate location and wellbeing in the SHU.  The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the 10 p.m. 
SHU inmate count because they were tired.  Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in 
connection with MCC New York’s upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office 
arranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC 
New York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work.  Yet, during the course of 
the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY 
staff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York’s custody posts.  Without adequate staffing, the BOP 
cannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities.  The OIG therefore recommends 
that the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions. 
7. 
The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be 
appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
The OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at 
the time of his death.  BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched, 
but they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG 
present a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the 
institution.  Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make 
changes as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.

to respond to inmates’ medical needs during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic.  These findings are summarized 
in the OIG’s Capstone report.

8. 
The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera 
systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to 
record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
functionality checks. 
As discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels 
of leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s 
death, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis 
to ensure that the system was functional.  As a result, when on July 29, 2019, video from approximately half 
of the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for 
days.  The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera 
systems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure 
the camera system is fully functional.  Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video 
streams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can 
potentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates.  The OIG therefore recommends that 
the BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security 
camera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct 
periodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action 
as soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable.  Such routine checks would help ensure that 
camera system malfunctions are detected and corrective actions are initiated in a timely manner.

MEMORANDUM FOR 
SARAH E. LAKE 
FROM: 
SUBJECT: 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
Colette S. Peters, Director 
Response to the Office oflnspector General's (OIG) Draft Report: 
Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, 
and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York, New York 
The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opp011unity to formally respond to the Office of the 
Inspector General's (OIG) above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the 
facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the 
recommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this 
engagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape. 
The facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this 
report reflect a failure to follow BOP's longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While 
this misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very 
small percentage of the approximately 35,000 employees across more than 120 institutions who 
continue to strive for correctional excellence every day. 
In the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve 
accountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen 
employee accountability.

OIG Official Draft Report: BOP's Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York, 
New York 
June 22, 2023 
Page 2 of3 
In April of this year, BO P's leadership announced its new mission as "corrections professionals 
who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals 
for successful reentry into our communities." BOP's new core values include accountability, 
integrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence. Of note, our core value of 
accountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public, 
ourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take, 
and the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is committed to 
providing a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
particular individual or security considerations. 
BOP's Response: The BOP recognizes the impo11ance of careful monitoring of adults in 
custody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation. 
Our practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved 
and overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein's death, the BOP 
has updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP's 
revised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists 
make individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up and other custodial 
concerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees 
work collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed 
appropriately. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the pa11icular individual or security 
considerations. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to 
Recommendation 1, BOP's current process related to suicide watch and psychological 
observation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody. 
Upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care 
recommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP 
thoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at 
moderate to high risk for suicide. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
observation.

BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
staffing shortages at its prisons. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Hiring and retaining qualified 
personnel is a key priority and BOP has developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach 
that involves enhanced recruitment efforts and appropriate incentives. While the issues raised in 
the OIG's report were the result of employees failing to adhere to their duties, as opposed to a 
staffing shortage, the BOP welcomes the opportunity to continue the significant work that has 
already been undertaken and that is ongoing regarding staffing. 
Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
functionality checks. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
The BOP appreciates OIG's careful attention to this engagement, and its willingness to provide 
specific, feasible recommendations that address the root causes of issues raised in the incident 
described. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this report. We look forward to 
working with OIG to close these recommendations.

Appendix B:  OIG Analysis of the BOP’s Response 
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided a draft of this report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP), and the BOP’s response is incorporated as Appendix A.  The BOP indicated in its response that it 
agreed with all eight recommendations.   
The following provides the OIG’s analysis of the BOP’s response and a summary of the actions necessary to 
close the recommendations.  The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response 
to the recommendations within 90 days of the issuance of this report.   
Recommendation 1:  The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide 
watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or 
security considerations. 
Status:  Resolved. 
BOP Response:  The BOP reported the following: 
The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in custody who face mental 
health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.  Our practice is to 
carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved and overarching 
safety and security concerns.  In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP has updated its 
process related to suicide watch and psychological observation.  Under BOP’s revised process, 
upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists make 
individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up and other custodial concerns, 
including housing and cellmates.  Mental health, custody, and unit team employees work 
collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed 
appropriately. 
OIG Analysis:  The BOP’s response is responsive to this recommendation.  The OIG will consider whether to 
close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides for the OIG’s review a proposed process for assigning 
a cellmate following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
particular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2) 
implements the process.       
Recommendation 2:  The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide 
and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-
assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
considerations. 
Status:  Resolved. 
BOP Response:  The BOP reported the following: 
The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to Recommendation 
1.  BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological observation applies an 

119 
individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.  Upon removal from 
suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care recommendations are made 
by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual.  BOP thoroughly evaluates each 
celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at moderate to high risk 
for suicide. 
OIG Analysis:  The BOP’s response is not fully responsive to this recommendation.  Recommendation 1 
focuses on the process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch and psychological observation.  
Recommendation 2, on the other hand, focuses on procedures to ensure that inmates at high risk for 
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended continue to have a cellmate until the recommendation is 
changed or rescinded.  Our investigation and review determined that BOP employees did not take steps to 
ensure that Jeffrey Epstein continuously had a cellmate in response to Psychology Department personnel 
having determined that he needed to have an appropriate cellmate, and absent any indication that security 
or other considerations relating to Epstein warranted his not having a cellmate.  
The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) develops the recommended 
procedures; (2) provides the procedures to the OIG; and (3) implements the procedures. 
Recommendation 3:  The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting 
approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation, 
which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and provide guidance on standard 
components that each institution should include in its process to mitigate security issues that can 
arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. 
Status:  Resolved. 
BOP Response:  The BOP reported the following: 
The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
OIG Analysis:  The BOP concurred with this recommendation but did not provide any additional 
information.  The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) evaluates the 
current process for obtaining and documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on 
suicide watch or psychological observation; (2) provides guidance on standard components that each 
institution should include it is process; and (3) provides to the OIG documentation of the evaluation and the 
guidance forwarded to institutions for inclusion in their institution-specific processes. 
Recommendation 4: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts 
and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods through policy, 
training, or other measures. 
Status:  Resolved. 
BOP Response:  The BOP reported the following: 
The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 

120 
OIG Analysis:  The BOP concurred with this recommendation but did not provide any additional 
information.  The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) evaluates its 
methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing; (2) makes any appropriate changes to 
improve those methods through policy, training, or other measures; and (3) provides documentation of 
evaluation and any appropriate changes to the OIG. 
Recommendation 5:  BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a 
round. 
Status:  Resolved. 
BOP Response:  The BOP reported the following: 
The BOP concurs with this recommendation. 
OIG Analysis:  The BOP concurred with this recommendation but did not provide any additional 
information.  The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) updates its 
policy to clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round; (2) communicates the policy 
update to all relevant BOP employees; and (3) provides documentation of the policy update and 
communication to the OIG. 
Recommendation 6: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing 
shortages at its prisons. 
Status:  Resolved. 
BOP Response:  The BOP reported the following: 
The BOP concurs with this recommendation.  Hiring and retaining qualified personnel is a key 
priority and BOP has developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach that involves

DEP ARTM EN T OF JUSTICE |  O FFICE O F T HE INSP ECTO R GENER AL 
June 27, 2023 
DOJ OIG Releases Report on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in New York, New York 
Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today the release of a report 
of investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey 
Epstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New 
York).  Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019 while in BOP custody.  The focus of DOJ Office of the 
Inspector General’s (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel.   
The DOJ OIG investigation and review identified:   
• 
Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff.  The DOJ OIG found numerous and serious 
failures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties.  Among other 
things, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive 
amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in 
his locked cell on August 10 at approximately 6:30 a.m.   
o 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate.   Following a July 23, 
2019, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York 
Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate 
cellmate.  On August 9, Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York.  MCC New York 
staff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was 
assigned a new cellmate. 
o 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein 
and Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe.  BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit 
(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells, 
and ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s 
death failed to carry out these responsibilities.  Specifically, only one SHU cell search was 
documented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell.  BOP records did not indicate when 
Epstein’s cell was last searched.  Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would 
have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.  The OIG 
also found that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds after about 10:40 p.m. on 
August 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:00 p.m. on 
August 9.  MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to show that they had been 
performed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his 
death.  Following a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged 
criminally with falsifying BOP records.  The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the 
employees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  That office declined prosecution for 

other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier 
dates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death. 
o 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera System was Fully 
Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence.  BOP policy also requires SHU staff to 
ensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system.  This investigation and review 
revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York’s security camera system.  Although 
video cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies 
resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to 
not record video starting in late July 2019 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.   
• 
Long-standing Operational Challenges.  The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing 
operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and 
securely.  Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing 
inmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures, 
and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during 
this investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most 
high profile inmates. 
• 
No Evidence Contradicting the FBI’s Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with 
Epstein’s Death.  Separate from the OIG’s investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP 
personnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal 
conduct by any non-BOP actors.  Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s 
death and determined it was not the result of a criminal act.  The Office of the Chief Medical 
Examiner, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide.  While the OIG determined 
MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not 
uncover evidence contradicting the FBI’s determination regarding the absence of criminality in 
connection with Epstein’s death.   
The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the 
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s 
custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life.  The BOP’s failures are troubling not only 
because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to 
questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous 
victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.  The fact that these failures 
have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for 
DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP. 
The DOJ OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional 
institutions.  The BOP agreed with all recommendations.

“A Message from the Inspector General:  Investigation and Review on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and 
Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York,” June 
2023   
Hello, I’m Michael Horowitz, Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Justice.   
Today my office released a report on the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or BOP’s, custody, care, and supervision 
of inmate Jeffrey Epstein at the MCC New York. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanged in his locked 
cell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit.  The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical 
Examiner determined that Epstein died by suicide. 
Today’s report follows numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified 
long-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely 
and securely.  Today’s report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job 
performance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies; 
and deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at 
risk for suicide.    
For example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as 
instructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department following an incident on July 23rd where Epstein was 
found unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck.  In addition, we concluded that MCC 
New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were 
accounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells.  Had Epstein's 
cell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and 
clothing in his cell.  MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution’s security camera system 
was fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.  
While we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence 
contradicting the FBI’s determination that there was no criminality in connection with how Epstein died.   
The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s 
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s 
custody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him 
with the opportunity to take his own life.  The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not 
adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the 
circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the 
opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.   
The fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and 
gives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.

Thank you for joining me today.

February 27, 2025 
Before you came into office, I requested the full and complete files related to Jeffrey 
Epstein. In response to this request, I received approximately 200 pages of documents, which 
consisted primarily of flight logs, Epstein's list ofcontacts, and a list of victims' names and 
phone numbers. 
I repeatedly questioned whether this was the full set of documents responsive to my 
request and was repeatedly assured by the FBI that we had received the full set of documents. 
Lateyesterday; I learned from a source that the FBI Field Office inNew York was in possession 
of thousands of pages of documents related. to the investigation and indictment. of Epstein. 
Despite my repeated requests, the FBI never disclosed the existence of these files. 'When ydii 
and I spoke yesterday, you wetejustas surprised as I was to learn this newirtforrrtation.
