INTRODUCTION 
INDICTMENT 
830 
1. 
On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
THOMAS, 
the 
defendants, 
in dereliction 
of their duties 
as 
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners 
under their watch in the MCC' s Special Housing Unit 
("SHU"). 
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS 
sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the 
common area of the SHU. 
To conceal their failure to perform their 
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in 
truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. 
As a result 
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as 
a result of the defendants' 
conduct, 
no correctional officer 
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 2 of 20
p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
of an MCC 
inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
overnight while unobserved. 
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
2. 
The 
MCC 
is a 
federal administrative detention 
facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons ("BOP"). 
The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. 
The MCC 
employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the 
care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
3. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. 
As of 
August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. 
On August 9, 
2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. 
NOEL had also worked a regular 
shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
p.m. 
4. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
a 
correctional officer at the 
MCC 
since approximately 2007. 
Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work as a 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 3 of 20
materials handler supervisor, al though THOMAS regularly worked 
overtime shifts as a correctional officer, including in the SHU. 
THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU on August 10, 2019, 
from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
THOMAS did not work his regular shift on 
August 8 or August 9, 2019, but did work an overtime shift in the 
SHU on August 9, 2019 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
5. 
As 
detailed 
herein, 
Jeffrey 
Epstein 
was 
incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
his suicide on August 10, 2019. 
Epstein was detained pending 
trial in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking 
charges. 
THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
6. 
The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
the MCC. 
The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
(the "Control Centern), which is located on the first floor of the 
MCC. 
Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 4 of 20
keys while on duty. 
Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
have keys while on duty. 
Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell -
which is made of cement and metal -
is accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
7. 
The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
is alive and accounted for within the MCC 
(the "institutional 
count") 
On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. 
Performing an 
institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. 
Two 
officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
housing unit, including the SHU, 
and are further required to 
document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
called a count slip. 
To perform the institutional count in the 
SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
each individual inmate. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 5 of 20
8. 
On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. 
Once the correctional 
officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips 
are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. 
Only after 
all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
roster, 
can the institutional count 
deemed 
"cleared" or 
completed. 
incomplete, 
If a 
housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
then the 
institution cannot 
"clear" 
the 
count. 
Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
"bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
inmate to the institution's inmate roster. 
Records of each 
institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
9. 
In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
the tiers of the SHU -
which is called a "round" -
every thirty 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 6 of 20
minutes 
("30-minute rounds"). 
Like the institutional counts, 
correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. 
Correctional 
officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
10. On 
July 
6, 
2019, 
inmate 
Jeffrey Epstein 
was 
arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. 
On 
July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
responded to the incident. 
Epstein was subsequently transferred 
out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. 
Inmates placed 
on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
of the MCC, 
and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
twenty-four hours, 
and then was transferred to psychological 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 7 of 20
observation, until July 30, 2019. 
Psychological observation is 
less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
in the hospital wing of the MCC and watched twenty-four hours a 
day. 
13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
the SHU, and, at the direction of the MCC's psychological staff, 
was required to have an assigned cellmate. 
Epstein was also 
assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
from the cell. 
Conducting the required institutional counts and 
thirty-minute rounds in the SHU 
were also part of the MCC' s 
procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
14. On 
August 
9, 
2019, 
Epstein's 
cellmate 
was 
transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer at 
approximately 8 a .m. 
Despite the MCC' s psychological staff's 
direction that Epstein have a 
cellmate, 
no new cellmate· was 
assigned to Epstein's cell. 
15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
officers on duty in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
a.m. on August 10. 
From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., two other officers 
were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 8 of 20
assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2") 
MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on 
August 10. 
From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS 
were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 
a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. 
NOEL, THOMAS and 
the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. 
While, as detailed 
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
17. TOVA 
NOEL, 
the 
defendant, 
and 
Officer-1 
were 
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. 
As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
performed. 
In 
reliance 
on 
that 
falsified 
count 
slip, 
at 
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
count. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 9 of 20
18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. 
NOEL 
and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
immediately thereafter. 
19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
locked in their cells for the night. 
At or around that time, TOVA 
NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. 
However, video from 
the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
Officer-2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL 
and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. 
In 
reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
20. As 
reflected on video obtained from the MCC' s 
internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019 -
after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and 
submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had 
been completed -
NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back 
from, 
the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. 
As 
confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC' s internal video 
surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 10 of 20
correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only 
entrance 
to 
the 
tier 
in 
which 
Epstein 
was 
housed 
until 
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
21. Officer-1' s shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
and at approximately 12 a.m., 
MICHAEL 
THOMAS, 
the defendant, 
replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the MCC' s internal video 
surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
slip for 
the 
a.m. 
count 
that 
falsely stated that the 
institutional count had been performed. 
In reliance on that 
falsified count slip, at approximately 12: 49 a.m., the Control 
Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
22. 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts in the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the 
MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
falsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts. 
In reliance on those falsified count slips, 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 11 of 20
at approximately 3:24 a.m. 
and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. 
Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
24. During 
the 
night, 
instead 
of 
completing 
the 
required counts and rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, 
the 
defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
SHU 
common area 
(as noted above, 
approximately 15 feet from 
Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
common area. 
For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
asleep. 
NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
including to search the internet for furniture sales and benefit 
websites. 
THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk, 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 12 of 20
before leaving. 
At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. 
Aside from 
those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
else entered the SHU, 
no one conducted any counts or rounds 
throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
was housed. 
26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
THOMAS 
and TOVA NOEL, 
the defendants, received a delivery of 
breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
only officers in the SHU. 
Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
serve breakfast. 
At approximately 6:33 a.m., 
an alarm was 
activated in the SHU. 
Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
responsive, with a noose around his neck. 
A supervisor who had 
just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
that 
"Epstein 
hung 
himself." 
After arriving in the 
SHU, 
Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. 
NOEL told Supervisor-1 
"we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." 
THOMAS stated, 
"we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
any rounds." 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 1     Filed 11/19/19     Page 13 of 20
27. Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
he was declared dead shortly thereafter. 
The Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner of the City of New York conducted an autopsy and 
determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself.

(Case called) 
MR. ROOS:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Nicolas Roos
and Rebekah Donaleski for the United States.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. FOY:  May it please the Court, your Honor, my name
is Jason Foy, attorney for Ms. Tovah Noel, standing to my left.
Good afternoon, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you.  Good
afternoon.
MR. FIGGINS:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Montel
Figgins, from the Law Offices of Montel Figgins, on behalf of
Michael Thomas, who's standing to my left.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Good afternoon to all of you.
My name is Judge Netburn.
Can I have the date and time of the defendants'
arrests?
MR. ROOS:  Both defendants self-surrendered to the FBI
this morning at approximately 10:00 a.m.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
The purpose of today's proceeding is to advise you of
certain rights that you have, inform you of the charges against
you, consider whether counsel shall be appointed for you, and
decide under what conditions, if any, you shall be released.
I'm now going to explain certain constitutional rights
that you have.

            (212) 805-0300
JBJKNOEN                 
You have the right to remain silent.  You are not
required to make any statements.  Even if you have already made
statements to the authorities, you need not make any further
statements.  Any statements that you do make can be used
against you.
You have the right to be released, either
conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find
that there are no conditions that would reasonably assure your
presence in court or the safety of the community.
You have the right to be represented by an attorney
during all court proceedings, including this one and during all
questioning by the authorities.
If you cannot afford an attorney, I will appoint one
to represent you.  I understand that each of you has retained
private counsel.  If at any point in time you run out of money
and you are unable to afford counsel, you can petition the
Court to appoint counsel at the government's expense and at no
cost to you.
You both have been charged in a six-count indictment,
and I will just state that I understand that Judge Torres has
referred this not just for presentment but also for
arraignment.
MR. ROOS:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  The defendants have both been charged in a
six-count indictment.

            (212) 805-0300

Count One charges the defendants with conspiracy in
violation of Title 18 of United States Code, Section 371.  And
Counts Two through Six each charge an individual act of false
records in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections
1001(a)(3) and (2).
Let me ask, Ms. Noel, have you received a copy of this
indictment?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Have you had an opportunity to review it
and discuss the charges with your lawyer?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Would you like me to read the indictment
to you in open court?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  No, thank you.
THE COURT:  How do you plead to the charges?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  Not guilty.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
DEFENDANT NOEL:  You're welcome.
THE COURT:  Mr. Thomas, I'm going to ask you the same
questions.
Have you received a copy of the indictment?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Have you had an opportunity to read the
indictment and discuss the charges with your lawyer?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Would you like me to read the indictment
to you in open court?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  How do you plead to the charges?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  Not guilty, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Be seated.
Have the parties discussed an appropriate bail
package?
MR. ROOS:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Shall we begin with Ms. Noel?
MR. ROOS:  Certainly, your Honor.  I actually think
the bail packages are nearly identical with the exception of
one or two conditions that are set forth in the pretrial
services report, so maybe I'll first give your Honor all of the
conditions that are the same for each of the defendants and I
will note the variation at the end.
For both defendants, it's $100,000 bond, secured by
two financially responsible persons and their own signature;
pretrial supervision, as directed; surrender of travel
documents, and no new applications; no contact with
codefendants; surrender of firearms.
For travel restrictions, for Defendant Thomas, it will
be Southern District of New York, Eastern District of New York,
and the District of New Jersey.
And for Defendant Noel, it will be Southern District

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
JBJKNOEN                 
of New York, Eastern District of New York, District of New
Jersey, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
And then the special conditions that are set forth in
the pretrial reports, it's condition number 4, relating to use
of alcohol for Defendant Thomas, and condition 7 for Defendant
Noel, which relates to mental health evaluation and treatment
as directed by pretrial services.
And, finally, your Honor, that they be both released
today on their own signature.
THE COURT:  And how long do the parties propose to
satisfy the balance of the conditions?
MR. ROOS:  A week is appropriate, your Honor, for the
two cosigners.
THE COURT:  Any objection from defendants?
MR. FIGGINS:  No, your Honor.
MR. FOY:  There is one.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. FOY:  Before today's proceedings, we did have an
agreement on the terms of release.  And, of course, as part of
that process, pretrial services is involved and they're not
necessarily privy to the terms of our agreement.  And I
understand that we've added some things that were not part of
the agreement, and I'm fine with that.  But there's one
condition I'm not fine with and I'd like your Honor to
consider.

            (212) 805-0300
JBJKNOEN                 
With regards to the surrender of firearm, I'm asking
that your Honor not make that a requirement of her release.  I
ask that because - in this nonviolent allegation, in which no
firearm was involved, with a history of having no criminal
record of any kind or any history of violence - she, who
legally possesses and has a permit for the firearm, should
still be able to possess her firearm because she's not a
convicted felon and someone who's not permitted to do so.
She's --
THE COURT:  Is that a duty firearm or personal use?
MR. FOY:  Personal.
So that's the only issue that I have, because I think
that at this time, to sacrifice that right that she legally
has, and has complied with everything that it means to have
that firearm, that she still be able to do so.  I could imagine
that there could be an argument about safety of others;
however, there's nothing to really corroborate the fact that
her continuing to possess her firearm, just like she has in the
past, would actually endanger anyone.  We voluntarily
surrendered.  We participated in a pretrial interview.  There's
just no reason for it, other than probably a policy that says
that's what they would like to do.
Now, it's a meaningful one, I'm not saying that it's a
bad thing, but under the unique circumstances here, in this
case, in the history and type of case that it is, I'm asking
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 14     Filed 12/16/19     Page 7 of 12

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
JBJKNOEN                 
that that one condition be withheld and with all the other
conditions being fine.
THE COURT:  Just so I understand your argument, you
would like your client to retain her personal-use firearm
because she otherwise has the right to do so?  She doesn't need
it for any particular reason?
MR. FOY:  Well, I suppose a person who has a firearm
may feel that they need it for their self-protection.  Now, I'm
not suggesting that there's been some specific threat or
anything, other than the world is crazy, but if she hasn't done
anything improper with regards to that important right, it
shouldn't be sacrificed now, at an arraignment, as a condition
of her release, when she has fully cooperated with everything
up until this point.  We've been in communication with the
government since August 14th, and communicated about her
international travel since this investigation began.  All we've
done is comply and put the government on notice as to her
whereabouts and what's going on.  We've been completely
cooperative in that respect.
But when you talk about removing someone's personal
firearm, that they legally possess in their home - she doesn't
have a license to carry it anywhere, just in her home - unless
there is a reason connected to the case, to the crime, that
suggests that it could be in fact a danger to a third party or
someone else, then, in that case, I would understand, but not
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 14     Filed 12/16/19     Page 8 of 12

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
JBJKNOEN                 
in this kind of case, which is an allegation about documents.
THE COURT:  Understood.  Thank you.
I have a few responses.  The first is, although I
greatly appreciate when the parties are able to reach agreement
on the terms of a defendant's release, that agreement is
meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling.  I
ultimately decide how defendants should be released.  And there
have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement
between the parties.  So the fact that you and the government
reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be
imposed may be different than that agreement.  It's simply, the
way that court proceeds.  And the fact of the agreement - while
very helpful and I appreciate it, and it suggests that the
parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean
that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.
The second thing to say with respect to the issue of
firearms is that it is in fact a policy.  It's not a policy of
the U.S. Attorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial
service office, because they are going to be sending officers
in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you
said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety
concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety
concerns about Ms. Noel.  And, as you point out, this case is
not a violent case and there are not allegations that your
client has engaged in violence, either in connection with this
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 14     Filed 12/16/19     Page 9 of 12

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
JBJKNOEN                 
case or in her history, but I need to be concerned about
sending law enforcement officers who work for the Court, who
are going to be supervising your client, and it is for their
safety that we impose that condition.
So I am going to impose the condition.  I am going to
require your client to surrender her firearm.  Both defendants
will have to surrender their firearms and their permits so that
they can't secure new firearms.  That is a safety precaution
that we undertake to protect our people who are going to be
enforcing the terms of this release.  It has nothing to do with
the government per se.
So with that, I will release the defendants today on
their own signature and the posting of $100,000 bond that needs
to be secured by two financially responsible cosigners.
You're going to report, each of you, to your pretrial
officer, as directed.
I believe you've surrendered your travel documents,
your passports, and the like.  If you haven't, you need to
surrender your travel documents, and you're prohibited from
making any new travel applications.
Each of you is prohibited from having contact with the
other, meaning your codefendant, except in the presence of
counsel.  As I just stated, each of you needs to surrender any
firearms, both personal use and duty firearms, and the permits
that authorize those, to pretrial.

With respect to travel for Mr. Thomas, your travel
will be restricted to the Southern District of New York, the
Eastern District of New York, and the District of New Jersey.
And for Ms. Noel, your travel will be restricted to
the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the District of
New Jersey and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
In addition, I'm imposing the requirement for
Mr. Thomas that he refrain from the excessive use of alcohol,
and, for Ms. Noel, the requirement that she -- I'm going to
give the authority to pretrial to determine whether or not a
mental health evaluation or support is needed, but that will be
at the direction of your pretrial services officer.
Let me warn each of you that if you fail to appear in
court or if you violate any of the conditions of your release,
a warrant will be issued for your arrest, and you and anybody
who cosigned the bond may be responsible for paying its full
amount, which is $100,000, and you will be charged with a
separate crime of bail-jumping.
In addition, if you commit an offense while you're on
pretrial supervision, you may be subject to a more severe
punishment than you would receive if you committed the very
same offense at any other time.
Has Judge Torres set the next conference date?
MR. ROOS:  Yes, your Honor.  The judge set it for
November 25, 2019.

And the government would move to exclude time between
today's date and that date so that the government may produce
discovery and the defense may begin to review the discovery.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Any objections from defense counsel?
MR. FOY:  No, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  No, Judge.  I think there is just an
issue of the timing of the court date.  The time --
THE COURT:  You should just reach out to Judge Torres'
deputy.  I'm sure, if necessary, it can be rescheduled.  For
now, I'm going to exclude time, on defendants' consent, from
today to November 25th.
Anything further from either side?
MR. ROOS:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
MR. FOY:  No, thank you, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  No, Judge.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you, everybody.

THE COURT:  Good afternoon.
We're here in the matter of United States v. Tova Noel
and Michael Thomas.
Would you make your appearances, please.
MS. DONALESKI:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Rebekah
Donaleski and Nicolas Roos for the government.
MR. FOY:  My name is Jason Foy, attorney for Ms. Noel.
Good afternoon, your Honor.
THE DEFENDANT:  Good afternoon, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Montel
Figgins on behalf of Michael Thomas, who is presently in court,
standing to my left.
THE COURT:  Please be seated.
Has the prosecutor finished delivering discovery to
the defendants?
MS. DONALESKI:  No, your Honor.
The defendants self-surrendered last Tuesday, on
November 19.  They were presented and arraigned that day.  We
notified defense counsel we would begin producing discovery
once a protective order is in place, and we will do so on a
rolling basis.
THE COURT:  When do you expect to be finished?
MS. DONALESKI:  We anticipate that we'll need a month
to complete production of the discovery currently in our
possession.

JbpWnoeC                 
THE COURT:  When do you expect the protective order to
be in place?
MS. DONALESKI:  Your Honor, we'll provide a draft to
defense counsel within the next day, and then depending on how
long it takes for them to comment on it and the parties to
reach a resolution, we'll provide it to the Court as
expeditiously as possible, so it's my hope that that can happen
within a week.
THE COURT:  All right.  By the end of December,
discovery should have been produced.  Is that correct?
MS. DONALESKI:  That's fine, your Honor.
THE COURT:  It's not voluminous, is it?
MS. DONALESKI:  Your Honor, it will consist of
hundreds of hours of video recording, so in that aspect it will
be voluminous, but the paper records, the bank records will not
be voluminous.
THE COURT:  All right.  It doesn't seem that you would
need more than a month to review the discovery so that by the
end of January, you should have made decisions as to whether
you're going to be filing motions.  Correct?
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor, if I may?
I also know that there's an ongoing inspector
general's report.  I don't have any idea as to the time frame,
if and when that's going to be completed.  I do believe that
there would be some pertinent information, relevant information
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 17     Filed 12/19/19     Page 3 of 15

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
 (212) 805-0300
JbpWnoeC                 
in that report, so if we could get some -- if they have any
idea as to when that's going to conclude, I do believe that
that may have some impact in terms of information that we
desire to have as well as I do believe that we're also going to
be subpoenaing some documents as well.  But I don't think we
would need more than the end of January, presumably, to have an
idea to convey to the Court where we are with respect to moving
forward with motions.
MS. DONALESKI:  Your Honor, we'll provide the
discovery in our possession to the defendants by the end of
December.  I don't know of a basis to hold up a criminal case
based on a DOJ inspector general report, and I don't have a
time line of when that will be completed.
MR. FOY:  Your Honor, I agree that by the end of
January we should be in a position to assess what motions, if
any, will be necessary.  We'll also be in a position to
determine whether there are any issues regard to discovery or
additional information at that point.
MR. FIGGINS:  And your Honor --
THE COURT:  One moment, please.
You'll return to court on January 30 at 11 a.m. --
that will be a control date -- and you'll let me know whether
you expect to file motions.
Now, with respect to a trial date, April 20.
MR. FIGGINS:  That's fine for us.

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

JbpWnoeC                 
MS. DONALESKI:  That's fine for the government, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  How long do you expect the trial to last?
MR. FOY:  Your Honor, I would say it's fine.  I mean,
as it looks right now, but based on some of the things I'm
anticipating, I don't know if that would be enough time and
maybe we want to wait and see, because I need to see the
discovery before I can say definitively that, yes, April 20 is
an appropriate date.  But for now certainly that would be fair.
THE COURT:  We're told that the discovery consists of
video and documents.  I don't understand why you can't
anticipate whether you can go forward on the 20th.
MR. FOY:  Because I haven't seen what those documents
are and what impact it might have on the defense of the case as
well as my thoughts on some additional documents that may go
beyond what they believe Rule 16 requires.  I can imagine a
situation where we feel that there's more to be provided than
what the government provides.  We're not there yet, so I'm not
suggesting that it's definitely going to be an issue, but I did
want to alert the Court early on of the possibility.  But once
I get the discovery, I'll be in a position to say more
affirmatively.
THE COURT:  What else are you expecting?
MR. FOY:  You mean as far as discovery?
THE COURT:  You're talking in vague terms about
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 17     Filed 12/19/19     Page 5 of 15

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
 (212) 805-0300
JbpWnoeC                 
something else coming up, and I'd like to know what that is.
MR. FOY:  Well, your Honor, based on our view of the
case, I believe there are outside circumstances that are
driving this prosecution that may impact certain information
that's available to us in the regular discovery.
It's hard for me to say without seeing anything, so
right now it's just kind of in my mind, and I don't want to
mislead the Court to suggest it's all going to be finished in
time for April 20.  It may be, and that may be fine, but it's
hard for me to say having not received or reviewed the
discovery.  I've only seen the indictment.
I'm just alerting the Court.  I'm not saying we can't
do it, but I don't want to not say it when it's something that
could potentially be an issue.  I'm not saying we're trying to
hold it up or slow down the pace unnecessarily, but I can see
getting information that may impact on the defense in
particular, Brady material in particular.
THE COURT:  Brady material?
MR. FOY:  Correct, but it's hard to say specifically
without seeing the discovery.
THE COURT:  All right.  You have not persuaded me.
I'm setting the trial for April 20.
How long do you expect the trial to go?
MS. DONALESKI:  Approximately a week, your Honor, for
the government's case.

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
 (212) 805-0300
JbpWnoeC                 
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor, I would think it would
probably be about five days on our case.
And your Honor, I did want to ask the Court or we
would like to at least get some type of idea with respect to
the status of the inspector general's report.  I do think that
it's beyond relevant; it's an investigation into what happened
here.  There's going to be multiple details of information and
interviews and statements and things of that nature regarding
this particular case, so on and so forth.  So I would ask at
least the Court to see if we can get a time frame from the
government if that report is going to be imminently due or what
type of time frame we're looking at, because I do believe there
are going to be a lot of relevant facts in that report, that we
would need that information.  And then we would need time to
then maybe even investigate based on some of that information.
THE COURT:  Does the government know anything about
that?
MS. DONALESKI:  Your Honor, I don't.  And I'll just
clarify that to the extent counsel's asking for a summary of
the results of the criminal investigation, obviously we'll be
turning over in discovery all of the underlying results of the
criminal investigation.  So I'm a little puzzled as to what
defense counsel is saying that he needs.  I don't have a time
frame on the inspector general report, but the government will
produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery materials

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

JbpWnoeC                 
in this matter, which includes the Rule 16 materials relevant
to the criminal charges that have been brought against the
defendants.
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor, to be more specific, one of
the issues here is going to be the conditions and the
supervision and the policies that were upheld and advanced by
the Bureau of Prisons.  That is what the inspector general's
report is investigating.  That's very important information
that's relevant to this case and relevant to the defense.  I'm
not saying we have to hold up our case forever, but we should
at least get some type of idea as to the status of that report
and when it's going to come out or when they're going to
complete the actual report because I believe that there's going
to be a lot of information that may be relevant to our defense,
and it may not be specifically just about this particular
investigation.
There's been multiple information in the media now
with respect to testimony by the head of the Bureau of Prisons,
information released by the U.S. Attorney himself regarding
this investigation with respect to this case, so I believe that
we will need that information.  If we're hearing that those
people are making statements about that report with respect to
this case, clearly there's going to be information and
potentially statements and other information that we may need.
So I think it's important that we at least try to get an idea

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
 (212) 805-0300
JbpWnoeC                 
of when that report may be completed.
THE COURT:  I'm putting the matter on for trial on the
20th of April.  It's a firm date, and I am giving you two weeks
for trial.
Are there any further applications?
MS. DONALESKI:  The government moves to exclude time
between today's date and April 20, 2020, in order to allow the
defendants to review discovery and prepare for trial.
MR. FOY:  Yes, I do have another application, your
Honor.
As I alerted the Court prior to today's court
proceedings, I wanted to revisit the issue of the release
conditions for Ms. Noel at this time.
On November 19, we appeared before the magistrate
court.  The government and Ms. Noel had an agreement with
regards to the bail package.  After our interview with pretrial
services, they added additional conditions that were not a part
of the original agreement.  Of the additional conditions, one
of them was travel restrictions.
One of the permissible areas at the time that was
stated on the record was the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Turns out that it should be the Middle District of Pennsylvania
instead of the eastern, so I'd like that to be corrected.  But
the second issue, which is really the main subject of this
application, is with regards to the surrender of her firearms,
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 17     Filed 12/19/19     Page 9 of 15

 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
 (212) 805-0300
JbpWnoeC                 
which Ms. Noel has already complied with.
During the proceedings before the magistrate court, I
presented arguments in favor of her ability to keep her
firearm.  I'm asking for this Court to reconsider that decision
and provide an individualized assessment of whether that
condition is appropriate under the circumstances of this case.
Your Honor, this case involves allegations of
nonviolent criminal conduct.  I do not believe that there's a
controversy of whether she's a flight risk or danger to the
community.  What has been said to me with regards to why the
application for the firearm has been made by pretrial services
is to make them more comfortable so when they come to the home
there's not a firearm in the home.
I do appreciate the fact that pretrial services needs
to be safe, and I don't deny that.  However, when it comes to
infringing upon her Second Amendment right to possess her
firearm that she has legally, that's personal to her, I also
would like to make one correction in the record from my
previous presentation, because I indicated to the Court at that
time that she possessed it legally and that she just has it for
the home.
Well, it turns out she does have credentials to
actually carry her firearm in public as it relates to her job.
I suspect that that could change if something happened with her
job as a result of these proceedings, but that wouldn't change

her ability to actually possess her firearm should her job
status change, meaning there may become a change in her ability
to carry it publicly because of a change of job situation, but
it won't impact her constitutional right to actually bear arms.
Under 3142, the Court should consider the least
restrictive methods, in this case, I think, address the safety
issue being raised by pretrial services.
If you look at Ms. Noel's history and character, she
doesn't have a prior criminal record.  She has no history of
violence or bad conduct that might indicate that she is a
physical threat, that she would use her firearm against another
unwarrantedly.
The pretrial services report was done by the person
who's going to supervise her.  I've had an opportunity to speak
to pretrial services about this application, that I would be
making this application, and fortunately, having worked with
the pretrial services officer, he respectfully disagreed with
my position and mentioned to me that one of the concerns is
what happens if I come to the home and the gun is out?  That's
a problem.
Well, it could be a problem, I suppose, but it's not
like a dog who has its own will and may go bite someone.  In
fact, I submit to the Court that if my client had a dog that
wasn't friendly to strangers, that one of the remedies we would
say is when they come from pretrial services, you have to put

the dog away.  What I'm suggesting to your Honor in the least
restrictive manner is that we can make sure that if anyone from
pretrial services comes to the home, that she will secure the
gun away so that it's not out, since that seems to be their
concern.
She doesn't have any ill will towards the court staff
or anyone a part of this process.  She understands what she
needs to do.  There is no actual, credible, competent threat
supported by evidence to suggest that at this time her
constitutional right to possess her weapon should be infringed
at this time.
I suppose there could come a time where that could
change, but when we take it now, without an individual
assessment of her particulars, her background, the specific
circumstances of the case, then it gives the impression as if
the conclusion's foregone that she should be -- meaning in this
case -- a felon deprived of her firearm.  She's not.  She
remains innocent as we sit here today, and the fact that she's
here is disappointing, but we're here, so we have to deal with
it.
All I'm asking for is fair consideration in an
individualized way.  Any concern that your Honor has about her
possessing a firearm, I'd welcome you to address it with me so
I have an opportunity to directly speak to your concerns.
THE COURT:  I'll hear from the government.

MS. DONALESKI:  Your Honor, with respect to modifying
the travel restrictions, we have no objection to including her
travel restriction to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
With respect to the firearm, defense counsel raised
this in front of Judge Netburn last week, who had the
opportunity to consult with pretrial services.  She denied this
request, as your Honor should do.
We respectfully submit it is due to the safety
concerns of pretrial services that the defendant should not be
permitted to possess her firearm.  The pretrial services
officers have to go into the defendant's home, including at
unscheduled visits, and due to their safety concerns with
having a defendant who has access to a firearm and they may not
know where the firearm is in the home, it's entirely reasonable
for pretrial services to say as a policy defendants have to
surrender their firearms.
This is done in every case, your Honor, including law
enforcement officers who are on pretrial services supervision.
Defendants are required to give their firearms back or to
surrender their firearms simply for the safety of the pretrial
services officers who are going into their homes.  And given
that safety concern, we believe that it is appropriate, as
Judge Netburn found, for that to be a condition of her release.
THE COURT:  The removal of the firearm is a
commonsense safety measure.  The application is denied.

Are there any further applications?
MR. FIGGINS:  Yes, your Honor.
With respect to Mr. Thomas, last week, we asked for a
week to get two additional cosigners.  I would just ask the
Court to give us another seven days.  I've submitted the
information to the U.S. Attorney's Office, but they still need
to conduct their interview.  I just don't want there to be any
issues with respect to having it completed by tomorrow, so I
would just ask the Court to extend it another seven days with
respect to getting those signers and getting it approved.
MS. DONALESKI:  We have no objection to that, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  That deadline is extended by a
week.  And I certainly have no objection to the Middle District
of Pennsylvania being included in those areas where Ms. Noel is
permitted to travel.
Is there anything further?
MS. DONALESKI:  We'll just request a ruling on our
application to exclude time, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Yes.  The application is granted.  Time is
excluded.
Is that without objection?
MR. FOY:  That is without objection, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  That's fine, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Time is excluded under the Speedy Trial

Act until April 20, 2020.  I find that the ends of justice
served by excluding such time outweigh the interests of the
public and the defendants in a speedy trial because this will
allow time for the prosecution to produce discovery, for the
defense to consider it, to decide whether to prepare motions,
and for the parties to discuss a possible disposition.
The defendants' bail status shall remain the same.
The matter is adjourned.

Re: 
US v. Tova Noel, et al 
Docket # 19 cr. 830 (AT) 
Request to Adjourn Trial Date 
Dear Judge Torres: 
On November 25, 2019, during the initial status conference the Court scheduled the 
above referenced criminal action for trial to commence on April 20, 2020.  I am 
requesting that the trial date be postponed to sometime in October or a date 
thereafter that is convenient for the Court. 
The adjournment is necessary to ensure that Ms. Noel receives adequate and effective 
assistance of counsel.  The postponement of the trial will allow for the defense to 
review voluminous discovery and conduct a defense investigation of the case. 
On November 22, 2019, I informed the Government that I would provide them with 
a hard drive during the November 25, 2019 initial status conference.  On November 
25, 2019, I provided the Government with a hard drive for discovery and the 
Government informed the Court that they would produce discovery in 30 days.  The 
Government forwarded discovery on the hard drive to my office on December 31, 
2019.  The discovery was received by my office on January 2, 2020.  On January 4, 
2020, I attempted to review the discovery and I could not access it because the 
Government provided the incorrect password to get access.  On January 6, 2020, I 
was provided with the correct password and gained my first access to the discovery. 
The discovery contained in the initial production is 877GB of materials.  The 877GB 
of materials contains up to 8118 Bates of global discovery and up to 20,853 Bates of 
individual discovery.  In folder marked SDNY_00000001, there is video surveillance 
capturing 3 separate cameras from July 5, 2019 thru August 12, 2019.  Each date 
allegedly contains the 24-hour period for each day, from each camera, and in 1-hour 
increments per individual file.  Note, that there is video surveillance in the 
Government’s possession that has not been turned over, however, the Government

FOY & SEPLOWITZ LLC 
Attorneys at Law 
Page 2 
indicated that those video surveillance files will be turned over upon request.  
Furthermore, SDNY_7549-8118 contains the interviews of approximately 29 
employees and 14 inmates.  It will be necessary to interview many, if not all the 
witnesses previously interviewed by the Government. 
A review of the video surveillance turned over reveals that most of the videos are not 
date or time stamped.  After discussions with the Government, on January 21, 2020, 
I provided the Government with a flash drive to reproduce the same video 
surveillance contained in SDNY_00000001 with the date and time stamps.  On 
January 22, 2020, the Government received the flash drive and advised my office that 
the flash drive was not functioning properly.  On January 23, 2020, I forwarded a 
1TB hard drive to the Government to provide the requested materials.  Based upon 
representations made by the Government, I expect to receive the hard drive back by 
January 27, 2020. 
On January 24, 2020, my office received additional discovery from the Government.  
The additional discovery increased the global discovery Bates number to 8132. 
Based upon the volume of discovery received to date, defendant Noel is not able to 
determine what motions or legal issues she will raise.  I anticipate making additional 
requests for discovery or information, however, I will need significant time to review 
and digest the discovery to have an appreciation of what materials we do have and 
what materials we do not have that we are entitled to. 
I will be prepared to discuss this issue in further detail during our upcoming status 
conference on January 30, 2020 at 11:00am.  Thank you for your thoughtful 
consideration.

Re: 
State of NY v Michael Thomas, et al. 
Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830 
Adjournment Request 
Dear Hon. Judge Torres: 
Pursuant to the Court’s request, I am making a written request that the April 20, 2020 
trial date be adjourned for at least 6 months. Firstly, the government in this matter sent out 
discovery on or about December 31, 2019. It was received in my office over the holiday break 
when no one was working. Thereafter, there was an issue with me being able to access the drive 
containing all of the information proffered by the government because we were given the wrong 
password by the government. Accordingly, I have had only about two weeks to review the 
voluminous discovery provided.  
The discovery ostensibly contains approximately 25,000 documents and hundreds of 
hours of video footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I will need at least an 
additional 60 days to review the discovery and discuss it with my client. Thereafter, I will still 
need to conduct an investigation based on the information and witness statements detailed in the 
discovery. Such an undertaking will take at the minimum another 60 days. As the Court can see, 
it will take me 90 days or more before I am in a position to know what additional discovery may 
be needed or what motions are appropriate. Additionally, this timeline doesn’t even account for 
issues regarding subpoenas, requests for additional discovery and attempting to locate witnesses 
or hire experts.

As previously noted, I intend on filing a motion for dismissal based on selective 
prosecution. If successful, this motion will entitle my client to additional discovery beyond what 
has previously been provided which also pushes the trial timeline beyond April of 2020. 
My client’s position is also that we are entitled to any and all reports, memorandums, 
witness statements and investigative reports written, produced or possessed by the inspector 
general regarding this incident and the Federal Bureau of Prison’s policy regarding written 
statements and employee conduct. 
It should be noted, that it took the justice department, the FBI, the inspector general’s 
office and an assortment of other federal agencies more than 90 days to investigate this matter. 
Accordingly, it is more than reasonable that it would take the defendant and his counsel, who 
have less than one percent of the man power and resources of the government, a significantly 
longer time to accomplish an adequate investigation and review of all the necessary information 
provided in this case.

500 Pearl Street 
New York, New York 10007 
Re:  
United States v. Noel and Thomas, 
Cr. 830 (AT) 
Dear Judge Torres: 
The Government respectfully writes in response to the defendants’ letters of January 27, 
2020, requesting at least a six-month adjournment of the trial date in the above-captioned case, 
which is currently scheduled to commence on April 20, 2020.  The Government remains prepared 
to proceed to trial as scheduled.  As is set forth more fully below, while the Government has no 
objection to a brief adjournment of the trial date subject to the Court’s availability, the requested 
six-month adjournment is both unnecessary and unwarranted. 
By way of background, as is set forth in the Indictment, the charges in this case relate to a 
period of just over 14 hours—from approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to approximately 
6:30 a.m. the following day, August 10, 2019.  The Government has made three discovery 
productions—(1) the main production on December 31, 2019; (2) a small supplemental production 
on January 23, 2020; and (3) a reproduction of video surveillance footage with timestamps on 
January 24, 2020.1  While the December 31, 2019 discovery production consisted of a large 
number of pages of materials, many of those materials were produced principally in anticipation 
of defense requests and to help facilitate the very sort of broader investigation the defendants now 
claim they need to undertake.  For example, the Government produced MCC video surveillance 
for a period of longer than one month (July 5, 2019 to August 12, 2019); count slips for nearly 
three weeks (July 23, 2019 to August 14, 2019); thirty-minute round reports for more than a month 
(July 1, 2019 to August 10, 2019); and materials relating to the events of July 23, 2019.  Similarly, 
with respect to defendant Noel, the Government provided in discovery to her only a report from 
her cellphone, which consists of more than 20,000 pages, very few of which, if any, are relevant 
to the pending charges.  For substantially the same reasons, and as the Court is aware, the 
For the third production, the Government requested additional hard drives from defense counsel.  
To date, only Noel’s counsel provided a hard drive to the Government, which the Government 
then loaded and returned to counsel.  The Government stands ready to do the same for Thomas as 
soon as a hard drive is provided.

Government also produced 3500 material for every individual interviewed during the investigation 
in December, nearly four months in advance of trial. 
“Whether or not to adjourn a trial date is traditionally within the discretion of the trial 
judge.”  United States v. Scopo, 861 F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations omitted).  
While there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,” 
United States v. Al Fawaaz, 116 F. Supp. 3d 194, 210 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), the Second Circuit has 
identified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (1) the requested 
delay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with 
particularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not 
been dilatory.  Id. at 211 (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d 
814, 814-16 (2d Cir. 1963)). 
None of the circumstances identified in Al Fawaaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment 
requested by the defendants.  The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour 
window for which the evidence is limited and now available to the defendants.  Moreover, even as 
expanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in 
the instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no 
specific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment. 
Nor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an 
adjournment.  Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the 
indictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file 
pending his review of the discovery.  Noel’s counsel, however, identifies no reason to believe such 
a review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is 
aware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the 
defendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into 
evidence.  As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress.  As for the motion 
to dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no 
reason why such a motion could not be made in short order. 
Finally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government 
has already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on 
December 31, 2019, nearly four months before trial.  As the Court is well-aware, such productions 
of witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin.  As such, 
the Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional 
time to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—
cannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.

Accordingly, as noted above, the Government is prepared to proceed to trial as scheduled.  
That said, while the Government would not object to a short adjournment of the trial date to provide 
the defendants with additional time to prepare, the issues identified in the defendants’ letters do 
not require a six-month adjournment.

(Case called)
THE COURT:  Good morning.  We are here in the matter
of the United States v. Tova Noel and Michael Thomas.  
Would you make your appearance, please. 
MS. LONERGAN:  For the government, Jessica Lonergan.
With me at counsel table are my colleagues Nicholas Roos and
Rebekah Donaleski.  Good morning, your Honor.
MR. FOY:  May it please the court, your Honor, Jason
Foy, for Ms. Tova Noel, standing to my right.  Also with me at
counsel table is associate counsel Eric Sagara.  Good morning,
your Honor.
MR. SAGARA:  Good morning, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  Good morning your Honor.  Montell
Figgins on behalf of Michael Thomas, representing my client,
who stands to my right.
THE COURT:  I understand that the defense is
requesting that I adjourn the trial because of the volume of
discovery.  I will hear you on that.
MR. FOY:  Yes, your Honor.  We are asking that the
trial date of April 20, 2020, be moved to sometime in October
or a date thereafter that's convenient to the court.  The
reason for the request is because it is necessary in order to
provide an adequate and effective assistance of counsel.  Why?
Yes, because of the voluminous discovery.  But also because of
the amount of time it is going to take for us to conduct our
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 26     Filed 02/10/20     Page 2 of 15

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
own investigation, which can't really fully get started until
we appreciate what information has already been provided.
That's really the crux of the reason.
Now, I noted in the government's opposition, although
they agree that some adjournment is warranted, I guess the
issue is of how long the adjournment should be.  The defense is
in the best position to assess how much time we need to perform
our important function on behalf of our clients.  I say that
because we are not making a request for the purpose of simply
delaying the proceedings.  We are doing it because it is
actually necessary to accomplish our goals as counsel.
Also, which I did not reference in my letter, is it 
also takes into account my trial schedule, at least why my 
request was.  Last week, I was scheduled to start a trial 
before Judge Ramos in 40 Foley Square in July.  And part of 
what I discussed with Judge Ramos in setting that trial date 
was that I knew that this trial may need to be accommodated in 
some way.  He selected July 20 for that date mostly because of 
the court's availability at that time.  That's also part of the 
reason.  And in that particular case, my client's been 
incarcerated for almost two years.  He is facing a mandatory 
life sentence.  So I do need to spend some of my time getting 
ready for that as well, and I expect that to be our trial date. 
THE COURT:  What's the date?
MR. FOY:  What's the date?
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 26     Filed 02/10/20     Page 3 of 15

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
THE COURT:  In July.
MR. FOY:  July 20 for that trial.
So really it's so we can perform our functions, and of 
course there are other things going on as far as 
responsibilities, and that would give us sufficient time to be 
ready.  It is not an unreasonable request.  To say a case that 
started on November 19, 2019, to be tried in less than a year I 
don't think is an unusual circumstance.  I don't think anyone 
can say it is delayed justice.  My client, who is free, she is 
not incarcerated, so we don't have any of the interests of an 
incarcerated defendant who wants to get a speedy trial.  It is 
necessary, not an option, not just something we just feel like.  
This isn't about us laying back, taking our time.  It's about 
doing a diligent job.  In order to do that, we do need the 
time, and I would ask that you grant the request. 
THE COURT:  How long is the Judge Ramos trial?
MR. FOY:  The government represented that they expect
it to be about two weeks.
THE COURT:  Starting on July 20 you said, yes?
MR. FOY:  That's correct.
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor, I also join in the motion.
The court has had a chance to read my letter with respect to
requesting an adjournment.  It is very early for us at this
point even to have a full appreciation as to what's going to
happen in this matter.  I have only had the discovery for
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 26     Filed 02/10/20     Page 4 of 15

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
approximately two weeks.  It's going to take -- I think there
was at least 25 witness statements that we not only need to
review, but then we need to try and follow up and maybe contact
those witnesses.  There are some people who were incarcerated,
may have been released.  There are numerous things that must be
done in terms of at least us tracking down specific details
that our clients are demanding that we do in their defense.
It took the federal government 90 days to investigate 
this case and to come up with an indictment.  Accordingly, a 
law firm with one or two attorneys, without the resources of 
all the federal agencies, it is going to take us more than 90 
days to do the same amount of work.  So I don't think that it 
is an unreasonable request.   
Not to mention, I believe that if the court were not 
to grant some type of an adjournment, we are going to find 
ourselves back here again, but the defense will just be in a 
better position to give you more specifics as to why we need 
more time á la maybe we can't track down this witness or we 
spoke to this witness and now we have to find another one.  
There are numerous things like that that I think would come 
about, and that's why we would try and suggest to give the 
court a bird's eye view of that early on, so that maybe we can 
delay -- or avoid having to come back repeatedly just to make 
those additional requests. 
Additionally, your Honor, I do believe that there is a
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 26     Filed 02/10/20     Page 5 of 15

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
high likelihood that I'm going to file a motion to dismiss the
indictment based on selective prosecution.  I do believe that
if certain portions of that motion are granted, then that's
going to entitle the defense to additional discovery that we
haven't even received yet.
So with the request that we are asking for, we are 
also having an opportunity to kind of see -- I know kind of the 
things that are going to happen or potentially will happen, so 
instead of just trying to come back here three or four times to 
say this is happening, we can kind of just do this now and 
realize that that motion will probably be filed.  That may 
create other issues with respect to discovery. 
Also, your Honor, I have also made a specific request
under Rule 16 that the defense wants whatever investigation was
done and whatever information there is that is discoverable
with respect to the Inspector General's report.  It is my
position that we are entitled to that information.  It is an
investigation of the same incident.  It is an investigation of
the circumstances with which my client is being charged.  With
that being said, I do think that we are entitled to whatever
information was generated in those reports, so I believe that
also is going to cause a delay in the trial wherever we go with
that issue.
THE COURT:  We already addressed that the last time.
(Pause)

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
THE COURT:  I will hear from the government.
MS. LONERGAN:   Yes, your Honor.  As we put in our
written submission to the court, we agree that a brief
adjournment is appropriate, but we do not think that a
six-month adjournment is necessary or warranted.
First, the amount of discovery in this case is not 
particularly voluminous nor complex in light of the cases tried 
in this district; and, in addition, the further investigation, 
I want to focus the court on the facts that are going to be at 
issue in this trial occurred over a 14-hour period.  It is true 
that, as part of our discovery, we provided information outside 
of that 14-hour period, anticipating many of the types of 
requests that the defense counsel has already begun to make.  
But again, your Honor, this is a very focused, single-incident 
indictment that is about what happened over the period of 14 
hours.  A much larger investigation about, for example, the 
working conditions at the MCC, it is just not relevant to what 
is going to be the issues on trial here. 
I want to also touch on something that plaintiff said
about the need to interview witnesses.  As we explained to the
court, we have done something that's unusual here, which is
that we have provided witness statements with our initial
discovery almost four months in advance of trial.  As the court
is aware, we typically provide what we call 3500 material much
closer to trial.  So the need to review those witness
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 26     Filed 02/10/20     Page 7 of 15

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
statements and interview additional -- interview those
witnesses, that can't possibly weigh in favor of an adjournment
when in fact the defense counsel has so much more time with
those materials than they would in a typical trial schedule
where they might have those materials just a few weeks before
trial, your Honor.
So for those reasons, we think that we are hard
pressed to identify areas of additional investigation that
would touch on the 14-hour time period that is going to be at
issue in this trial; and so, for those reasons, while we agree
that a short adjournment is warranted, that six months is not
required.  We do understand of course that that may be
difficult with Mr. Foy's trial schedule with having the July
trial, but it seems like there may be a possibility of putting
this trial before Mr. Foy's July trial and still giving him
sufficient time to prepare for both.
THE COURT:  And how long do you expect this trial to
go?
MS. LONERGAN:  Your Honor, if this trial is confined
to that 14-hour time period, setting aside jury selection, I
can't imagine it lasting more than a week.
THE COURT:  Okay.  The trial is set for June 8.
With respect to the motion to dismiss, the motion is
due on March 9, opposition is due by April 6, and the reply is
due on April 20.

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
Are there any further applications?
MR. FIGGINS:  Yes, your Honor.  You said we dealt with
the issue with respect to the Investigator General's report.
This court has never addressed it at all.  You never said
anything with respect to that.  So I just want to make that
clear.  Do I need to file a motion with respect to that?
THE COURT:  You may file a formal motion.
MR. FIGGINS:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Anything further?
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor, can I have an additional two
weeks?  Can we push the motion schedule back at least an
additional two weeks?  Because I have my 80-something-year-old
relative coming to visit me from February 23 through March 1,
so I kind of won't be working during that time.  So if you
could just make it like -- if you could make it something
around like the 18th or the 21st.
THE COURT:  All right, then.  You can file your motion
by March 20.
How long does the prosecution need to oppose?
MS. LONERGAN:  Your Honor, three weeks, please.
THE COURT:  So the prosecution will file opposition on
April 10, and the reply will be April 24.
Is there anything further?
MS. LONERGAN:  Yes, your Honor, at this time the
government moves to exclude time between now and the trial

date, which has now been set for June 8, for the following
reasons:
It will allow the parties to discuss potential
pretrial dispositions, to allow defense counsel to review the
discovery, make and file motions, the court to resolve those
motions, and for the defense counsel to conduct the additional
discovery that they have been discussing today in court.
MR. FOY:  Your Honor, I don't oppose the government's
position.
I wanted to just go back to one thing.  I understand 
you have ruled.  I accept that it is June 8.  Hopefully there 
are no delays because I anticipate being out of the country -- 
we haven't set a specific date, but I'm traveling with family 
at the end of June.  So if there is any delay, that could be an 
issue. 
THE COURT:  You are talking about leisure travel?
MR. FOY:  Well, leisure.  My family, first-priority
travel.  That's what it is.  So I don't know if it's just
leisure.  It is not business, but it is the business of having
family business.
THE COURT:  Well, you should work your family schedule
around your professional obligations, counsel.
MR. FOY:  Well, if there is a delay in the
professional schedule of trial, because it is not unusual for
sometimes there to be delays, because if we start a week later
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 26     Filed 02/10/20     Page 10 of 15

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k1u2NoeC kjc
for some reason, then it's going to create a conflict.
THE COURT:  You will not be starting a week later.  We
are starting on the 8th of June.
MR. FOY:  Okay.  Here is the issue.  The government
has represented to you that this is just about a 14-hour
period.  I suspect that, when the trial comes around, that the
only thing that won't come up during the trial is the 14-hour
period, right?  Because it's not as if we are not here because
of other things having nothing to do with the defendants in
this case, and the working conditions at MCC are directly
related to why things happened in that 14-hour period.  The
years of conduct, the culture of the institution, the failures
in security measures beyond counts.
We have been provided with three videos of the 192 
that exist.  In the SHU there are nine video cameras.  Only one 
has been produced, and it shows almost nothing.  And why that 
is, the circumstances, what it means, is relevant.   
So maybe it will be a one-week trial.  That's 
possible.  But what I am trying to avoid is some type of 
conflict that we can see now that -- you know, because, you 
know, I understand professional obligations, but if I had to 
choose between family and my professional obligations, it's -- 
THE COURT:  All right.  Well, counsel, I am directing
that you be here on June 8 to start trial.
MR. FOY:  I will be here.

k1u2NoeC kjc
THE COURT:  That is my order.
MR. FOY:  And I will be here.  I just don't want there
to be any delay that creates that issue.
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor -- sorry to cut you off.
Your Honor, I'm thankful Mr. Foy said that about the 
family vacation.  I am actually going to be in Italy on a 
cruise June 1 through June 14.  We fly back on the 15th of 
June. 
THE COURT:  And you just forgot about it?
MR. FIGGINS:  Your Honor, I don't keep my social
calendar.  Luckily he said that and I realized that in June we
do have a cruise scheduled, and I didn't even know the date, so
I had to find out just now.
THE COURT:  When do you return?
MR. FIGGINS:  The 15th, and I don't even know what day
of the week that is, but . . .
THE COURT:  We will start on the 22nd of June.
MR. FOY:  Well, Judge, that's the time I was just

arrangements to travel with my family.  Right?
THE COURT:  Well, I understand that it is desirable to
have family time, but you also have an obligation to zealously
represent your client, and so we are going to start on the
22nd.
MR. FOY:  So I don't understand.  I mean, I have no

problem zealously representing my client, and I will do so.  If
my daughter is going to be in Italy, ironically, and my wife
and my other daughter are going to travel there at the end of
her program so we can spend time, how is that an issue for us
to take that into consideration in a professional setting?
Like, I don't understand.
THE COURT:  Counsel, you will use Skype.  Is there
anything --
MR. FOY:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

THE COURT:  Sit down, counsel.
MR. FOY:  Can I be heard?
THE COURT:  You will sit down.
MR. FOY:  And then be heard from the seat?
THE COURT:  No.  You will sit down.
Is there anything further unrelated to the vacation
plans --
MR. FOY:  This is not just vacation, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Counsel, I have had it.  Now, you sit down
and stop --

The time is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act for the reasons
already stated by the prosecution.

MOTION OF MICHAEL THOMAS TO COMPEL DISCOVERY 
INTRODUCTION 
Defendant, Michael Thomas, through his counsel, hereby moves for an order compelling 
the government to produce information in its possession or accessible to it from other agencies 
allied with the prosecution, concerning investigations and other materials relating to the facts 
alleged in the indictment, including but not limited to such documents that relate to the 
investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein, that is (a) material to the preparation under Fed. 
R. Crim. P. 16, and/or (b) exculpatory, inculpatory, or impeachment information discoverable 
under the Brady-Giglio doctrine. 
The information requested in this motion has been previously requested by the defense in 
a letter dated January 29, 2020 from the Office of the United States Attorney, Southern District 
of New York. (See Exhibit A.) Through counsel from said office, the request has been denied, 
with government prosecutors referring defense counsel to their in-court statements made on 
November 25, 2019. (See Exhibit B.) 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 6 of 38
A. 
BACKGROUND 
The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant, 
Noel. and Created False Records 
The government's investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged 
suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August 10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"). 
At that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers 
in the section of the MCC, known as the Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). 
The indictment (Indictment, Introduction at ,r 1 ), alleges, among other things1 that certain 
prison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by 
the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired 
to conceal the failure to conduct the prison counts, by creating and signing false records, 
attesting that such counts had occurred. (Id.) 
Thus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at ,r 
28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment, 
Count Four at ,r 15.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the 
indictment. 
B. 
Mr. Thomas' Rule 16 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production 
of Documents Have Been Denied 
On December 16, 2019, the parties agreed to a protective order as to discovery, and on 
that day this Court entered same (Docket # 13). On January 29, 2020, defendant, Thomas, made 
certain requests to the government under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March 14, 2020, the government 
responded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request. 
The substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government's responses 
made at the pretrial conference of November 25, .2019. (11/25/2019 - Docket Minute Entry). 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 7 of 38
This refusal is perplexing and nonsensical because these same government prosecutors presented 
the defendant with a consent to search document from the office of the Inspector General. (See 
Exhibit C.) 
This motion concerns the defense requests for production of documents regarding 
important and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with 
information that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. (See article attached as Exhibit D.) 
Additionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive 
investigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP"). The United States Attorney 
General, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons commissioner, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer 
both made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth 
investigation into the Bureau of Prisons' policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a 
direct result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August 10, 2019. (See Exhibit D.) This 
report is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is 
material and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant's assertion that staffing issues, 
staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go 
to the heart of his defense to the government's criminal allegations. 
The government's response to Mr. Thomas' discovery request was not detailed and 
simply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal 
justification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to 
the items originally requested by his counsel. 
C. 
The Inspector General's Report and Any Other Reports, Documents, 
and/or Memoranda Made by Other Federal Agencies Investigating the 
Incident Surrounding the Death of Jeffrey Epstein Are Discoverable and 
Must Be Produced 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 8 of 38
As stated previously, there is no dispute that multiple investigations by numerous federal 
agencies were opened to investigate the events surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein on 
August IO, 2019. Michael Thomas is charged with certain crimes resulting from this same event. 
On August 10, 2019, the Washington Examiner, reported under the headline: "Barr announces 
DOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death." (See Exhibit D.) On December 28, 
2019, Renters reported under the headline: "FBI investigating Jeffrey Epstein's inner circle."1 On 
September 11, 2019, CNN reported under the headline: "The Jeffrey Epstein investigation was 
more expansive than previously thought, documents show."2 This news clip refers to what 
appears to be a separate investigation by the U.S. Marshals Service. On the Wikipedia page 
entitled, "Death of Jeffrey Epstein," the following appears, among other information: "After 
initially expressing suspicion, Attorney General William Barr described Epstein's death as 'a 
perfect storm of screw-ups.' Both the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice's Inspector General 
are conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death. 3" 
D. 
The Information Sought by This Motion. 
In the minute entry on the docket, of November 25, 2019, this Court noted, among other 
things, "The Government shall produce discovery to the defense by December 31, 2019." This 
discovery was not produced. Because the government has failed to meet the disclosure mandates 
of Rule 16 and Brady-Giglio, this motion seeks to compel the government to produce the 
following: 1) Inspector General's report investigating the death ofJeffrey Epstein and the Bureau 
of Prisons' policies and procedures; 2) any reports, witness statements, memorandum, and 
documents from any separate investigation conducted by the BOP; and 3) any reports, witness 
statements and/or documents created by any other federal agencies that investigated the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein that have not already been disclosed.

. 
The report of the Inspector General, as to both defendants, including, any 
and all supporting memorandums, written statements, photos, videos, and 
incident reports 
The defendant is entitled to complete disclosure of the Inspector General's report. 
Moreover, Mr. Thomas has a right to any and all information obtained in this investigation. Not 
only is it possible that this report contains additional witness statements but this report also has 
information that has not been furnished by the government in any capacity previously. Moreover, 
while the government would like to limit its discovery obligation to reports, videos and 
documents related specifically to night and early morning hours of August 10, 2019, the defense 
submits that there is a much larger context that lead to those events and the charges against 
Michael Thomas. Indeed, the Attorney General of the United States and the "acting" 
commissioner of the BOP opened an investigation that was precipitated by the events of August 
10, 2019 but said investigation was much more expansive and in-depth. In November 2019, the 
"acting" commissioner Kathleen Hawks Sawyer stated at a congressional hearing under oath that 
there were more than 3300 vacancies within the BOP and she was surprised that the BOP was 
able to function with such issues. She went on to state that: "The vast majority of staff are good, 
hardworking employees, "but they are tired because they are stretched." (See article attached as 
Exhibit E.) The broad depth of the Inspector General's report presumably was that there were a 
myriad of systematic issues affecting the BOP that allowed the events of August 10, 2019 and 
the death of Jeffrey Epstein to occur. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to disclosure of any 
and all of this information, especially if it relates to his defense of the charges that have been 
initiated. It is the defendant's contention that this report may also contain Brady-Giglio material. 
Indeed, the prosecutors in this case may be denying the defendant his right to this material 
without any knowledge of its contents. If so, this is a dereliction of their duty and denies Mr. 
Thomas important rights that are the foundation of our judicial system. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 10 of 38
2. 
Any and all internal investigative reports created by the BOP as to both 
defendants, including, any and all supporting memorandums, written 
statements, photos, videos, and mcident reports 
To date, the government has disclosed a multitude of discovery documents but those 
documents only relate to witness statements, video and incident reports concerning the events of 
August 10, 2019. Michael Thomas would like this court to authorize the disclosure of any and all 
reports generated by investigators within the Bureau of Prisons regarding the August JO, 2019 
incident, if those have not been disclosed. Additionally, the defendant seeks any all documents, 
reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have 
engaged in the same or similar conduct. Mr. Thomas requests the results of any disciplinary 
proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding the discipline or administrative 
adjudication of any other employees who have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts. More 
specifically, the defense is aware that there was an almost identical incident in 2005 or 2006 
wherein officers failed to conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate committed 
suicide. The defense believes that only one of four officers in that case was given only a minor 
(14) day suspension. Moreover, although the government will argue that this incident is far 
removed from thi, current incident, the defendant disagrees. Mr. Thomas knew some of the 
individuals in that incident and he was well aware that their conduct did not lead to their 
indictment or incarceration. In fact, many of those officers did not receive as much as a 
reprimand for falsifying the same documents that Mr. Thomas is now charged with a federal 
crime for submitting. This goes to Mr. Thomas' defense in this case. The defendant's state of 
mind is always a material and relevant fact in any criminal case. Indeed, the mens rea for U.S. 
Code § I 001 is that the party knowingly and willfully made the false statement. Undoubtedly, 
given the assertions already made this information is of significant importance to Mr. Thomas' 
defense. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 11 of 38
3. 
As to both defendants, any and all reports, memorandums, written 
statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or 
possessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies, participating in 
the investigation of the defendants, allied with the prosecution, and to 
which the prosecution has access 
Defendant, Thomas, believes that the information contained in all of the requested 
documents may contain infonnation that tends to exculpate him. He believes, in addition, that 
there may be other witnesses, or witness statements that are relevant, and which are not in the 
possession of the FBI investigators, who submitted reports in this case. Such reports will contain 
detailed infonnation and statistics that show the conduct in which the defendant is being charged 
with a crime were: 1) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with knowledge and acquiescence 
by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies that forced the defendant to 
engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally, and; 4) made in a manner 
which contains a ·possible discriminatory application of BOP policies by govenunent 
prosecutors. 
The information requested by this motion is not the only infonnation that Mr. Thomas 
seeks under Rule 16 and Brady-Giglio. Further discovery motions will be necessary, once 
counsel has had the opportunity to review any response made by the govenunent, in compliance 
with any order entered by this Court on this motion. The present motion is filed at this time 
because the government has refused the defendant's request to engage. in a fair and impartial 
disclosure of relevant discovery. Early resolution of this dispute will enable defense counsel to 
determine the necessity and scope of pretrial subpoenas duces tecum.

A. 
ARGUMENT 
The Complete Inspector General's Report, as WeJI as the Other Reports 
Requested Are Necessary for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense 
l\1r. Thomas' requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated 
by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(l)E, provides: 
"(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant's request, the 
government must pennit the defendant to inspect and to copy or 
photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible 
objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these 
items, if the item is within the government's possession, custody, 
or control and: 
(i) the item is material to preparing the defense; 
(ii) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-
chief at trial; or 
(iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the 
defendant." 
Rule 16(a)(l)(E)(i) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing 
arguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief See United States v. Armstrong, 517 
U.S. 456, 462 (1996). The key term for present purposes is "material." A document is material if: 
[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a 
defense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to 
be deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because 
the govenm1ent may be able to use it to rebut a defense position .... 
Nor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have 
dissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached 
testimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 (S.D. N.Y. 2003) 
The federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn "material" means 
when it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule 16. Evidence is material if its pretrial 
disclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See 
United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.1991) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F. 
Supp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2004) Numerous federal districts have repeatedly ruled that "evidence 
is material under Rule 16 as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 13 of 38
in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation, corroborating testimony, or 
assisting impeachment or rebuttal." United States v . . Marshall, 132 F.3d 63, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1998) 
(quoting United States v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). Courts have interpreted the scope of Rule 16 (a)(l)(E)(i) broadly to ensure that 
defendants such as Mr. Thomas have a fair opportunity to prepare for trial. United States v. 
Poindexter, 727 F. Supp. 1470, 1473 (D.D.C. 1989) ("The language and the spirit of the Rule are 
designed to provide to a criminal defendant, in the interest of fairness, the widest possible 
opportunity to inspect and receive such materials in the possession of the government as may aid 
him in presenting his side of the case.") Accordingly, the "materiality standard nonnally is not a 
heavy burden." United States v. Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 350, 356 (S.D.N.Y.2007) (quoting United 
States v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348,351 (D.C.Cir.1993)). Lloyd, 992 F.2d at 351 (internal citation and 
quotation marks omitted); United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 11, 13 (D.D.C. 1991) (the 
materiality hurdle "is not a high one"). The requested documents in this motion are essential to 
Mr. Thomas' ability to prepare a defense. Mr. Thomas contends that the conduct with which he 
is being charged is: 1) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with knowledge and acquiescence 
by the leadership of the BOP; and 3) is the direct result of BOP policies and mismanagement that 
forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally. 
Moreover, the information sought in this motion is crucial to the preparation of Mr. Thomas' 
defense. For instance, Mr. Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the 
MCC in August of 20 I 9 led to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is now criminally charged. If 
the Court accepts this representation, then the Court should find that the discovery requests 
contained in this motion are "material" and must be disclosed. As support for this position the 
defendant has attached an excerpt from a union conunittee meeting that was held merely 3 days 
before Jeffrey Epstein died at MCC on August 10, 2019. The attached memorandum 
memorializes a meeting attended by Jermaine Darden, the captain of the MCC, wherein he was 
V 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 14 of 38
informed that there were severe staffing shortages in the SHU where the alleged crime took place 
and that these staffing shortages created a significant safety risk. (See excerpt attached as Exhibit 
F.) 
Additionally, Michael Thomas is charged with making false statements for signing 
certain count slips and round sheets. However, what the government has deliberately failed to 
clarify is that those documents have to be approved by supervisors and are signed and/or initialed 
by other BOP employees. If this is the case, why is Michael Thomas and Tova Noel the only two 
employees charged with making false statements. Indeed, according to the government, they 
have video showing Mr. Thomas sleeping and surfing the internet instead of doing the rounds as 
required. Importantly, on the night in question, there is at least one BOP employee tasked with 
watching the surveillance cameras. Presumably, _this person would have watched Mr. Thomas sit 
in his chair and sleep and then observe him present a document stating that he conducted rounds. 
It is -defendants' burden to make a prima facie showing that documents sought under Rule 
16(a)(l)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. at 894. "To 
establish a showing of materiality, a defendant must offer more than the conclusory allegation 
that the requested evidence is material." See United States v. Ashley, 905 F. Supp. 1146, 1168 
(E.D,N.Y.1995) The defendant submits that he has.carried this burden. Plainly, the documents 
upon which the govenunent procured an indictment based on making a false statement have to 
be reviewed, verified and signed by other BOP employees and/or supervisory personnel. 
However, inexplicably none of those individuals are charged with violating the law. This issue 
standing alone establishes the import of how the requested disclosures will assist "the defendant 
significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor." United States v. Maniktala, 934 F.2d 25, 
(2d Cir.1991) The requested reports go to the heart of Mr. Thomas' defense. He needs to 
know if these issues are addressed in the Inspector General's report or in any other reports by 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 15 of 38
government agencies because it is highly relevant to Mr. Thomas' defense in this case. 
Furthermore, the govermnent had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the 
Inspector General's office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government turned over the results of 
this search in the normal conrse of discovery production. This fact shows that the Inspector 
General was investigating this incident thus all infonnation they receive is discoverable. This 
Court should order the production of the documents within forty-five (45) days from the entry of 
an order on this motion. 
B. 
Rule 16 and Brady-Giglio Include the Production of Documents and 
Reports Generated by Other Agencies 
The facts, shown above as reported in the media and secondary sources, clearly show that 
other agencies were involved in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein's death and the defendant's 
arrest and indictment. Thus, clearly, this Court should not pernrit the government to self.. limit 
discovery. A prosecutor is not "allowed to avoid disclosure of evidence by the simple expedient 
ofleaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another agency while utilizing his access to 
it in preparing his case for trial." United States v. Trevino, 556 F.2d 1265, 1272 (5th Cir.1977); 
U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2004) 
In United States v. B,yan, 868 F.2d 1032 (9th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 858, 110 
S.Ct. 167, 107 L.Ed.2d 124 (1989), after a nationwide investigation by the IRS, Bryan had been 
convicted of; among other things, conspiracy to defraud the United States. Bryan sought 
discovery, under Rule 16(a)(!)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges 
against Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further 
objection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the 
matter was pending, Oregon, fanned the basis of the government's objection. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 16 of 38
Bryan argued, conversely, that the 'government' under the Rule, included not only the 
prosecutors, but also any closely connected investigative agencies. The Court dispensed with the 
'out of District' argument by the government, ruling that Rule 16 was not so limiting. 
With respect to the issue of production of items from other closely connected agencies, 
the Court found in favor of Bryan as far as discovery of items by such agencies. In setting forth 
the rule, the Court said: "The prosecutor will be deemed to have knowledge of and access to 
anything in the possession, custody and control of any federal agency participating in the same 
investigation of the defendant." Id.at 1036. 
The District Courts of New York have followed B,J,an, supra. In United States of 
America v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 204 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), also a corrections/police officer case, 
the Court found that the materials were discoverable from any other agencies "allied with the 
prosecution." Id. at 221. In addition, in citing to B1yan, supra, the Court stated that: "Another 
factor in the analysis is whether or not the prosecution has access to the materials." Id. 
In this matter, defendant, Thomas, has shown that other agencies 'allied with the 
prosecution,' have and/or are, participating with each other. The statement of Attorney General, 
William Barr, confirms that a separate investigation was initiated by the Inspector General. 
Additionally, it seems more than obvious that the internal affairs division within the BOP 
conducted a separate investigation into the events in questions. Importantly, Rule 16 focuses on 
the preparation of the defense. Therefore, documents are material under Rule 16 and subject to 
disclosure if they help the defense to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the government's 
case. Marshall, 132 F.3d at 67-68. 
Other Districts have also followed B,yan. In United States v. Libby, 432 F. Supp. 81 
(D.D.C. 2006), the Court was faced with a motion to compel, by defendant, I. 'Scooter' Libby, in 
the Valerie Plame CIA leak case. The matter concerning Libby concerned whether he lied as to 
the disclosures as to Plame. Libby sought documents which, as the Court pointed out, were of a 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 17 of 38
far-reaching nature, including documents related to a revenge issue as to Valerie Plame, and her 
late husband, Ambassador Wilson. Tue Court in Libby ruled in favor for the defense and granted 
the motion to compel discovery in several key areas of the case. 
This Court will find Libby, supra, important because the Court's decision in that case 
focused on "all agencies" that have information regarding the offenses charged. In the instant 
matter, therefore, it will not be enough for the government to state that other agencies may not be 
allied with the prosecution, or that the government lacks access to the documents. If the 
documents provide exculpatory evidence, and are related to the issues in the indictment, they 
must be produced. 
In Marshall, 132 F.3d at 63, the defendant was charged in a drug related transaction. 
There were records on visitation from the local jail where the defendant was incarcerated, pager 
records, the pager, and local records from the county public records about a traffic stop. These 
items were uncovered by the government agents investigating the matter, but only after 
discovery had been concluded. During the course of the trial, the Court took a four-day 
adjournment, in order to address the newly discovered evidence. The trial judge decided to 
exclude all of the newly discovered evidence, and, as a result, Marshall was found guilty. On 
appeal, the government argued that, in fact, the newly discovered evidence, under Rule 16, 
tended to incriminate, not exculpate Marshall. On appeal, the Court disagreed, citing Rule 
16(a)(l)(C) as requiring the production of items that are material to the preparation of the 
defendant's case. The Court, in addition, rejected the government's argument, that the items 
must be 'materially exculpatory,' Id. at 68. In announcing the rule, that Court stated: "In United 
States v. Lloyd, we said that evidence is material under Rule 16 'as Jong as there is a strong 
indication that it will play an important role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness 
preparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting impeachment or rebuttal."' See Lloyd at 351. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 18 of 38
Undoubtedly, the government is going to assert that the requested documents in this 
motion are not relevant or material and do not bear on the charges as they relate to the conduct 
that did or did not take place on August 10, 2019. The documents sought are material if they will 
help the defense with trial preparation tasks such as evaluating the strength of the government's 
case, investigating possible defenses, finding additional relevant evidence, and developing 
strategies to impeach government witnesses. See United States v. Safavian, 233 F.R.D. 12 
(D.D.C. 2005) It is not up to the government to define Mr. Thomas' defenses to the indictment or 
to determine what is useful in preparing them. 
For these reasons, this Court should include the requirement of the production of both 
inculpatory and exculpatory evidence in any order granting this motion to compel. 
At this juncture, however, the government has made, at best, a token objection to the 
discovery by citing to a terse denial made at a previous court appearance. 
Mr. Thomas, therefore, cannot guess what may be other objections, but this Court should 
overrule any such attestations as going against fundamental fairness. 
C. 
The Reports and Documents Requested Are Discoverable Under Bradv 
This motion has articulated several rationales upon which the defendant in this matter is 
entitled to much more infonnation than the government is voluntarily willing to disclose. The 
government's disclosure obligations do not end with Rule 16. Much of the discovery sought by 
this motion is firmly rooted within the scriptures of d_ocuments that must be disclosed under the 
doctrine set forth 'mBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. 
Under Brady, the govermnent has an affirmative duty to produce any evidence favorable 
to the defendant that is material to either guilt or punishment. See United States v. Bagley, 473 
U.S. 667, 674-75 (1985) (the prosecution is required "to disclose evidence favorable to the 
accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial"). Both exculpatory 
infonnation and evidence that can be used to impeach the prosecution's witnesses are considered 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 19 of 38
"favorable" under Brady and must be disclosed by the government. Id. at 676-77; see also Giglio 
v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55 (1972); In re Sealed Case No. 99-3096 (Brady 
Obligations), 185 F.3d 887,892 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Moreover, the defense is already in possession 
of witness statements that one or both of the defendants in this indictment may have conducted 
rounds or inmate counts on August JO, 2019. Accordingly, there is a logical assumption that 
there might be additional exculpatory statements contained in the Inspector General's report or 
certain internal reports maintained by the BOP internal affairs division or other government 
agencies that were conducting a contemporaneous investigation with FBI. 
The prosecution must produce to the defense not only all favorable evidence that is 
admissible, but also all evidence "that is likely to lead to favorable evidence that would be 
admissible." Sa/avian, 233 at 17 (quoting United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 2d 1196, 1198-
(C.D.Cal. 1999)). Just as with Rule 16 disclosure, the govennnent must interpret its Brady 
obligations broadly. "Where doubt exists as to the usefulness of the evidence to the defendant, 
the government must resolve all such doubts in favor of full disclosure." Id. (citing United States 
v. Paxson, 861 F.2d 730, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Without question, the Brady disclosure 
obligation is broader than Rule 16 because it requires production not just of documents, but also 
of information known to the government that has been documented in some fashion. 
In Sa/avian, the court explained the materiality standard w1der Brady that applies to 
pretrial discovery: 
[T]he government must always produce any potentially 
exculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to how 
the withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the 
benefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial. The 
question before trial is not whether the govennnent thinks that 
disclosure of the information or evidence it is considering 
withholding might change the outcome of the trial going forward, 
but whether the evidence is favorable and therefore must be 
disclosed. 

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 33     Filed 04/09/20     Page 20 of 38
Id. at 16 (citing cases); see also United States v. Edwards, 191 F. Supp. 2d. 88, 90 (D.D.C. 
2002). 
The defendant avers that much of the requested reports fall well into the conscripts of 
Brady and thus should be disclosed in pretrial discovery.

Barr announce.5 DOJ inspector general Investigation into Epstein death 
Barr announces DOJ inspector general 
investigation into Epstein death 
by Jerry Dunleav1 ! August 10, 2019 01:16 PM 
Attorney General William Barr announced following Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide 
Saturday morning that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz launched an 
investigation into the circumstances of the accused child sex trafficker's death in his prison 
cell. 
This move is in addition to the FBI inquiry already underway. The FBI declined to comment 
about its investigation. 
"I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an 
apparent suicide while in federal custody," Barr said. "Mr. Epstein's death raises serious 
questions that must be answered." 
Neither the Justice Department not the inspector general's office immediately responded to 
the Washington Examiner's request for further details. 
The Bureau of Prisons released a statement on Saturday stating that the jet-setting financier 
and sex offender was found "unresponsive in his cell" located in the Special Housing Unit at 
around 6:30 a.m. this morning following "an apparent suicide." Officials said lifesaving efforts 
were immediately undertaken and that emergency medical services were quickly called. 
Epstein was brought to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
Epstein reportedly hanged himself, and a gurney carrying Epstein's body was wheeled out of 
the Manhattan Correctional Center around 7:30 a.m. this morning, according to reports. 
According to a representative for NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner who spoke with the 
Washington Examiner, "there is no official cause of death yet" as "the medical examiner has to 
do their job." 
"We are investigating the cause of death and we have an open case," the representative said. 
The 14-page indictment against Epstein alleged that he sexually exploited dozens of minor 
girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, among other locations, between 
2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Some of the victims were ostensibly as young as 14 at the 
time the alleged crimes occurred. Epstein allegedly "created a vast network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit"and "maintained a steady supply of new victims."

Barr announces DOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death 
Epstein was reportedly found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck back 
in July, but it had never been officially confirmed by authorities whether he had attempted to 
take his own life, whether he'd been assaulted by another inmate, or whether it was a ploy to 
change prisons. 
Epstein was subsequently placed on suicide watch, but there are numerous reports that when 
he was found dead Saturday he "was in his cell but was not on suicide watch at the time of his 
death." 
• The Manhattan Correctional Center. did not immediately respond to questions from the 
Washington Examiner about the circumstances of Epstein's suicide and how it was allowed to 
happen. 
Horowitz has handled high-profile investigations before. Last summer, the watchdog released 
a 568-page report on Midyear Exam, the DOJ and FBI investigation into former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton's improper private email server. And the inspector general is expected to 
release the results of his investigation into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act during the Trump-Russia probe sometime around Labor Day. 
Epstein's apparent suicide followed the unsealing on Friday of 2,000 pages of court records by 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit connected to the defamation lawsuit brought by 
Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's on-again-
off-again girlfriend and longtime associate whom Giuffre has accused of helping Epstein 
abuse her and other women when Giuffre was underage. The records included allegations by 
Giuffre that Maxwell instructed her to have sex with the U.K.'s Prince Andrew, New Mexico Gov. 
Bill Richardson, and former Sen. George Mitchell as well as money manager Glenn Dubin and 
MIT professor Marvin Minksy, among other high-profile figures. 
Before Friday, Epstein's flight records spanning from 1999 through 2005 had been made 
public, but new flight manifests ranging from November 1995 through August 2013 were 
released Friday. The records show Epstein crisscrossed the globe accompanied by tycoons, 
celebrities, employees, friends, and politicos. 
Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney for Southern Florida, reached an agreement in 2008 with 
Epstein's attorneys in which Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution 
solicitation charges. Epstein served just 13 months of an 18-month stint at a Palm Beach 
County jail where he was allowed out on work release, paid restitution to certain victims, and 
registered as a sex offender. The agreement was reportedly struck before investigators had 
finished interviewing all the alleged victims and was kept secret from some of Epstein's 
victims. Acosta left his Cabinet position amid increased scrutiny of the sweetheart deal.

Barr announces OOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death 
Florida Governor Ron Desantis announced earlier this week that the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement was launching an investigation into the Pa Im Beach County Sheriffs Office 
to look at every aspect of Epstein's case in Florida. The Justice Department said in February 
that it had also launched an internal inquiry into the handling of the Epstein case at the 
federal level, but the status of that investigation is not known. 
Epstein was arrested at the airport in Teterboro, New Jersey after returning from an overseas 
trip to Paris in early July. Epstein's home in New York City was raided by law enforcement as 
well, and investigators found nude photographs of underage girls, thousands of dollars in 
cash, dozens of loose diamonds, and a foreign passport from the 1980s with Epstein's picture 
and a false name. 
Epstein's lawyers had argued that Epstein should be allowed out on house arrest, asking the 
court to let him await trial in his Manhattan mansion. That request was denied. Besides his 
New York City mansion, Epstein also had an estate in Palm Beach, maintained a ranch in New 
Mexico, had a luxury apartment in Paris, and owned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
In denying him bail earlier this month, the judge said 
that Epstein posed a "significant" danger to the 
community and agreed with prosecutors that he was 
a serious flight risk.

Lack of Staff and Resources Continue to Strain the Federal Bureall of Prisons. Ovarslght. Government Executive 
Lack of Staff and Resources Continue to Strain the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons 
By Courtney BublE! 
November 19, 2019 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons is severely lacldng in staff and resources, the director testified before a Senate panel on Tuesday. 
Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, who was bureau director from 1992-2003, came out of retirement to lead the agency again after acting dil't'.-!<!I nc Hugh Hurwjl?. WM 
reassigned in the aftermath of financier and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's death in August v,rhile in federal custody. As the bureau, which aYersees 
122 federal prisons and more than 170,000 inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Ster.2d.t's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances 
that led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer. 
"\l.,Te have put such huge strains on the Bureau of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission," Hawk Ss:wyer said before the Senate Judiciary ('.ommitlee. "\Vith 
the dramatic growth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages1 it's just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last 16 
years that I've been gone." The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, "but they are tired because they are stretched," she added. 
Hawk Sawyer attributed the resource problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 30 ~•ears1 employees retiring at a faster rate than they 
are hired, uncertain budgets1 the recent government shutdown and the hiring freeze early in the Trump administration. "\<\1e have never had adequate 
resources to provide all the programs for all the inmates," Hawk Sawyer said. "I'm hoping that will change now since you all support the First Step Act." 
According to the bure.E1n's wehsite it currently has 36,348 staff membeis. The New York Times .mR,'lrled: 
Bet-ween December 2016 and September 2018 - the date of the most recent data aYailable from the federal Office of Personnel Management - the number of 
correctional officers fell more than 11%, from 19,082 to 16,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend Before President Donald Trump took office, the 
number of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were 12.5% more officers at the end of 2016 compared to the beginning of 2012. 
Hawk Sawyer said the bureau has "made great progress" to fill the over 3,300 vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff, 
the bureau is working \\ith the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already 
trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online. 
Sawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She a-pects the agency will receive 
$75 million in this year's appropriations for the First Step Act1 ,vhich the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more. Last year the

momw to fund the program had to come out of the agency's own budget since it didn't get any extra from Congress, according to Hawk Sawyer. 
In the meantime, the bureau has been relying on augmentation to temporariJy fill correctional officer positions with other staff. Although Sawyer said this is a 
good process and all staff are trained fort his role, she admitted tbe agency has to use augmentation more than is optimal and often employees are taken away 
from their designated work. 
In addition to hiring, Hawk Sawyer said the bureau is working to replace the surveillance cameras in a11 prisons, ensure that staff are thoroughly trained and 
have managers repeatedly tell staff what their responsibilities are. These are all issues that came to light in the wake of the Epstein scanda1. 
As the hearing was going on the .Justice Deoortment indicted the two federal correctional officers on duty the night of Epstein's death with falsifying records 
to say they checked on him. 
Ha\-',:k Sawyer agreed with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that the Epstein situation was a "black eye .. on the entire agency. Since the FBI and the Justice Department 
Inspector General are loo ling into the Epstein case she said she could not speak about any specifics. 
"\Ve have some bad staff," Hawk Sawyer said. .. ,,ve want rid of those bad staff who don't do their job. We want them gone one way or another either by 
prosecution or by termination. But the good staff are doing atraordinaty work out there every day managing the 177,000 inmates. You never hear anything 
about those people."

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
-against- 
Cr. 830 (AT) 
ORDER 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, 
                                                  Defendants.   
ANALISA TORRES, District Judge: 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated substantial changes in the Court’s 
trial schedule in order to ensure that jury trials can be conducted safely and practically.  
Moreover, on April 20, 2020, the Honorable Colleen McMahon, Chief Judge, ordered that “the 
conduct of jury trials in this district be and hereby is suspended until further order of the court.”  
In re: Coronavirus/COVID-19 Pandemic (Suspension of Jury Trials as a Result of Covid-19 and 
the Limitation of Court Operations), 20 Misc. 197, ECF No. 1 at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020).  
The Chief Judge further ordered that time be excluded for all criminal trials under the Speedy 
Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from April 27, 2020 to June 15, 2020, noting that “[t]he 
[c]ourt may further extend the period of exclusion as circumstances may warrant.”  In re: 
Coronavirus/COVID-19 Pandemic (Extension of Time Under the Speedy Trial Act), 20 Misc. 
196, ECF No. 1 ¶ 6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020).  Accordingly, the trial in this action scheduled to 
commence on June 22, 2020, is ADJOURNED to January 4, 2021.   
It is ORDERED that the time between June 22, 2020 and January 4, 2021 is excluded 
under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice.  The Court 
finds that the ends of justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the 
public and Defendants in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently 
administer the Court’s docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties 
to prepare for trial and to discuss potential pretrial disposition. 
It is further ORDERED that the parties shall appear for a status conference on 
September 9, 2020, at 1:00 p.m., in Courtroom 15D of the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition to defendant 
Michael Thomas’s motion to compel discovery.  (Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”).  Thomas seeks an order 
compelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable 
under any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense.  Thomas’s motion is 
entirely without merit and should be denied.1  
Thomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of discovery directly 
relevant to the charges against him.  (Mot. 6).  Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the 
Government to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his 
purported defenses, namely, that he committed the offenses because of staffing issues and 
supervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution.  Specifically, Thomas seeks: (i) a 
copy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General 
(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary 
materials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2019 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (ii) reports 
and documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and 
are not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (iii) reports and documents related to “any 
and all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same 
or similar conduct,” including an incident in “2005 or 2006” where officers failed to conduct 
counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and 
documents related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP 
Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial 
motions.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(3) (“If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 
12(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely.  But a court may consider the defense, objection, or 
request if the party shows good cause.”).  
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 6 of 34

policies which relate to the “much larger context” at the BOP (Mot. 6, 7, 9, 10).   
As an initial matter, the Government has satisfied its Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio obligations 
and is not in possession of the additional materials that Thomas seeks.  More importantly, Thomas 
is not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate 
reasons.  First, the records are not “material” to preparing a defense because they are wholly 
irrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to 
nullify the charges against him.  Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the “possession” 
of the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect 
materials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were 
not part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas.  Third, there is no 
legal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-
OIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege.  Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to 
discovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they “falsif[ied] the same 
documents,” (Mot. 6), because he has utterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to 
prosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  
Thomas’s motion should be denied in all respects.   
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
I. 
The Indictment  
Indictment 19 Cr. 830 (AT) (the “Indictment”) was filed on November 19, 2019, charging 
defendants Tova Noel and Michael Thomas in six counts: (i) conspiring to defraud the United 
States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Section 371 (Count One); and (ii) five counts of making or using a false writing or document, in 
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 3 (Counts Two through Six).  
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 7 of 34

Both defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged 
in Counts Two and Three.  The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period, 
from approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day, 
August 10, 2019, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC.  As 
charged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated 
counts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false 
certifications attesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the 
SHU were conducted from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 to 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
II. 
Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials 
A. 
The Government’s Discovery Production 
At the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2019, the Court set a discovery deadline 
of December 31, 2019.  On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the 
Government made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the 
following: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by 
Noel and Thomas from August 9 to 10, 2019; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC 
phone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness 
interviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG 
who were participating in the investigation.2 
Subsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more 
limited in scope.  On January 23, 2020, the Government produced additional interview reports and 
The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required 
under Rule 16, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of 
caution.   
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 8 of 34

notes.  On January 30, 2020,3 the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with 
timestamps, and on March 16, 2020, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic 
devices and a photograph of a text message.  
B. 
Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials 
The defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in 
response to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with 
Rule 16 and its other disclosure obligations, as described below. 
At the initial pretrial conference on November 11, 2019, Thomas, through counsel, raised 
the issue of an “ongoing . . . report” by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the 
“status” of the report and when it would be completed.4  (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2019, at 3-4, 7-9).  
In response, the Government explained that “to the extent counsel’s asking for a summary of the 
results of the criminal investigation, obviously we’ll be turning over in discovery all of the 
underlying results of the criminal investigation. . . . I don’t have a time frame on the [I]nspector 
[G]eneral report, but the [G]overnment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery 
materials in this matter, which includes the Rule 16 materials relevant to the criminal charges that 
have been brought against the defendants.”  (Id. at 7-8).  As there was no pending issue to resolve, 
the Court declined to rule at that time. 
On January 29, 2020, Thomas and Noel each submitted discovery requests to the 
Government.  Thomas’s letter reiterated his prior request for “any and all reports, memorandums, 
The January 30, 2020 production was made to Noel’s counsel on January 24, 2020, while 
the Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas’s counsel. 
Based on conversations with attorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the 
Government understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures. 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 9 of 34

written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the 
United States Inspector General.”  Noel’s January 29 letter sought materials related to the MCC 
video surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating 
particular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously 
produced in discovery. 
At the pretrial conference the following day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request 
for “whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with 
respect to the Inspector General’s report.”  (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020, at 6, 9).  The Court directed 
Thomas to file a motion formalizing his request.  (Id. at 9).5 
The Government responded to the defendants’ discovery requests by letter dated March 
14, 2020.  As for Thomas’s request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General’s 
report, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2019 
pretrial conference.  With respect to Noel’s requests for additional materials related to the MCC 
video surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the 
Government’s possession and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced.  In 
addition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel’s questions, 
including video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage. 
On March 27, 2020, Thomas submitted another discovery request to the Government, 
seeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and 
information about the Government’s charging decisions.  The Government responded by letter 
Thomas, through counsel, previewed that he would also likely file a motion to dismiss 
the indictment based on “selective prosecution.”  (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020 at 6).  The deadline for 
filing motions, which was extended at counsel’s request, has passed, and Thomas has failed to 
timely file a motion to dismiss. 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 10 of 34

dated April 1, 2020, explaining that any responsive information in the Government’s possession 
and subject to disclosure had already been produced.  The letter further explained that to the extent 
the requests called for items not in the Government’s possession or not subject to disclosure, 
Thomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was 
not aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested 
information. 
On April 9, 2020, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court 
compelling the Government to produce the following: 
• The Inspector General’s report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein 
and BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the “Inspector 
General’s Report”), as well as all supporting memoranda and other 
documents, (Mot. 4-5); 
• Any and all “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] regarding 
the August 10, 2019 incident” as well as “documents, reports, witness 
statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who 
have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” including “results of any 
disciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding 
the discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who 
have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts,” (Mot. 4, 6);  
• Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents 
created by “any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein,” (Mot. 4, 7).   
For the reasons that follow, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion 
should be denied.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law  
A. 
Brady & Giglio  
The Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely 
disclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession.  See 
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); see also 
United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d Cir. 2001).  Evidence is “material” in this sense 
only if “its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of a trial.”  United States v. Bagley, 
473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985).  “The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all 
the evidence in the Government’s possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of 
his defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only 
known to the Government.”  United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 610, 619 (2d Cir. 1982) (citing 
United States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 604 (2d Cir. 1973)). 
Impeachment evidence is material only “where the witness at issue supplied the only 
evidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness’s 
credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution’s case.”  United States v. 
Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 1210 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Similarly, “where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to 
challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or is subject to 
extensive attack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as 
cumulative, and hence not material.”  United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, 111 (2d Cir. 2011) 
(citing cases).  With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit, 
in Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 12 of 34

demand for it.  267 F.3d at 146.  The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do 
not require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant’s request.  Id.  It 
found that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence 
as well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order 
disclosure of material it deems material as a matter of case management.  Id.  As described above, 
the Government disclosed reports and notes of witness statements as part of its discovery 
productions, such that the defendants will have possessed substantial material that may serve as 
potential impeachment evidence for one year in advance of trial. 
B. 
Rule 16 
Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Government to permit the 
defendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government’s possession, 
custody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to 
use them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant.  
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E).  An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule 16 “if it 
could be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.”  United States v. Stevens, 
985 F.2d 1175, 1180-81 (2d Cir. 1993). 
II. 
Thomas is Not Entitled to Additional Materials 
A. 
The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations 
As an initial matter, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy 
its discovery and disclosure obligations.   
The Government has met its Rule 16 discovery and disclosure obligations.  As set forth 
above, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among 
other things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2019 (despite the fact 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 13 of 34

that the Indictment relates to a 14-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and 
staffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone 
records; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written 
Bureau of Prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials.  In addition and 
while not required by Rule 16, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and now, 
approximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the 
investigation.  While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants 
disclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them. 
The Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio 
obligations.  The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably 
exculpatory or impeaching.  To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or 
attorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the 
Government intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in 
advance of trial to be effectively used.  Based on that representation alone, the defendant’s motion 
should be denied.  See United States v. Gonzalez, No. 19 Cr. 123-2 (NRB), 2020 WL 1809293, at 
*5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (denying a motion to compel because the government “represented 
that it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule 16 obligations); 
United States v. Underwood, No. 04 Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 
2005) (“The courts of this Circuit repeatedly have denied pretrial requests for discovery orders 
pursuant to Brady where the government has made such good faith representations.”); United 
States v. Perez, 940 F. Supp. 540, 553 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying defendant’s motion to compel 
production of Brady based on Government’s representation that it was aware of and had complied 
with Brady).   
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 14 of 34

B. 
The Requested Records Are Not “Material” to Preparing a Defense and Are 
Sought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification  
All of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not “material to preparing a defense” 
under Rule 16, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the 
Government’s false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense.  Instead, Thomas seeks 
evidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies, 
supervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he 
can engage in attempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal 
conduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him.  (Mot. 5, 7, 9, 14).  Thomas is not 
entitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—
that would aid in that nullification effort because Rule 16 only entitles a defendant to discovery 
for purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the 
decision to prosecute.  
1. 
Applicable Law 
An item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is 
discoverable under Rule 16(a)(1)(E) only if it “is material to preparing the defense.”  Fed. R. Crim. 
P. 16(a)(1)(E).  “It is [a defendant’s] burden to make a prima facie showing that documents sought 
under Rule 16(a)(1)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense.”  United States v. Rigas, 258 F. 
Supp. 2d 299, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 894 
(S.D.N.Y. 1991)).  As noted above, an item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule 16 
“if it could be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.”  Stevens, 985 F.2d at 
1180-81.  The defendant must “offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested 
evidence is material.”  Rigas, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 307 (internal citation omitted).   
As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Armstrong, while Rule 16 authorizes 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 15 of 34

defendants to examine records “material to the preparation of their defense against the 
Government’s case in chief,” it does not authorize discovery for defenses that do not rebut the 
“merits to the criminal charge itself.”  517 U.S. 456, 462-63 (1996) (holding that Rule 16 does not 
authorize discovery relating to a selective prosecution claim).  For that reason, because evidence 
that would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification does not relate to the merits of 
the criminal charges, it is not discoverable under Rule 16.  Id.; see also United States v. Defreitas, 
No. 07 Cr. 543 (DLI), 2011 WL 317964, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2011) (rejecting discovery 
request related to something that is “not a defense” and has “nothing to do with the issues of 
whether defendants . . . committed the . . . crimes charged”).  Since jury nullification is “a practice 
whereby a juror votes in purposeful disregard of the evidence,” United States v. Thomas, 116 F.3d 
606, 614 (2d Cir. 1997), or “out of compassion or compromise,” Standefer v. United States, 447 
U.S. 10, 22 (1980) (internal citation omitted), it is not error for a court to preclude evidence that is 
“not a valid defense” aimed at nullification, United States v. Edwards, 101 F.3d 17, 19-20 (2d Cir. 
1996).  See also United States v. Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d 579, 583-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (precluding 
defense arguments or evidence related to “possible consequences for the defendant of conviction, 
jury nullification, and the Government’s motive and conduct in prosecuting [defendant]”); United 
States v. Levin, No. 15 Cr. 101 (KBF), 2016 WL 299031, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2016) (barring 
evidence “intended to elicit sympathy” and attempts to “use jury nullification as a defense” as 
“plainly improper”).  Indeed, “trial courts have the duty to forestall or prevent jury nullification” 
even where the defendant or the court may “strongly disagree[] with the government’s charging 
decisions and the attendant sentencing consequences.”  United States v. Manzano, 945 F.3d 616, 
626-27 (2d Cir. 2019) (citations & quotation marks omitted).

2. 
Discussion 
Thomas’s motion makes clear that he intends for his principal defense at trial to be that—
irrespective of his guilt or innocence of the false statements charges—he should be acquitted 
because the MCC was understaffed, Thomas was overworked, his supervisors did not catch his 
crime in the moment, and falsification of count slips is rampant within the BOP.  (See Mot. 3 
(“staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP 
procedures go to the heart of his defense to the government’s criminal allegations”); 9 (“Mr. 
Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2019 led 
to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is now criminally charged.”)).  Thomas has failed to meet 
his burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid 
defense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead 
would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification.   
The purported reasons for Thomas’s decision to falsify count slips—being tired, 
overworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those 
issues is not relevant.  Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas 
intentionally made materially false statements and also that did so while tired or overworked, it 
would still be required to convict him.  See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 213, 221 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(holding that “it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the 
defendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense 
with which he was charged” (internal citation omitted)).   
None of Thomas’s proffered excuses relate to proving or rebutting the elements of a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false, 
whether it was material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knowingly 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 17 of 34

and willfully made a false statement.  Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a 
criminal agreement with his co-defendant.  Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly 
innocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent.  See United States 
v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent 
motive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is “knowingly and willfully”); In re Terrorist 
Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, 154 n.49 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Washington, 
705 F.2d at 493, for “the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional”); 
United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. 1992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context 
argument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).   
For the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or 
conspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the 
foregoing elements.  Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees 
falsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of 
what other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent.  (Mot. 6.)  Not so.  Whether Thomas 
believed falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the 
charges against him.  See United States v. Southland Corp., 760 F.2d 1366, 1372 (2d Cir. 1985) 
(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United 
States v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 601 n.2 (3d Cir. 1972) (“As long as the inexcusable intent is 
present, it is not necessary that the defendant know that his conduct is subject to criminal 
penalties.”).  And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial, 
for the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged 
here, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  See United States v. Gibbons, 602 F.2d 
1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 18 of 34

were not on trial). 
Thomas’s efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for 
his own criminal actions plainly sound in nullification.  See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84; 
Levin, 2016 WL 2990831, at *12.  Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the 
defendant committed the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or 
compromise from the jury.  The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the 
nullification evidence precluded in Armstrong and its progeny.  See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 462-
(defendant not entitled to discovery on race of other narcotics defendants to aid in selective 
prosecution claim); United States v. Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2015) (rejecting defendant’s “demands for general information and statistics 
relating to the Government’s use of sting operations”); United States v. Floyd, No. 99 Cr. 0234 
(DAB), 1999 WL 476438, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 1999) (rejecting discovery request for 
“background data, records and investigative reports” of the New York City Police Department 
(“NYPD”) as well as information about NYPD officers’ conduct in other cases); Defreitas, 2011 
WL 317964, at *10 (rejecting discovery demands related to a “factual impossibility” defense to a 
conspiracy charge).  It is the Court’s “duty to forestall or prevent” jury nullification.  Manzano, 
945 F.3d at 627 (holding that “District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification 
arguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could 
argue jury nullification.”); see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
(criticizing trial court for inviting nullification by permitting the defendants to mount a “political 
defense” and stating that it was an “erroneous assumption that good motive for committing a crime 
is inconsistent with criminal intent”).  
In sum, much of the additional discovery Thomas seeks in his motion relates to legally 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 19 of 34

irrelevant matters, such as what “led” him to the criminal conduct or the broader “context” in 
which he committed specific criminal acts.  There is no basis to compel production of evidence 
related to those matters under Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because 
the evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent attempt at nullification.  Thomas’s motion 
should be denied on this basis alone.   
C. 
The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who 
Were Not Part of the Prosecution Team 
Thomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce “any reports, witness 
statements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the 
BOP,” “documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC 
employees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” and any previously undisclosed 
reports, witness statements, and documents created by “any other federal agencies that investigated 
the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein.”  (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)).  Even 
if Thomas had satisfied the materiality requirement under Rule 16 or Brady with respect to these 
items—and he has not—Thomas’s motion would still fail because the materials he seeks are not 
in the prosecution team’s possession. 
The BOP is not, and never has been, part of the prosecution team.  Nor did the BOP conduct 
an investigation jointly or in coordination with the prosecution team.6  To require the Government 
to obtain and produce any records from the BOP from a separate investigation, as well as evidence 
that would support Thomas’s purported (and improper, for the reasons discussed in Part II.B, 
The defendant claims, based on a CNN article, that the U.S. Marshal Service (“USMS”) 
conducted an investigation.  The Government is unaware of such an investigation, and in any 
event, any such inquiry by the USMS was not conducted jointly or in coordination with the 
prosecution team.   
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 20 of 34

supra) defenses, is not legally required and would impose a nearly insurmountable obligation on 
the Government of marshaling and reviewing information and data in the possession of an entirely 
separate entity. 
1. 
Applicable Law  
As described above, Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government’s 
“possession.”  As a general matter, while “[a]n individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have 
knowledge of all information gathered in connection with his office’s investigation of the 
case, . . . knowledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does 
not in all instances warrant the imputation of knowledge to the prosecutor.”  United States v. 
Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).  The imposition of such “an 
unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor’s office 
on the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government’ 
that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.”  Id. (citation & 
quotation marks omitted); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995) (Government’s 
discovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor 
or “others acting on the government’s behalf in the case”).  Thus, discovery and disclosure 
obligations only extend “information known to persons who are a part of the ‘prosecution 
team’ . . . who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of 
the case,” including “police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the 
prosecutor and participate in the investigation.”  United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App’x 36, 38 (2d 
Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information 
in the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense.  See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 21 of 34

56, 112 (2d Cir. 2003) (defendants were not deprived of due process by any alleged failure of U.S. 
government to help them obtain cooperation from foreign authorities).   
In considering whether Rule 16 and Brady apply to records in the possession of another 
government agency, a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing such evidence only where the 
Government conducts a “joint investigation” with that agency or branch of government.  See 
United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming district court opinion holding that 
there was “no joint investigation with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)]” and 
therefore the Government did not need to produce documents in the custody of the SEC); United 
States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 742-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that the Government 
was not obligated to review SEC material for Brady where SEC was not involved in grand jury 
presentation, did not attend every interview, did not review documents gathered only by 
prosecution, and did not develop prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 
(JPO), 2018 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (holding that the Government was 
not required to conduct a search because the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(“PCAOB”)] was not involved in witness interviews or developing prosecutorial strategy, and the 
SEC was not involved in the grand jury presentation, reviewing the fruits of the Government’s 
investigation, or developing prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 
241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (no joint investigation between Government and SEC); United States v. 
Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Chin, J.) (no joint investigation between 
Government and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)); United States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 
727, 749-50 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (holding that USAO and Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) 
did not conduct a “joint investigation” even though the FAA provided two inspectors to assist the 
criminal investigation). 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 22 of 34

Moreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an 
investigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 720, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“While the prosecution’s [Rule 
16] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knowledge 
of the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knowledge of 
the entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned.”); United 
States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 218 (3d Cir. 2005) (“[T]hat other agents in the ([Department of 
Labor (“DOL”)] participated in this investigation does not mean that the entire DOL is properly 
considered part of the prosecution team.”); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 949 (2d 
Cir.1993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to impute to AUSAs prosecuting that action with the 
assistance of certain FBI agents knowledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were 
“uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); but see United States v. Ghailani, 687 
F. Supp. 2d 365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other 
members of the Department of Justice who were involved in making decisions about timing and 
progress of the case were part of the “government” for Rule 16 purposes).   
Thus, as the foregoing precedents recognize, the factors relevant in determining whether 
an agency or a component of an agency are part of the prosecution team, and therefore their records 
are in the “possession” of the Government include whether the agency or component: “(1) 
participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the 
grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4) 
played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to 
court proceedings.”  Middendorf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4.

2. 
Discussion  
As described above, the Government has produced Brady, Giglio, and Rule 16 material in 
the possession of the prosecutors and agents at the United States Attorney’s Office, the FBI, and 
the DOJ-OIG who have worked on this investigation and prosecution.  Thomas seeks materials 
that are not in the possession of the United States Attorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI 
and DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.  
Thomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP.  The BOP was not a member of the 
prosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic 
decisions about the prosecution of the case.  Indeed, the Government obtained records from the 
MCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and written 
requests to the MCC’s legal department.  Likewise, the Government was not involved in any 
internal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide.  Notwithstanding 
those facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the 
Government’s discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the 
possession of the BOP.  That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is settled law in this 
Circuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or 
control of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint 
investigation” with that agency.  None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as 
discussed in the foregoing case law, is present here.  A straightforward application of those factors 
considered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did 
not participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case 
to the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 24 of 34

Government; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel 
accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings.   
Moreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into 
the events of August 9 and 10, 2019 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe 
that most if not all of the records that he seeks—such as records of other instances of BOP 
employees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP’s investigation.  There 
is simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the 
possession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case, 
regarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct 
required rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other 
times also allegedly falsified records.   
The cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result.  In United States v. Bryan, the 
Ninth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents 
located in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS 
investigation.  868 F.2d 1032, 1035-37 (9th Cir. 1989).  In reaching that holding, the Circuit 
explained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might 
have documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule 16’s disclosure requirements are cabined 
to anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the 
defendant.”  Id. at 1036 (emphasis added).  Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 
204, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that 
“[c]ourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrowly to mean the prosecutors in the 
particular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant, 
and not the ‘government’ in general.”  And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp. 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 25 of 34

2d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2006), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice 
President and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not 
participate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited 
by another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit.     
Finally, even if such materials had any conceivable relevance to the charges at hand (which, 
as discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the 
BOP’s records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of 
documents, attempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2005, and parsing through 
attorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for attorneys for 
the Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knows 
of no effective way to search them.  It would, as the Circuit warned against in Avellino, “condemn 
the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.”  136 F.3d at 255.  Such a result is not 
legally required by Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas’s motion should be denied.  
D. 
Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to Disclosure  
Thomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be 
produced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP, 
including purported staffing shortages at the MCC.  (Mot. 5, 9-10).  For the reasons set forth above, 
any draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will 
discuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports, 
to the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege.  While 
the prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the 
Government understands that those attorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report 
have not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term.  As 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 26 of 34

such, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas’s motion can be denied on that 
reason alone.  Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet 
exist—fails for two additional reasons. 
First, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will 
likely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the 
deliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions, 
recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions 
and policies are formulated.’”  Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 
U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)).  The 
privilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Fernandez, 231 F.3d 1240, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2000) (government’s death penalty 
evaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative 
process privilege); In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737-40 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (indicating that the 
privilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284 
(S.D.N.Y. 1998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege).  “In order for the privilege to apply, 
the agency record at issue must be (1) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter; (2) 
pre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.”  Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d 
150, 155 (2d Cir. 2020).  “It is well-settled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically 
pre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors; 
views that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their 
superiors.”  Color of Change v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 
2018) (quoting Amnesty Int’l USA v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)).  
The Inspector General’s Report is both pre-decisional and deliberative.  A full draft has not 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 27 of 34

been completed, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public.  
It is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those 
recommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being 
finalized and publicly announced.  Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in 
reaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports.  The ability to have these 
discussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues.  Here, disclosure 
of any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine 
the DOJ-OIG’s ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to 
inmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on 
the issues.  Accordingly, Thomas’s motion should be denied for the reason that the materials 
sought are protected by the deliberative process privilege.  Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. 
Second, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector 
General’s Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials 
upon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure.  To the extent that the forthcoming 
Inspector General’s Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and 
prosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and 10, 
2019, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed 
to the defendants.  Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may “possibl[y]” 
have generated additional witness statements and “other information” that has not been produced 
by the Government to date.  (Mot. 5).  Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides 
mere speculation.  The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based attorneys who are 
preparing the Inspector General’s Report.  Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution’s 
understanding that those attorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 28 of 34

discovered any potential Brady material.  As such, given that the prosecution has already produced 
in discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG attorneys preparing the Report, the 
underlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’ 
possession.  Any analysis of those materials by the attorneys preparing the Inspector General’s 
Report is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule 16 and cannot constitute Brady material.  See 
United States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d 148, 150 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting generally that “nothing contained 
in [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).   
At bottom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft, 
unpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not 
required by Rule 16, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation. 
E. 
Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material 
in Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim   
Thomas seeks “information and statistics that show the conduct in which the defendant is 
being charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of 
criminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.”  (Mot. 7.)  This request, which is effectively a 
demand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only 
for the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite 
showing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim.  Indeed, Thomas 
has failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or 
discriminatory purpose.   
1. 
Applicable Law  
“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, 
but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by 
the Constitution.”  Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468.  The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 29 of 34

one,” id., as the defendant must “overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of 
federal prosecutors, and ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they 
have properly discharged their official duties.’”  United States v. Sanders, 17 F. Supp. 2d 141, 144 
(E.D.N.Y. 1998) (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464), aff’d, 211 F.3d 711 (2d Cir. 2000).   
A defendant claiming selective prosecution must present “clear evidence” that the decision 
to prosecute not only (1) “had a discriminatory effect” but was also (2) “motivated by a 
discriminatory purpose.”  Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 173 
(2d Cir. 2003); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1992); United States v. Moon, 718 
F.2d 1210, 1229 (2d Cir. 1983).  “The discriminatory effect prong requires a showing that 
‘similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted.’”  Alameh, 341 
F.3d at 173 (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465).  In other words, the defendant must show that 
he has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class.  Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon, 
718 F.2d at 1229).  To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must show that the 
Government’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in 
bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to 
prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.”  Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration 
incorporated).  Where a defendant “has not shown that the Government prosecuted him because 
of” his protected status or conduct, his claim fails.  Id.   
In order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer 
“some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense.”  
Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974)); 
United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2002) (per curiam) (to obtain discovery, a defendant 
accordingly first “must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 30 of 34

intent”); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same).  “[T]he showing necessary to obtain discovery should itself 
be a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.”  Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464.  
“Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient” to meet this 
burden.  Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 470 (affidavits “recount[ing] 
hearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not sufficient to 
justify discovery); Berrios, 501 F.2d at 1211 (affidavit from defendant and attorney that they 
“believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went 
unprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 341 F.3d at 174 (defendant’s statistical analysis was 
insufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim).   
2. 
Discussion 
Thomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or 
“discriminatory application” claim.  He has not carried his burden through a showing of any 
evidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.   
As to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any 
evidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of 
conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].”  Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who 
has committed roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom 
the law has not been enforced.”  United States v. Lewis, 517 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 2008).  Thomas 
alleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2005 or 2006 wherein officers failed to 
conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide,” and one of the four 
officers involved was given a suspension.  (Mot. 6).  But Thomas is not charged with failing to 
conduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts.  Even assuming 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 31 of 34

those officers “in 2005 or 2006” did falsify count slips, Thomas has still not put forth any evidence 
that those officers were “outside of the protected class,” meaning of a different race, gender, 
nationality, or other protected class than Thomas.  In any event, even were the conduct similar, 
that Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally 
prosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness. 
Similarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-1” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment, 
who falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. institutional counts on 
August 9, 2019, respectively, were not prosecuted.  (Mot. 10; Ind. ¶¶ 15, 17, 19).  Even assuming 
arguendo that Officer-1 and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified 
one count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that 
either Officer-1 or Officer-2 were outside of a “protected class” to which Thomas belongs.7  Nor 
could he: Officer-1 and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas.  Thomas 
also questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas’s 
false count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or 
personnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false 
statements—Thomas did.  In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the “suspicion [and] 
surmise” contained in Thomas’s motion simply do not constitute “objective evidence” warranting 
discovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir. 1992) (conclusory allegations as to 
timing of indictment, Government’s failure to follow internal guidelines, and improprieties of 
In so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or 
the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion.  It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas’s 
claim that the lack of charges against Officer-1, Officer-2, or Thomas’s supervisors is in and of 
itself sufficient to meet the defendant’s burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated 
defendant who was not charged.   
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 32 of 34

prosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 718 F.2d at 1230 (“to engage 
in a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or 
surmise”).  Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary showing in support of the first required prong 
means that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied.  See, e.g., 
Bass, 536 U.S. at 863.   
As to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that 
the decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  To make such a 
showing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for 
prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations 
as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.”  Fares, 978 F.2d at 
(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration incorporated).  Thomas has not put forth any 
evidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything 
other than his guilt.  Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at 
all, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is 
“rampant” within the BOP.  (Mot. 7).  But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for 
committing the crime that Thomas committed does not mean that the Government harbored 
discriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.8  
Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has 
failed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective 
prosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather 
than the jury.”  Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082.  The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense.  A claim of 
improper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to 
the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge 
for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.”  Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463.  Instead, it is self-
evidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be 
decided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.  
Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
(criticizing admission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 35     Filed 04/24/20     Page 33 of 34

Having failed to meet the “rigorous standard” required to obtain discovery on a selective 
prosecution defense, Thomas’s requests for discovery of any materials related to other incidents 
in which officers were not prosecuted for falsifying count slips should be denied.  Armstrong, 517 
U.S. at 464.   
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s motion to compel should be denied.

ELECTRONICALLY FILED

DATEFILED:

Cr. 830-2 (AT) 
ORDER 
On November 19, 2019, Defendant Michael Thomas was charged with one count of 
conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of 
making false statements with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or 
proper administration of a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United 
States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 100l(a)(3). ECF No. 1. The indictment alleges that Thomas, 
in his capacity as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the "MCC"), 
along with another officer, co-Defendant Tova Noel, submitted several false "count slips" on the 
night of August 9, 2019 and the morning of August 10, 2019, certifying that he conducted counts 
of the inmates he was supervising in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"), even though he 
did not conduct those counts. Id. tj[tj[ 16, 30, 36, 38, 40. During that time period, one of the 
inmates in the SHU-Jeffrey Epstein-hanged himself in his cell. Id. tj[tj[ 1, 2fr27. 
Thomas now moves to compel the Government to produce evidence in connection with 
the trial scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021. Motion, ECF No. 33. Thomas seeks three 
categories of information: (1) "[t]he report of the Inspector General" for the United States 
Department of Justice related to Epstein's death, and "any and all supplemental memorandums, 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports" obtained by the Inspector General's 
investigation, id, at 5; (2) "[a]ny and all internal investigative reports created by the [Bureau of 

Prisons (the “BOP”)] as to both [D]efendants, including[] any and all supporting memorandums, 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports,” id. at 6; and (3) “any and all reports, 
memorandums, written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured, or 
possessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies[] participating in the investigation of the 
[D]efendants, allied with the prosecution, and to which the prosecution has access,” id. at 7. 
  For the reasons stated below, Thomas’ motion is DENIED. 
DISCUSSION 
The Government has already produced “surveillance video going back to July 5, 
2019 . . . ; count slips, thirty minute round forms, and staffing rosters for the three-week period 
surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone records; employee files and staffing history 
for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written [BOP] policies and regulations,” as well as 
“statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the investigation.”  Gov’t Opp. at 8–9, 
ECF No. 35. 
Thomas argues that he is entitled to additional discovery on two grounds:  (1) Rule 16 of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and (2) the constitutional guarantee of due process as 
expressed by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and 
Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972).  Motion at 1. 
I. 
Legal Standards 
A. Rule 16 
Rule 16 requires the Government to “permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or 
photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is within the government’s possession, 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 2 of 9

custody, or control and:  (i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii) the [G]overnment 
intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs 
to the defendant.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E).  “Evidence is material if it could be used to 
counter the [G]overnment’s case or to bolster a defense.”  United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 
109 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds 
by Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018).  “In order to compel the Government to 
produce certain evidence, a defendant must make a prima facie showing of materiality, and must 
offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.”  United States 
v. Abdalla, 317 F. Supp. 3d 786, 790 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted).  “There must be some indication that the pretrial disclosure of the disputed evidence 
would enable the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.”  United 
States v. Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 261 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks, citation, 
and alterations omitted). 
Evidence is “within the [G]overnment’s possession, custody, or control” if “(1) it has 
actually reviewed [the evidence], or (2) [the evidence is] in the possession, custody, or control of 
a government agency so closely aligned with the prosecution so as to be considered part of the 
prosecution team.”  United States v. Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).  
“Legal ownership of the requested documents or things is not determinative, nor is actual 
possession necessary if the party has control of the items.  Control has been defined to include 
the legal right to obtain the documents requested upon demand.  The term ‘control’ is broadly 
construed.”  United States v. Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 350, 361 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted) (collecting cases). 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 3 of 9

If the Government represents that it “it has fully complied with [its Rule 16] obligations 
and will continue to do so,” the defendant must put forward some “compelling demonstration to 
the contrary” by pointing to a “specific failure by the Government to comply with its disclosure 
obligations” in order to justify a motion to compel.  United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28, 
(S.D.N.Y. 2005). 
B. Brady/Giglio 
Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government “has a 
constitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material 
to guilt or punishment,” and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to 
“not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key 
[G]overnment witness.”  United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001).  “Evidence is 
material within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the 
evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”  Turner v. 
United States, 137 S. Ct. 1885, 1893 (2017) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration 
omitted)); see also Coppa, 267 F.3d at 135 (“[T]he prosecutor must disclose evidence if, without 
such disclosure, a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome of a trial in which the 
evidence had been disclosed would have been different.”). 
“The prosecution’s obligation to disclose Brady material extends to any material in the 
possession of any entity that has acted as an ‘arm of the prosecutor’ in a given case.”  United 
States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 36, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) 
(quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 741 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)).  “A 
prosecutor’s duty to review documents in the possession, custody, or control of another agency 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 4 of 9

arises where the Government conducts a joint investigation with another agency.”  United States 
v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted).  In determining whether the prosecution has conducted a joint investigation, courts in 
this district look to a number of non-exhaustive factors, “including whether the other agency:  (1) 
participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to 
the grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, 
(4) played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the 
prosecution to court proceedings.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
As under Rule 16, if the Government has represented that it is aware of and has complied 
with its Brady and Giglio obligations, a defendant must make a “particularized showing that 
materials exist requiring disclosure” in order to sustain a motion to compel.  United States v. 
Juliano, No. 99 Cr. 1197, 2000 WL 640644, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2000); see United States v. 
Evanchik, 413 F.2d 950, 953 (2d Cir. 1969) (“[T]he assurance by the [G]overnment that it has in 
its possession no undisclosed evidence that would tend to exculpate defendant justifies the denial 
of a motion for inspection that does not make some particularized showing of materiality and 
usefulness.”) 
II. 
Inspector General Materials 
Thomas seeks disclosure of both the investigatory materials from the Department of 
Justice Office of the Inspector General’s (“OIG”) investigation regarding Epstein’s death, and a 
draft of the Inspector General’s report arising from that investigation.  Motion at 5.  The 
Government concedes that attorneys from OIG participated in the Government’s investigation 
that led to the indictment of Thomas.  Gov’t Opp. at 3, 19.  But, the Government represents that 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 5 of 9

it has already delivered to Thomas all of the materials gathered by OIG personnel in the course 
of investigating this case, and that “it is the prosecution’s understanding that [OIG] attorneys 
have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise discovered any potential Brady 
material.”  Id. at 23–24.  Thomas has not identified any specific material that might be in OIG’s 
possession that has not been disclosed. 
The Court, therefore, has no basis to compel the Government to disclose additional 
evidence underlying the Inspector General’s report.  “[C]ourts in this circuit have repeatedly 
denied requests for discovery orders where the [G]overnment represents that it has produced 
discovery to defendants pursuant to Rule 16 and has made a good faith representation to the 
defense that it recognizes and has complied with its obligations under Brady and its progeny.”  
United States v. Garcia-Pena, No. 17 Cr. 363, 2018 WL 6985220, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 
2018) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted); see also, e.g., United States v. 
Blondet, No. 16 Cr. 387, 2019 WL 5690711, at *5 (“[T]o the extent that these motions seek 
evidence pursuant to Brady [], Giglio [], and their progeny, they are [denied] on the basis of the 
Government’s good-faith representation that it has complied with its obligations and will 
continue to do so.” (citations omitted)); United States v. Goode, No. 16 Cr. 529, 2018 WL 
919928, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2018) (“The Government represents that it has complied with 
Rule 16 obligations; the Rule 16 requests are therefore moot.” (citation omitted)). 
As for the draft Inspector General’s report itself, the Government reports that “attorneys 
from [OIG] responsible for writing the [r]eport have not yet completed a draft, and do not 
anticipate completing the [r]eport in the near term,” and so “there are no drafts of the [r]eport to 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 6 of 9

disclose.”  Gov’t Opp. at 21–22.  The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to 
produce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.1   
Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel disclosure of materials related to the Inspector 
General’s investigation is DENIED. 
III. 
BOP Materials 
Thomas also seeks disclosure of “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] 
regarding” Epstein’s death, and “any and all documents, reports, witness statements and 
disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct” similar to 
that alleged against Thomas.  Motion at 6.  However, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the 
Government reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation.  Nor has he shown that 
BOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in 
presenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents 
with the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,” 
“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the 
investigation that led to the charges against him.  Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).  There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP 
personnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment.  Thus, the 
Court concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule 16 and 
Brady.  
To be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing 
alone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution.  “The court cannot find that 
Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address 
whether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it is protected 
by the deliberative process privilege.  See Gov’t Opp. at 12–15, 22–23. 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 7 of 9

the government is in constructive possession of the materials where, as here, defendant has not 
presented any evidence suggesting that the BOP was involved in the investigation or prosecution 
of this case.”  United States v. Rivera, No. 13 Cr. 149, 2015 WL 1540517, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 
7, 2015); see, e.g., United States v. Merlino, 349 F.3d 144, 155 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that 
Government did not violate Brady obligation in failing to turn over tapes in BOP possession 
because “the BOP was not part of the prosecutorial arm of the federal government as it was not 
at all involved in either the investigation or the prosecution of the defendants”); United States v. 
Battle, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1201–02 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (“Defendant implies that because the 
BOP employees are connected with the Department of Justice that the prosecution team 
constructively possessed exculpatory information that could have been within the knowledge of 
BOP staff. . . . Even if the Court assumes that some members of the BOP staff did possess 
favorable information that alone does not impute knowledge to the prosecution team.” (citing 
United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998)). 
Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence in the 
possession of the BOP is DENIED. 
IV. 
Other Materials 
Finally, Thomas seeks disclosure of information that he argues will tend to show that the 
conduct for which he is being prosecuted was:  “1) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with 
knowledge and acquiescence by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies 
that forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally, 
and; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory application of BOP policies 
by [G]overnment prosecutors.”  Motion at 7.  But Thomas has not provided support for his 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 8 of 9

assertion that the Government, or any other agency that has operated as an arm of the 
prosecution, is in possession or control of evidence that relates to the prevalence of falsifying 
count slips in federal correctional facilities, or BOP leadership’s tolerance of such practices. 
Moreover, to the extent that Thomas is seeking discovery in support of a selective 
prosecution defense, he has not met the “rigorous” standard that applies for obtaining discovery 
in aid of such a claim.  United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 468 (1996).  “[A] defendant 
who seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must show some evidence of both 
discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.”  United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 
(2002).  Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of 
false count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submitted false documents in 
other circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in 
any protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.  
See Motion at 10.  Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his 
prosecution.  
Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the 
submission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery 
related to selective prosecution, is DENIED. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED.  The Clerk of Court is 
directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 33. 
SO ORDERED.

is available for trial beginning on September 27, 2021, and counsel for Thomas is available for 
trial from August 16-27 and after September 15, 2021.  The Government is available for trial at

                                                 Defendants.   
ANALISA TORRES, District Judge: 
The Court has reviewed the parties’ letter dated April 15, 2021, setting forth their 
available dates for trial, ECF No. 50.  Due to conflicts in the Court’s and the parties’ availability 
in the third quarter of 2021, the Court, utilizing the procedures within this District governing the 
scheduling of jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, will instead seek to schedule a jury 
trial for the fourth calendar quarter of 2021.  By July 16, 2021, the parties shall submit blackout 
dates for trial.      
The time between June 14, 2021 and October 1, 2021 is excluded under the Speedy Trial 
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice.  The Court finds that the ends of 
justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the public and Defendants 
in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently administer the Court's 
docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties to prepare for trial and 
to discuss potential pretrial disposition.

Re: 
United States v. Noel and Thomas, 19 Cr. 830 (AT) 
Dear Judge Torres: 
The Government submits this letter to inform the Court that the parties have entered into 
deferred prosecution agreements (the “Agreements”), which have been approved by Pretrial 
Services and are included for the Court’s consideration.1  After a thorough investigation, and based 
on the facts of this case and the personal circumstances of the defendants, the Government has 
determined that the interests of justice will best be served by deferring prosecution in this District.  
The proposed Agreements contemplate an additional six-month term of supervision by Pretrial 
Services and, in addition to the standard terms of pretrial supervision, the proposed Agreements 
include the additional salient terms: 
• The defendants will cooperate with a pending Department of Justice Office of Inspector 
General review by providing truthful information related to their employment by the 
Bureau of Prisons, including about the events and circumstances described in the 
Indictment; and 
• The defendants will complete 100 hours of community service, preferably in an area related 
to the criminal justice system. 
The defendants have consented to the entry of the Agreements and have also admitted that 
they “willfully and knowingly completed materially false count and round slips regarding required 
counts and rounds in the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 
9, 2019 and August 10, 2019.”   
The Government respectfully requests, with the consent of the defendants, through counsel, 
that the Court schedule a hearing date for entry of the Agreements.  Having conferred with defense 
counsel, all parties are available to proceed by video conference on Tuesday, May 25, 2021, should 
As the deferred prosecution agreements are not final until they are approved by the Court, the 
Government has not filed them publicly with this letter.

TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, 
                                                 Defendants.   
ANALISA TORRES, District Judge: 
This Order is entered, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f) and the Due 
Process Protections Act, Pub. L. No 116–182, 134 Stat. 894 (Oct. 21, 2020), to confirm the 
Government’s disclosure obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny, 
and to summarize the possible consequences of violating those obligations. 
The Government must disclose to the defense all information “favorable to an accused” that is 
“material either to guilt or to punishment” and that is known to the Government.  Id. at 87.  This 
obligation applies regardless of whether the defendant requests this information or whether the 
information would itself constitute admissible evidence.  The Government shall disclose such 
information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes known to the Government so that the 
defense may make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case. 
As part of these obligations, the Government must disclose any information that can be used 
to impeach the trial testimony of a Government witness within the meaning of Giglio v. United 
States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and its progeny.  Such information must be disclosed sufficiently in 
advance of trial in order for the defendant to make effective use of it at trial or at such other time as 
the Court may order.1 
This Order does not purport to set forth an exhaustive list of the Government’s disclosure 
obligations.

The foregoing obligations are continuing ones and apply to materials that become known to 
the Government in the future.  These obligations also apply to information that is otherwise subject to 
disclosure regardless of whether the Government credits it. 
In the event the Government believes that a disclosure under this Order would compromise 
witness safety, victim rights, national security, a sensitive law-enforcement technique, or any other 
substantial government interest, it may apply to the Court for a modification of its obligations, which 
may include in camera review or withholding or subjecting to a protective order all or part of the 
information otherwise subject to disclosure.2 
For purposes of this Order, the Government has an affirmative obligation to seek all 
information subject to disclosure under this Order from all current or former federal, state, and local 
prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and other officers who have participated in the prosecution, or 
investigation that led to the prosecution, of the offense or offenses with which the defendant is 
charged.  
If the Government fails to comply with this Order, the Court, in addition to ordering 
production of the information, may: 
(1) specify the terms and conditions of such production; 
(2) grant a continuance; 
(3) impose evidentiary sanctions;  
(4) impose contempt or other sanctions on any lawyer responsible for violations of the 
Government’s disclosure obligations, or refer the matter to disciplinary authorities; 
(5) dismiss charges before trial or vacate a conviction after trial or a guilty plea; or 
The Classified Information Procedures Act sets forth separate procedures to be followed in the 
event that the Government believes matters relating to classified information may arise in connection 
with the prosecution.  See 18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 1 et seq.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America 
v. 
Michael Thomas, 
Defendant. 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
Cr. 830 (AT) 
TO: 
MICHAEL THOMAS 
On November 19, 2019, a grand jury sitting in this District returned a six-count indictment
(the “Indictment”), which charged Michael Thomas (“you”) with committing offenses against the 
United States, to wit, conspiring to knowingly defraud the United States and to knowingly make 
and use a false writing or document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of knowingly 
making and using a false writing or document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  However, after a 
thorough investigation, and based on the facts of this case and your personal circumstances, the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”) has determined 
that the interests of justice will best be served by deferring prosecution in this District.  Upon your 
acceptance of responsibility for your behavior and by your signature on this deferred prosecution 
agreement (the “Agreement”), prosecution will be deferred during the term of your behavior and 
satisfactory compliance with the terms of this Agreement for the period of six months from the 
date of this Agreement.   
The terms and conditions constituting your good behavior and satisfactory compliance are 
as follows: 
(1)
You shall refrain from violating any federal, state, or local law.  You shall immediately
contact your U.S. Pretrial Services Officer if arrested or questioned by a law-
enforcement officer.
(2)
You shall associate only with law-abiding persons.
(3)
You shall work regularly at a lawful occupation, regularly attend school, and/or support
or care for your legal dependents, if any, to the best of your ability, as approved by your
U.S. Pretrial Services Officer.  You shall notify your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services
Officer prior to any work or school changes.
(4)
You shall not leave the contiguous United States without permission of your
supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer.  In accordance with this condition, the U.S.
Pretrial Services Office shall return your passport upon the Court’s entering this
Agreement, and shall do so indefinitely unless this Agreement is violated.

(6) 
You shall follow your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer’s instructions and

As a further condition you hereby consent to disclosure, by any federal, state, or local 
government agency, or by any medical or substance abuse treatment provider, to the U.S. Pretrial 
Services Officer supervising your case, of such medical and treatment records as may be requested 
by the Pretrial Services Officer to evaluate deferral of prosecution in this case.  You further agree 
that you will execute any additional consent forms that any such agency or provider may require 
to release such information. 
Special conditions are as follows: 
You shall truthfully and completely disclose all information with respect to the activities 
of yourself and others related to your employment by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), which 
information can be used for any purpose.  You shall agree to meet with and be interviewed by the 
USAO-SDNY, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, Office of the 
Inspector General (“DOJ-OIG”), and any other law enforcement agency designated by this Office. 
You shall complete 100 documented hours of community service, preferably related to the 
criminal justice system, including working with recently released inmates.  The specific type of 
community service to be performed must be approved by your Pretrial Services Officer. 
The USAO-SDNY may at any time revoke or modify any condition of this provisional 
release or change the period of such supervision, which shall in no case exceed six months.  The 
USAO-SDNY may discharge you from supervision at any time.  The USAO-SDNY may at any 
time proceed with the prosecution for this offense should the USAO-SDNY, in its sole discretion, 
deem such action advisable. 
If upon completion of your supervision a written report from your supervising U.S. Pretrial 
Services Officer is received to the effect that you have complied with all the rules, regulations and 
conditions and special conditions applicable to your deferred prosecution, no further prosecution 
will be instituted in this District for the above offenses. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to preclude the BOP or the DOJ-OIG from 
taking any administrative action against you, including suspension or termination of employment, 
based on the facts alleged in the Indictment, the facts identified in the course of the investigation 
that led to the Indictment, or your own statements to the DOJ-OIG or any other law enforcement 
entity.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to require the BOP or the DOJ-OIG to delay

Agreement.  You agree that a copy of this Agreement, including your admission and acceptance

If you successfully complete the term of supervision and fulfills all the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, the Government will move the Court to dismiss the Indictment as to

are limited to the facts and circumstances of this case and lack precedential value.

Re: 
US v. Tova Noel, et al 
Docket # 19 cr. 830 (AT) 
Order to Release Firearm and any other Property 
Dear Judge Torres: 
On January 3, 2022, the Court filed the fully executed Nolle Prosequi Order formally 
terminating the prosecution and dismissing all criminal charges in the above 
referenced criminal action.  In November of 2019, Ms. Tova Noel was released with 
conditions.  One of the conditions required the surrender of her firearm to the New 
York City Police Department (NYPD).  As required, Ms. Noel promptly surrendered 
her firearm to the 44th Precinct of the NYPD in the Bronx. 
On January 4, 2022, Ms. Noel went to the 44th Precinct to retrieve her firearm with 
a copy of the Nolle Prosequi Order.  She was referred to the NYPD property clerk’s 
office located in the basement of the Bronx Criminal Court.  The NYPD property clerk 
was presented with the Nolle Prosequi Order, however, the property clerk refused to 
release the firearm.  The NYPD property clerk indicated that they would only release 
the firearm pursuant to a court order. 
Attached is a proposed order mandating the release of Ms. Noel’s firearm and any 
other property that was surrendered as a condition of release.  I have spoken with 
the Government regarding this application, and they have no objection.  Thank you 
for your thoughtful consideration. 
Sincerely,
