mmor. 
5. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State ofNew York. 
6. 
This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million. 
7. 
This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
8. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) as a substantial 
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations 
9. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
10. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one 
of his victims. 
11. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
12. 
An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/25/2008   Page 3 of 7
Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
13. 
Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at 
Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, 
who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen 
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition 
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter 
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and 
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and 
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
14. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room 
with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/25/2008   Page 4 of 7
removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He demanded that Jane remove her 
clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her 
underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane. 
15. 
After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought 
Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane 
to him. 
16. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. 
COUNTI 
Sexual Assault 
17. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats 
and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 above. 
18.

19. 
This sexual assault was in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes, which 
recognizes as a crime the lewd and lascivious acts committed by Epstein upon Jane. 
20. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein's assault on Jane, she has suffered and will 
continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and 
emotional damages. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian,

INTERVENOR'S COMPLAINT 
Intervenor-Plaintiff, JANE DOE's MOTHER, individually and as parent and natural 
guardian of JANE DOE NO. 1, by and through the undersigned counsel, brings this Complaint 
against Defendant JEFFREY EPSTEIN, and as grounds states as follows: 
Parties, Jurisdiction and Venue 
1. Jane Doe No. 1 is a citizen and resident of the State of Florida. She is a minor under the 
age of 18 years. 
2. Jane Doe's Mother brings this action individually and as parent and natural guardian of 
Jane Doe No. 1. Jane Doe's Mother is a citizen and resident of the State of Georgia. 

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 5-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2008   Page 3 of 7
3. This Complaint is brought under fictitious names to protect the identity of the Minor 
Plaintiff because this Complaint makes sensitive allegations of sexual assault and abuse 
upon a minor. 
4. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State ofNew York. 
5. This is an action for damages in excess of Fifty Million ($50,000,000.00) Dollars. 
Factual Allegations 
6. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 years old. 
Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains 
his principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and 
Palm Beach, FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate 
in Palm Beach. 
7. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for underage 
minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then 
gave them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and 
became one of his victims. 
8. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted girls in 
Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
9. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach Community 
College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a wealthy 
man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's plan, 
Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach 
residence or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. 
Page 2 of 6 

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 5-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2008   Page 4 of 7
Robson to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information 
and belief, generally sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from 
Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered -
generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and who were perceived as less likely to 
complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This 
was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
I 0. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at Epstein's 
mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who 
gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. 
Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage 
table in addition to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the 
stairway hall and in the bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, 
whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay 
down naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would 
perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation and touching 
the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
11. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to give 
Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's 
mansion in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of 
stairs to the room with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived 
wearing only a towel. He removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. 
He demanded that Jane remove her clothes. 
In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane 
complied, removing her clothes except for her underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted 
Jane. 
Page 3 of 6 

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 5-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2008   Page 5 of 7
12. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again 
who brought Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by 
Epstein for bringing Jane to him. 
13. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced confusion, 
shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. 
COUNTI 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
14. Intervenor-Plaintiff JANE DOE's MOTHER repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 
above. 
15. Epstein's conduct was intentional or reckless. 
16. Epstein's conduct was outrageous, going beyond all bounds of decency. 
17. Epstein's conduct caused severe emotional distress not only to Jane Doe, but also to her 
parents, including Jane Doe's Mother. Epstein knew or had reason to know that his 
intentional and outrageous conduct would cause emotional trauma and damage to Jane 
Doe's parents. 
18. As a direct and proximate result of Epstein's intentional or reckless conduct, Jane Doe's 
Mother has suffered and will continue to suffer severe mental anguish and pain. 
WHEREFORE, Intervenor-Plaintiff Jane Doe's Mother demands judgment against 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein for compensatory damages, costs, punitive damages, and such other 
and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 5-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2008   Page 6 of 7
COUNT II 
Loss of Parental Consortium 
19. Plaintiff Jane Doe's Mother repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 above. 
20. Epstein's tortious conduct is the direct and proximate cause of damages to Jane Doe's 
Mother, consisting of parental loss of comfort, companionship and society and healthcare 
costs associated with the treatment of Jane. 
21. Jane Doe's Mother experienced and will continue to experience great mental anguish, 
pain and suffering from the time that Defendant's tortious conduct occurred. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe's Mother demands judgment for loss of consortium, 
damages, costs and such other and further relief as this Court deems proper.

Intervenor-Plaintiff demands a jury trial in this action.

guardian, and JANE DOE's FATHER, and 
JANE DOE's STEPMOTHER, individually, 
Plaintiffs, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
----------------------'/ 
MOTION TO INTERVENE AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Applicant, JANE DOE'S MOTHER, individually and as parent and natural guardian of 
JANE DOE NO. 1, by and through the undersigned counsel, moves this Court, pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b ), for leave to intervene as a plaintiff in this action in order 
to assert the claims against Defendant JEFFREY EPSTEIN set forth in Applicant's proposed 
complaint (attached hereto as EXHIBIT "A''). In support of this motion, Applicant states that: 
1. Applicant has claims that share common questions of law or fact with the main action. 
2. Applicant's motion to intervene is timely. 
3. The original parties to this action will not be prejudiced by the intervention of Applicant. 
4. Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1.A.3, counsel for Applicant, in a good faith attempt to resolve 
this dispute, made a reasonable effort to confer with all parties who may be affected by 

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2008   Page 2 of 3
her intervention in this action. Counsel for Applicant conferred with Counsel for JANE 
DOE'S FATHER, who do not agree to her intervention in this action. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
"' 
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(l)(B), "[o]n timely motion, the court may 
permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a 
common question of law or fact." "Rule 24(b) should be liberally construed. 'Basically, anyone 
may be permitted to intervene if his claim and the main action have a common question of law or 
fact,' unless the court in its 'sound discretion (determines that) the intervention will unduly delay 
or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties."' Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish 
School Bd., 298 F. Supp. 288, 292-93 (D.C. La. 1969) (quoting Allen v. County School Board of 
Prince Edward County, 28 F.R.D. 358,363 (E.D. Va. 1961)) (citation and footnote omitted). 
Applicant, JANE DOE'S MOTHER, is the parent and natural guardian of JANE DOE 
NO. 1. As demonstrated in the attached proposed complaint, Applicant has claims for the same 
causes of action as JANE DOE'S FATHER. Therefore, her claims share common questions of 
law and fact with the main action. Applicant's motion to intervene is timely because it has been 
filed within days of the filing of the initial complaint in this action. And, because this action has 
just been initiated, permitting Applicant to intervene at this stage will not unduly delay the 
proceedings or prejudice the original parties.

grant her motion to intervene and accept the attached proposed Intervenor's Complaint as filed.

TO MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS PENDING  
JANE DOE NO. 1 REACHING AGE OF MAJORITY 
Plaintiffs, Jane Doe No. 1, by and through Jane Doe’s Father as parent and natural guardian, 
and Jane Doe’s Father and Jane Doe’s Stepmother, individually, submit this Memorandum of Law in 
Opposition to Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Jane Doe No. 1 Reaching Age of Majority, as 
follows:  
I. 
Introduction 
This action alleges the sexual assault of  Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 1 (“Jane Doe”) by the 
Defendant when she was 14 years old.  The Motion to Stay Proceedings filed by Jane Doe’s Mother 
is without basis and should be stricken or denied for the following reasons: 
1. 
It fails to include or be accompanied by a memorandum of law, in violation of 
S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1(A)(1).  This failure is particularly glaring here, as there is no obvious or apparent 
legal basis for the stay sought by Jane Doe’s Mother, and in preparing this Memorandum of Law in 
Opposition, Plaintiff is left to guess at the authorities relied upon by Jane Doe’s Mother.  
Herman & Mermelstein, P. A.                                                                              www.hermanlaw.com

2. 
The Motion to Stay was not served on all parties as shown on the Motion’s Certificate 
of Service.  Only Plaintiff’s counsel was served with the Motion.   As a result, notice of the relief 
sought by Jane Doe’s Mother is fatally defective.  
3. 
Jane Doe’s Father, by Court Order, was awarded full custody of the Minor Plaintiff, 
and is thus her sole natural guardian.  Jane Doe’s Mother is not Jane Doe’s natural guardian under 
Florida law, and thus has no standing to seek a stay of this action on behalf of Jane Doe.  
4. 
A stay would serve no constructive purpose or function in this litigation, but would 
only unnecessarily delay this case.  
Based on any or all of the foregoing grounds, as further discussed below, the Motion to Stay 
should be denied.  
II. 
Argument 
THE MOTION TO STAY IS PROCEDURALLY  
AND SUBSTANTIVELY DEFECTIVE 
A. 
The Motion to Stay Violates the Local Rules  
and Was Served Without Sufficient Notice 
Under S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1(A)(1), “[e]very motion when filed shall include or be accompanied 
by a memorandum of law citing supporting authorities. . . .”1  No such memorandum of law was 
filed with the Motion to Stay.  Plaintiff is prejudiced by this omission because he has had no notice 
of what authorities  Jane Doe’s Mother relies upon for the relief sought in her Motion.  As a result, 
the Motion to Stay is defective and should be stricken.  
The Motion to Stay also raises due process concerns because it was not served on all parties  
according to the Certificate of Service accompanying the Motion.  The Defendant has not yet filed 
an appearance in the case, and his response to the Complaint is not yet due.  The Motion to Stay is 
The stated exceptions to Rule 7.1(A)(1) are inapplicable here. 
Herman & Mermelstein, P. A.                                                                              www.hermanlaw.com

therefore premature and defective for lack of notice.  
B. 
Jane Doe’s Mother is Not Jane Doe’s Natural Guardian, and  
Therefore Has No Standing to Seek a Stay on Her Behalf 
The Motion to Stay and supporting Affidavit of Jane Doe’s Mother contain the following 
false and misleading statements:  
a. “Jane Doe No. 1 is a minor child . . . who is under the joint 
control of her parents and natural guardians, Jane Doe’s Father 
and Jane Doe’s Mother, who are divorced.”  (Motion to Stay 
Proceedings, ¶ 1) (emphasis supplied).  
b. “I am the mother and natural guardian for Jane Doe No. 1. . . .”  
(Affidavit of Dawn LaVogue Sandberg, Exh. “A” to Motion to Stay, 
¶ 1) (emphasis supplied).  
Jane Doe’s Mother does not have “joint control” or legal custody of Jane Doe, and is not her 
natural guardian under Florida law.  Jane Doe’s Mother and Jane Doe’s Father entered into a 
Custodial Parent Modification dated March 28, 2006.  This Modification was granted by Court 
Order dated April 25, 2006.  (A copy of the Custodial Parent Modification and the Order Granting 
Custodial Parent Modification are attached hereto as Composite Exhibit “A”).2  The Custodial 
Parent Modification states as follows: “Full Parental Custody of both minor children shall be 
granted to former husband [Jane Does’ Father].” (Custodial Parent Modification, ¶ 3) (emphasis 
supplied). 
Under Florida statutory law, in the case of a dissolved marriage, only the parent awarded 
custody can be the natural guardian of the minor child: “If the marriage between the parents is 
dissolved, the natural guardianship belongs to the parent to whom custody of the child is 
awarded.”  §744.301(1), Fla. Stat. (emphasis supplied).  It is therefore abundantly clear that Jane 
The names of Jane Doe and Jane Doe’s Father are redacted from Exhibit “A” hereto to protect the 
Minor Plaintiff’s anonymity. (See Complaint ¶ 4).  
Herman & Mermelstein, P. A.                                                                              www.hermanlaw.com

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 7   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/13/2008   Page 3 of 5

Doe’s Father, as the custodial parent, is the natural guardian, and the only natural guardian, of Jane 
Doe.  As the natural guardian, Jane Doe’s Father may sue on behalf of Jane Doe.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 
17(b) (providing that capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which 
the district court is held).  Because Jane Doe’s Father, as her natural guardian, represents her 
interests in this lawsuit, there is no legal basis for Jane Doe’s Mother to assert the right to represent 
Jane Doe. Jane Doe’s Mother lacks standing to seek a stay or other relief from this Court on behalf 
of Jane Doe. 
C. 
There Is No Legal Basis for a Stay 
A stay of proceedings may be appropriate in a situation where it will avoid piecemeal 
litigation, conserve judicial resources, aid in the comprehensive disposition of the litigation, or serve 
as a means of controlling the district court’s docket.  See American Manufacturers Mutual Ins. Co. 
v. Edward D. Stone Jr. & Assoc., 743 F.2d 1519 (11th Cir. 1984).  For example, a stay may be 
considered in a case where there is another pending lawsuit or administrative proceeding addressing 
the identical issues.  See Ortega Trujillo v. Conver & Co. Communications, Inc., 225 F.3d 1262 
(11th Cir. 2000).  Even then, a case in federal court should not be stayed absent “exceptional 
circumstances.”  American Manufacturers, 743 F.2d at 1524-1525.  Here, the only conceivable 
purpose that would be served by a stay is delay, which would be to Jane Doe’s prejudice.  A stay 
would not be in the interests of judicial economy and efficiency, and would not aid in a resolution of 
this litigation.  Because there is no legitimate argument for a stay in this case, the Motion should be 
denied.

III. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Motion to Stay is defective, deficient and meritless.  Denial of 
the Motion is appropriate on multiple, alternative grounds.  Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request 
that the Motion to Stay be denied.
