THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Civil Action No. ----
CASE NO: 
C.L., 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
------------------
COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, C.L., brings this Complaint against defendant, Jeffery Epstein ("Defendant"), 
and states as follows: 
PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE 
l. At all times material to this cause of action, Plaintiff was a resident of Palm Beach 
County, Florida. 
2. This Complaint is brought under a fictitious name to protect the identity of Plaintiff 
because this Complaint makes sensitive allegations of sexual assault and abuse of a then 
mmor. 
3. At all times material to this cause of action, Defendant owned a residence located at 358 
El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida. 
4. Defendant is presently a citizen of the United States Virgin Islands. Pursuant to the plea 
agreement entered by the Defendant in state court and the sentence which occurred on 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010   Page 2 of 12
June 30, 2008, Defendant is currently under community control in Palm Beach County, 
Florida. 
5. Defendant is an adult male born on January 20, 1953. 
6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 18 
u.s.c. § 2255. 
7. This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as a substantial part 
of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
STATEMENT OF THE FACTS 
8. At all relevant times, Defendant was an adult male spanning the ages of 45 and 55 years 
old. Defendant is known as a billionaire financier and money manager with a secret 
clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power, 
and influence. He owns a fleet of aircrafts that include a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and 
a Boeing 727, as well as a fleet of motor vehicles. Until his incarceration pursuant to the 
plea entered and sentencing, which occurred on June 30, 2008, he maintained his 
principal place of residence in the largest dwelling in Manhattan, a 51,000-square-foot 
eight-story mansion on the Upper East Side. He also owns a $6.8 million mansion in 
Palm Beach, Florida, a $30 million 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico he named "Zorro," a 
70-acre private island known as Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a mansion in 
London's Westminster neighborhood, and another residence in the Avenue Foch area of 
Paris. The allegations herein concern Defendant's conduct while at his lavish residence in 
Palm Beach and numerous other locations both nationally and internationally. 
9. Defendant has a sexual preference for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan, 
scheme, or enterprise in which he gained access to countless vulnerable and relatively 
Page 2 of 12 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010   Page 3 of 12
economically disadvantaged minor girls, and sexually assaulted, molested, and/or 
exploited these girls, and then gave them money. 
10. Beginning in or around 1998 through in or around September 2007, Defendant used his 
resources and his influence over vulnerable minor girls to engage in a systematic pattern 
of sexually exploitative behavior. 
11. Defendant's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Defendant 
coerced and enticed impressionable, vulnerable, and relatively economically less 
fortunate minor girls to participate in various acts of sexual misconduct that he 
committed upon them. Defendant's scheme involved the use of underage girls, as well as 
other individuals, to recruit underage girls. Defendant and/or an authorized agent would 
call and alert Defendant's assistants shortly before or after he arrived at his Palm Beach 
residence. His assistants would call economically disadvantaged and underage girls from 
West Palm Beach and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being 
offered and who Defendant and/or his assistants perceived as less likely to complain to 
authorities or have credibility issues if allegations of improper conduct were made. The 
) 
' 
then minor Plaintiff and other minor girls, some as young as 14 years old, were 
transported to Defendant's Palm Beach mansion by Defendant's employees, agents, 
and/or assistants in order to provide Defendant with "massages." 
12. Many of the instances of illegal sexual conduct committed by Defendant were perpetrated 
with the assistance, support, and facilitation of at least three assistants who helped him 
orchestrate this child exploitation enterprise. These assistants would arrange times for 
underage girls to come to Defendant's residence, transport or cause the transportation of 
underage girls to Defendant's residence, escort the underage girls to the massage room 
Page 3 of 12 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010   Page 4 of 12
where Defendant would be waiting or would enter shortly thereafter, urge the underage 
girls to remove their clothes, deliver cash from Defendant to the underage girls and/or 
their procurers at the conclusion of each "massage appointment," and assist Defendant in 
taking nude photographs and/or videos of the underage girls with and/or without their 
knowledge. Defendant would pay the procurer of each girl's "appointment" hundreds of 
dollars. 1 
13. Defendant designed this scheme to secure a private place in Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion where only persons employed and invited by Defendant would be present, so as 
to reduce the chance of detection of Defendant's sexual abuse and/or exploitation, as well 
as to make it more difficult for the minor girls to flee the premises and/or to credibly 
report his actions to law enforcement or other authorities. The girls were usually 
transported by his employee(s), agen'.t(s), and/or assistant(s) and/or by taxicab(s) and/or 
motor vehicle(s) paid for by Defendant, which also made it difficult for the girls to flee 
his mansion. 
14. Upon her initial arrival at Defendant's Palm Beach mansion, each underage victim would 
generally be introduced to one of Defendant's assistants, who would gather the girl's 
personal contact information. The minor girl w<;mld be led up a remote flight of stairs to a 
room that contained a massage table and a large shower. 
15. At times, if it was the girl's first "massage" appointment, another female would be in the 
room to "lyad the way." Generally the other female would leave, or Defendant would 
dismiss her. Often, Defendant would start his massage wearing only a small towel, which 
eventually would be removed. Defendant and/or the other female would direct the girl to 
massage him, giving the minor girl specific instructions as to where and how he wanted 
Page 4 of 12' 
\ 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010   Page 5 of 12
to be touched, and then direct her to remove her clothing. Defendant would then perform 
one or more lewd, lascivious, and sexual acts, including masturbation; fondling the 
minor's breasts and/or sexual organs; touching the minor's vulva, vagina, and/or anus 
with a vibrator, back massager, his finger(s), and/or his penis; digitally penetrating her 
vagina; performing intercourse, oral sex, and/or anal sex; and/or coercing or attempting to 
coerce the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or prostitution and/or enticing the then minor 
girls to engage in sexual acts with another female in Defendant's presence. The exact 
degree of the molestation and frequency with which the sexual exploitations took placed 
, varied and is not yet completely known; however, Defendant committed such acts 
regularly on a daily basis and, in most instances, severalrtimes a day. In order to facilitate 
the daily exchanges of money for sexual assault and abuse, Defendant kept U.S. currency 
readily available. 
16. Defendant was particularly skillful at discerning his minor victims' respective hopes, 
dreams, and ambitions. As he did with many of his victims, Defendant and his associates 
lured Plaintiff early-on with modeling opportunities, impressing her with his modeling 
business and contacts with supermodels, indicating that they could help her with a 
modeling career. 
17. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Defendant used his money, wealth and 
power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then minor Plaintiff. 
18. Plaintiff originally was introduced to Defendant whim-she was fifteen (15}years old. She 
was approached by a friend of hers in High School, who was also a victim of Epstein's 
scheme. 
Page 5 of 12 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010   Page 6 of 12
19. Plaintiff was originally told that she would be going to Defendant's home to for a 
potential modeling job. Plaintiff went to Defendant's Palm Beach mansion accompanied 
by this other victim of Defendant. Upon arriving, Plaintiff~as led up a flight of stairs to 
a room with a shower and a massage table. Defendant entered the room, instructed 
Plaintiff to massage him and proceeded to sexually molest the then minor Plaintiff. 
20. While confined in the bathroom with Defendant, Plaintiff was told by Defendant to 
undress. Plaintiff was then told to massage Defendant while he lay there naked, but for a 
small hand towel over his genitals. 
21. During this nude massage, Defendant touched Plaintiffs breasts and stroked her vagina 
with his fingers. Defendant masturbated during this naked massage while touching her 
vagina. 
22. Defendant then ejaculated into a towel. He then paid minor Plaintiff two hundred dollars, 
and Plaintiff was escorted out of Defendant's mansion and left Defendant's property. 
23. After this incident Defendant threatened Plaintiff "that if she told anyone what happened 
at his house bad things could happen." 
24. Over the course of the next several weeks a similar pattern of grooming continued and 
the sexual exploitation progressively escalated. One ofDefendant's associations, Sarah 
Kellen, approached the then minor Plaintiff. 
While at the mansion Sarah Kellen led the 
minor Plaintiff upstairs to Defendant's shower and massage room. Plaintiff was 
instructed to massage Defendant. While Sarah Kellen was initially present she soon left 
the then minor Plaintiff with the Defendant. Alone with the minor Plaintiff the 
Defendant seized upon this opportunity to persuade Plaintiff to take off her shirt. Once 
Defendant was able to exert influence over this minor Plaintiff he escalated his sexual 
I

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010   Page 7 of 12
( 
exploitation, Without Plaintiffs consent the Defendant fondled her body parts including 
) 
her vagina and breasts. Defendant proceeded to abuse the then minor Plaintiff with a 
vibrator, which he pushed onto her private parts. Defendant then penetrated the then 
minor Plaintiffs vagina with his fingers. After Defendant completed his sexual battery 
he paid the then minor Plaintiff and threatened her against telling any person, including 
the police and her parents, of what had occurred. 
25. After abusing the minor Plaintiff the Defendant or his associates would call the minor 
Plaintiff at her home. If the then minor Plaintiff did not answer the Defendant would take 
steps to find out where she was.· Throughout the length and past the physical conclusion 
of Defendant's sexual exploitation of minor Plaintiff the Defendant and/or his associates 
.would incessantly call Plaintiff. During some of these phone calls the Defendant or his 
associates would harass Plaintiff to recruit other minor girls threatening Plaintiff she 
would be in trouble if she did not. 
. .In June 2008, after an investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department, the State 
Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's 
Office, Defendant entered pleas of" guilty" to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in 
violation ofFla. Stat. § 796.07, and one count of solicitation of a minor to engage in 
prostitution, in violation of Fla. Stat. § 796.03 in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit iµ Palm

December 7, 2007, respectively. In so doing, Defendant acknowledged that Plaintiff was 
one of his victims and agreed to the following provisions of the NPA: 
8. If any of the [acknowledged victims] elects to file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Epstein 
will not contest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein waives his right to contest liability 
and also waives his right to contest damages up to an amount agreed to between the identified 
individual and Epstein, so long as the identified individual eJects to proceed exclusively under 18 
U.S.C. §2255, and agrees to waive any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal 
or common law. 
10. Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. §2255, as set 
forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's signature on this agreement, nor its terms, nor any 
resulting waivers or settlements by Epstein are to be construed as admissions of evidence or 
evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waive of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any 
person, whether or not her name appears on the list provided by the United States ( emphasis 
added). 
28. Plaintiff was among the individuals identified by the United States Attorney's Office as 
victims of Defendant upon whose testimony it intended to base its federal prosecution of 
Defendant for his illegal conduct. Consequently, Defendant is estopped by his state Court 
plea and the Non-Prosecution Agreement in denying the acts alleged in this Complaint 
and must effectively admit liability to Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 104.

C.L., 
vs. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 10-80447-CIV 
Plaintiff, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
----------~/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR MORE DEFINITE 
STATEMENT & TO STRIKE, & TO DISMISS DIRECTED TO COUNT 
III OF PLAINTIFF C.L.'S COMPLAINT (D.E. 1, dated 3/31/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, files this Motion For More Definite Statement & Strike, and Motion to Dismiss 
Count III Directed To Plaintiff C.L.'s Complaint. Rule 12(b)(6), Rule 12(e) and (f), 
Fed.R.Civ.P. (2010); Local Gen. Rule 7.1 (S.D. Fla. 2009). 
In support of his motion, 
Defendant states: 
The Complaint attempts to allege 3 counts, all of which are purportedly brought 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 - Civil Remedies for Personal Injuries. Defendant seeks 
more definite statement of the precise time period during which the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN involving Plaintiff occurred, and seeks more definite statement as to C.L.'s 
date of birth so he can determine when she was no longer a minor. Plaintiffs complaint 
fails to state even these rudimentary facts. 
As discussed more fully below herein, when 
EPSTEIN's alleged conduct involving C.L. occurred determines what version of 18 
U.S.C. §2255 applies to this action. 
To be clear, Defendant recognizes that pursuant to the NPA (Non-Prosecution 
Agreement) he cannot challenge the standing of Plaintiff to bring an action exclusively 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 2 of 22
under 18 U.S.C. §2255 or raise certain defenses as long as the action is brought 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. §2255. In addition, EPSTEIN pursuant to the NPA does not 
contest this Court's jurisdiction and waives liability as required by paragraph 8 of the 
NPA as to a predicate act or acts under §2255. However, the NPA does not prevent 
Defendant from asserting what version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 applies for purposes of 
establishing a minimum statutory damage recovery and whether one of the three 
specified predicate acts which was enacted subsequent to the completion of the 
defendant's alleged offense conduct with allegedly injured the plaintiff can be applied in 
the face of constitutional ex post facto prohibitions to criminal offenses that were not in 
effect at the time of the conduct at issue. See footnote 1 herein regarding EPSTEIN' s 
obligation to honor the terms of the NP A. 
To the extent that the conduct alleged by Plaintiff occurred prior to July 27, 2006, 
Count III is subject to dismissal because the predicate act relied upon by Plaintiff for her 
claims did not come into effect until July 27, 2006. Defendant's attorneys are 100% 
certain that Plaintiff, in being required to assert basic pleading requirement of time for 
the alleged acts, will allege that the conduct took place prior to July 27, 2006. Defendant 
notes that through his undersigned counsel's review of The Town of Palm Beach Police 
Department file produced in discovery that C.L. was meeting with the police in 
December of2005; that C.L.'s date of birth is April of 1988 (thus 18 and not a minor as 
of the time of the enactment of the predicate offense upon which Count III is based); and 
that she claimed she was at Defendant's home in 2004. By the Court requiring that 
Plaintiff plead such allegations, Plaintiff will detennine that she has no cause of action in 
Count III as a matter of law. While this court obviously has not yet ruled on the Motion 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 3 of 22
for More Definite Statement, Defendant is presenting his argument to Count III knowing 
that Plaintiff can and should concede the missing elements of "time" and birth month and 
year in her response. 
Supporting Memorandum of Law 
Motion For More Definite Statement and To Strike, Rule 12(e) and (f), F.R.C.P. 
Plaintiff alleges that "beginning in or around 1998 through in or around 
September 2007, Defendant used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor 
girls to engage in a systematic pattern of sexually exploitative behavior." (Complaint, 
ill 0). C.L. further alleges that she "originally introduced to Defendant when she was 
fifteen (15) years old." (Id, ill8). There are no allegations in the Complaint as to 
Plaintiffs date of birth or as to the time period during which the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN involving C.L. occurred. Such allegations are critical as it determines what 
version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 applies to this action. As discussed more fully below herein, 
U.S.C. was amended, effective July 27, 2006. 
Defendant also seeks to strike and more definitely state ilil8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 
and 15, such that the allegations pertain to C.L. and not other alleged victims or what 
EPSTEIN's alleged conduct was with respect to other alleged victims. Such allegations 
are immaterial and impertinent as they are not related to Plaintiffs C.L.'s claim. Plaintiff 
should allege those facts that specifically pertain to her. Not until ill 6 does Plaintiff 
assert allegations pertaining to her and the conduct of Defendant directly involving her. 
What EPSTEIN may or may not have allegedly done with respect to other females does 
not affect Plaintiffs claim brought pursuant to §2255. 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 4 of 22
The same lawyers that represent Plaintiff C.L. also represent Plaintiff B.B. in 
action filed against EPSTEIN in state court - Case No. 502008CA0373 l 9XXXXMB AB, 
15th Judicial Circuit Court, in for Palm Beach County, State of Florida. It appears that 
Plaintiffs counsel carelessly used the B.B. complaint as a template for this action even 
though different causes of action are asserted therein. At one time, the B.B. action 
attempted to include a Florida RICO claim which has now been voluntarily dismissed; 
Plaintiffs counsel by including allegations as to other Plaintiffs and other alleged "girls" 
was attempting to improperly assert a RICO claim in B.B. 
(Such immaterial and 
impertinent allegations in the B.B. case are also the subject of a motion to strike). 
Reference to a scheme, pattern, and plan are immaterial and impertinent to C.L.'s claim. 
Plaintiff is not allowed to argue other alleged Plaintiffs cases. The C.L. action is brought 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. §2255. The allegations in ,r,r8-15 are not related to the 
elements of Plaintiffs §2255 claim and, thus, are required to be stricken and/or replead to 
more definitely state the alleged facts specific to C.L. 
Motion to Dismiss Count III 
Because EPSTEIN's conduct occurred prior to July 27, 2006, and 
Plaintiff is relying on a statutory predicate act that was not enacted until 
after Jul. 27, 2006, Count III is required to be dismissed. 1 
Plaintiff is relying on a criminal predicate act, 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g) that was not 
even in existence at the time of the alleged conduct by EPSTEIN directed to C.L. which 
would clearly violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As noted above, 
Defendant is certain that when Plaintiff is required to more definitely state her claim and 
EPSTEIN will fully honor his obligations as set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United 
States Attorney's Office; principally, as related to the claims made in this case by C.L., the obligations as 
set forth in paragraph 8 of that Agreement. In particular, EPSTEIN will not contest the allegation that he 
committed at least one predicate offense as alleged by C.L. 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 5 of 22
allege facts as to time and conduct/acts specific to her, the date of the acts alleged will be 
prior to July 27, 2006, and thus, Defendant will argue his position based on the fact that 
no alleged conduct by EPSTEIN involving C.L. occurred on or after July 27, 2006. 
Additionally and equally important, as of July 27, 2006, C.L. would be 18 and no longer 
a minor at the time 18 U.S.C. §2255A(g) was enacted. Plaintiff in her response can and 
should concede this issue. 
There is no language in the statute which suggests (g) is to apply retroactively. It 
is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's inquiry begins with the plain and 
unambiguous language of the statutory text. CBS, Inc. v. Prime Time 24 Venture, 245 
F.3d 1217 (11 th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Castroneves, 2009 WL 528251, *3 (S.D. Fla. 2009),

language or give some absurd or strained interpretation. As stated in CBS, Inc., supra at

Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2002)2, is entitled Civil remedy for personal injuries, and 
provides: 
(a) Any minor who is a victim ofa violation of section 224l(c), 2242, 2243, 
2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and 
who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any 
appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual 
damages such minor sustains and the cost of the suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as described in the preceding 
sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than 
$50,000 in value. 
(b) Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the 
complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues or 
in the case of a person under a legal disability, not later than three years 
after the disability. 
See endnote I hereto for statutory text as amended in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. Prior to the 2006 amendments, the version of the statute quoted above was in 
effect beginning in 1999. 1 
The amended version of §2255 significantly changed 
subsection (a) such that it now reads -
(a) In general.--Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a 
violation of section 224l(c). 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 
2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as 
a result of such violation, regardless of whether the injury occurred 
while such person was a minor, may sue in any appropriate United 
States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such person 
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. 
Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to 
have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value. 
(Emphasis added to highlight the changes to the statute effective July 27, 2006). 
In Count III of her Complaint, she alleges that Defendant "knowingly engaged in a 
child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g)(2), in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §2252A(g)(l)." §2252A is one of the specified criminal predicate acts under 18 
The above quoted version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 was the same beginning in 1999 until amended in 2006, 
effective July 27, 2006. 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 7 of 22
U.S.C. §2255. However, subsection (g) of §2252 was not added to §2252 until July, 
2006. In attempting to assert a claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff is relying on 
subsection, (g)(l) and (2), of the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. §2252A as the requisite 
predicate act. Subsection (g) of §2252A was enacted in 2006, effective July 27, 2006. 
See 2006 Amendments; Pub.L. 109-248, § 701, added subsec. (g). 18 U.S.C.A. § 2252A. 
If the alleged conduct by EPSTEIN directed to C.L. occurred prior to the effective date of 
the statute, reliance on subsection (g) violates the well entrenched constitutional 
principles against retroactivity, and, thus, Count III is required to be dismissed. If the 
acts occurred only after July 27, 2006 (which Defendant's attorney know cannot be true), 
C.L. would be 18 and not a minor, so the statute would have no application. 
Pre-July, 2006, 18 U.S.C. §2252A contained no subsection (g) as relied on by 
Plaintiff.2 See endnote 2 hereto for complete statutory text of 18 U.S.C. §2252A (2004), 
and as amended effective, July 26, 2006. Subsection (g) which did not exist at the time 
of Defendant's alleged conduct now criminalizes the following conduct-
(g) Child exploitation enterprises.-
( 1) Whoever engages in a child exploitation enterprise shall be fined under this 
title and imprisoned for any term of years not less than 20 or for life. 
(2) A person engages in a child exploitation enterprise for the purposes of this 
section if the person violates section 1591, section 1201 if the victim is a minor, 
or chapter 109A (involving a minor victim), 110 (except for sections 2257 and 
2257 A), or 117 (involving a minor victim), as a part of a series of felony 
violations constituting three or more separate incidents and involving more than 
one victim, and commits those offenses in concert with three or more other 
persons. 
See endnote 2 hereto. 
It is an axiom of law that "retroactivity is not favored in the law." Bowen, 488 U.S., 
at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471 (1988). As eloquently stated in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 
114 S.Ct. 1483, 1497, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994): 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 8 of 22
... the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. 
Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an 
opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; 
settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.FNIS For that reason, the 
"principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed 
under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and 
universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., 
concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial and 
artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence 
about the legal consequences of their actions. 
FN18. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 
1105, 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents 
problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective 
legislation, because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and 
upset settled transactions"); [Further citations omitted]. 
It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds 
expression in several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause 
flatly prohibits retroactive application of penal legislation.FNI 9 Article I, § 
I 0, cl. 1, prohibits States from passing another type of retroactive legislation, 
laws "impairing the Obligation of Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings 
Clause prevents the Legislature (and other govermnent actors) from depriving 
private persons of vested property rights except for a "public use" and upon 
payment of "just compensation." The prohibitions on "Bills of Attainder" in Art. 
I, §§ 9-10, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons and 
meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. 
Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 
(1965). The Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and 
repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification 
sufficient to validate a statute's prospective application under the Clause "may 
not suffice" to warrant its retroactive application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn 
Mining Co., 428 U.S. !, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). 
FN19. Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress 
(§ 9, cl. 3), the other to the States(§ 10, cl. 1). We have construed the Clauses 
as applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-
391, I L.Ed. 648 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). 
These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular 
concerns. The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled 
expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity 
to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive 
legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals. As 
Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for * * 1498 the Court in Weaver v. 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 9 of 22
Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981), the Ex Post Facto 
Clause not only ensures that individuals have "fair warning" about the effect of 
criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by restraining arbitrary 
and potentially vindictive legislation." Id., at 28-29, 101 S.Ct., at 963-964 
( citations omitted). FN20 
FN20. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 513-514, 109 S.Ct. 
706, 732, I 02 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking 
bodies that promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional 
prohibitions against the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder 
reflect a valid concern about the use of the political process to punish or 
characterize past conduct of private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather 
than the legislative process, that is best equipped to identify past wrongdoers 
and to fashion remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would 
have existed had no wrong been committed") (STEVENS, J., concurring in 
part and concurring in judgment); James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213,247, 
n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) (retroactive punitive 
measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally 
but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or classes of 
persons"). 
These well entrenched constitutional protections and presumptions against 
retroactive application of legislation establish that 18 U.S.C. §2252A in effect at the time 
of the alleged conduct apply to the instant action, not the amended version which added 
subsection (g). 
Not only is there no clear express intent stating that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, but even if there were such an intent (which does not exist), applying a 
later version of the statute would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the 
United States Constitution as it would be applied to events occurring before its enactment 
and would increase the penalty or punishment for the alleged crime. U.S. Const. Art. 1, 
§9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1. U.S. v. Seigel, 153 F.3d 1256(11 th Cir. 1998); U.S. v. Edwards, 162 
F.3d 87 (3d Cir. 1998); and generally, Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390, I L.Ed. 648, 1798 
WL 587 (Calder) (1798). 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 10 of 22
The United States Constitution provides that "[n]o Bill of Attainder or ex 
post facto Law shall be passed" by Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3. A law 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it" 'appli[es] to events occurring before 
its enactment ... [and] disadvantage[s] the offender affected by it' by 
altering the definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for 
the crime." Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 
(1997) (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 
(1981)). 
U.S. v. Siegel,153 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11 th Cir. 1998). (Empasis added to above 
quotations). 
The statute, as amended in 2006, contains no language stating that the application 
of subsection (g) is to be retroactive. Thus, there is no manifest intent that the statute is 
to apply retroactively, and, accordingly, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged 
conduct is to apply. Landgrafv. USI Film Products, supra, at 1493, ("A statement that a 
statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has 
any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."). Here the statute, by adding 
subsection (g), clearly alters the definition of the criminal conduct. 
The cases of U.S. v. Siegel, supra (11 th Cir. 1998), and U.S. v. Edwards, supra (3d 
Cir. 1998), support Defendant's position that application of the current version of 18 
U.S.C. §2252A would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Siegel, the 
Eleventh Circuit found that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred application of the Mandatory 
Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MYRA) to the defendant whose criminal conduct 
occurred before the effective date of the statute, 18 U.S.C. §3664(f)(l)(A), even though 
the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding occurred after the effective date of the statute. 
On July 19, 1996, the defendant Siegel pleaded guilty to various charges under 18 U.S.C. 
§371 and §1956(a)(l)(A), (conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, and 
laundering of money instruments; and money laundering). He was sentenced on March 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 11 of 22
7, 1997. As part of his sentence, Siegel was ordered to pay $1,207,000.00 in restitution 
under the MYRA which became effective on April 24, 1996. Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 
Stat. 1214, 1229-1236. The 1996 amendments to MYRA required that the district court 
must order restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss without consideration of the 
defendant's ability to pay. Prior to the enactment of the MVRA and under the former 18 
U.S.C. §3664(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), Pub.I. No. 
97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, the court was required to consider, among other factors, the 
defendant's ability to pay in determining the amount of restitution. 
When the MYRA was enacted in 1996, Congress stated that the amendments to the 
VWP A "shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing 
proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment 
of this Act [Apr. 24, 1996]." Siegel, supra at 1258. The alleged crimes occurred between 
February, 1988 to May, 1990. The Court agreed with the defendant's position that 1996 
MVRA "should not be applied in reviewing the validity of the court's restitution order 
because to do so would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States 
Constitution. See U.S. Const. art I, §9, cl. 3." 
In resolving the issue in favor of the defendant, the Court first considered whether 
a restitution order is a punishment. Id, at 1259. In determining that restitution was a 
punishment, the Court noted that §3663A(a)(l) of Title 18 expressly describes restitution 
as a "penalty." In addition, the Court also noted that "[a]lthough not in the context of an 
ex post facto determination, . . . restitution is a 'criminal penalty meant to have strong 
deterrent and rehabilitative effect.' United States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 1493 n. 12 
(11th Cir.1997)." Second, the Court considered "whether the imposition of restitution 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 12 of 22
under the MYRA is an increased penalty as prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause." Id, 
at 1259. In determining that the application of the 1996 MYRA would indeed run afoul 
of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court agreed with the majority of the 
Circuits that restitution under the 1996 MYRA was an increased penalty.3 "The effect of 
the MYRA can be detrimental to a defendant. Previously, after considering the 
defendant's financial condition, the court had the discretion to order restitution in an 
amount less than the loss sustained by the victim. Under the MYRA, however, the court 
must order restitution to each victim in the full amount." Id, at 1260. See also U.S. v. 
Edwards, 162 F.2d 87 (3rd Circuit 1998). 
Based on these principles barring retroactive application, Defendant is entitled to 
a determination that the statute in effect at the time of the alleged criminal conduct 
applies and, thus, Count III is subject to dismissal. The statute now criminalizes conduct 
not previously so criminalized. 
As further explained by the Landgraf court, supra at 280, and at 1505,4 
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the 
court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the 
statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to 
resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such 
express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have 
retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he 
acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with 
respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate 
The Eleventh Circuit, in holding that "the MYRA cannot be applied to a person whose criminal conduct 
occurred prior to April 24, 1996," was "persuaded by the majority of districts on this issue." "Restitution is 
a criminal penalty carrying with it characteristics of criminal punishment." Siegel, supra at 1260. The 
Eleventh Circuit is in agreement with the Second, Third, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits. See U.S. v. 
Futrell, 209 F.3d 1286, 1289-90 (ll"' Cir. 2000). 
In Landgraf, the United States Supreme Court affinned the judgment of the Court of Appeals 
and refused to apply new provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to conduct occurring before 
the effective date of the Act. The Court determined that statutory text in question, § I 02, was 
subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity. 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 13 of 22
retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent 
clear congressional intent favoring such a result. 
Even though C.L. has invoked the provisions of the criminal NP A between 
EPSTEIN and USAO (see paragraphs 27 and 28 of Complaint), it does not mean that 
Plaintiff can avoid application of the well established constitutional protections discussed 
herein (as well as other constitutional protections and principles, including but not limited 
to the rule of lenity and due process) and which EPSTEIN is entitled to assert so long as 
the assertions do not conflict with his obligations to neither contest jurisdiction nor 
liability as set forth in paragraph 8 of the NP A. 
Thus, Count III should be dismissed to the extent it relies on conduct that occurred 
prior to July 27, 2006, and relies on a criminal predicate act that did not come into 
existence until July 27, 2006, in violation of the constitutional prohibitions of 
retroacti vity. 
Conclusion 
Pursuant to the above, Count III is required to be dismissed. In addition, Plaintiff 
should be required to more definitely state the specific dates of the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN specifically involving her, and her date of birth. Any conduct occurring after 
her 18th birthday should be stricken, and ,r,rs - 15 of the Complaint should also be 
stricken and be replead to the extent that allegations specifically involve C.L. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Count III against him, 
and further grant his Motion for More Definite Statement and to Strike.

---~~----------' 
PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTEPSTEIN'S 
MOTION FORM ORE DEFINJTE STATEMENT.& TO STRIKE, & TO DISMISS 
DIRECTED TO COUNTIII OF PLAINTIFF C.L.'S COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, C. L., by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Response to 
Defendant Epstein's Motion For More Definite Statement & To Strike, & To Dismi.ss 
Directed To Count Ill Of Plaintiff C.L. 'S Complaint. ("Motion"). 
First, Defendant 
argues that Count III of Plaintiffs Complaint should be dismissed because the predicate 
' 
act relied upop, 1.8 U.S.C. § 2252 A(g), did not come into effect until July 27, 2006, well 
after Defendant's offensive conduct occurred. Defendant then seeks a more definite 
statement,. i. e;, for Plaintiff to allege her date of birth in order to establish when she 
reached 18, the age of majority under state and federal law. Finally, Defendant seeks to 
strike paragraphs 8 through 15 of Plaintiffs Complaint as immaterial and impertinent. 
Defendant's motion should be denied for the reasons set forth below: 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 2 of 13
I. 
Count III _Should Not Be Dismissed, As Retroactive.Application Of§ 2252 
A(G)(l) And (2) Does Not Violate Constitutional Ex Post Facto Prohibitions 
In moving to dismiss, Defendant focused on the issue of whether Plaintiff may 
bring the claim set forth in Count III of her Complaint in which she alleged that the 
Defendant knowingly engaged in a child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2252 A(g)(2), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252 A(g)(l). Section 2252 A is one of the 
specified predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, although subsection (g) ofthat statute 
. 
. • . 
-
was not enacted until 2006, after Defendant's offending conduct occurred. Defendant's 
argument is premised on the fact that Defendant molested the then minor-Plaintiff before 
subsection (g}ofthat statute was enacted. Defendant's argument must fail. The Ex Post 
Facto clause does not apply because the remedy afforded under Section 2255 and Section 
2252 A is a non--punitive civil remedy. 
The matter of whether these and other such amendments may be • applied 
retroactively is extremely relevant to Plaintiffs claims and the :remedies sought 
throughout her Complaint. Plaintiff and Defendant fundamentally disagree. as to the 
retroactive nature of 18 U.S.C. § 2255Aas well as the interpretation of whichever version 
of §2255 the Couttadopts. The Court's decisions as to retroactive application of§ 2255 
ultimately will critically affect the results of claims brought by each and every one of 
-
·-
-
Defendant's many victims who are currently seeking redress under §2.255. Thus, its 
significance cdnnot be overemphasized. 
A. 
Background_ Of The 2006 • Amendment To The Statute 
• In 'July of 2006 substantial changes were made in Section 2255 and to some of 
its predicate icts as the result of the enactment of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and 
. 
. 
Safety Act of 2006 ("AW A"). One such measure in the A WA wasJhe Internet Saf~ty 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 3 of 13
Act, which wa_s codified in §2252 A(g), and outlawed child exploitation enterprises and 
set a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 20 years for those who act in concert to 
commit at least three separate violations of federal child pornography, sex trafficking, 'ot 
sexual abuse laws against multiple child victims. Another very important change brought 
. 
( 
• 
about by the A WA was Masha's Law1, which addressed child exploitation over the 
Internet. 
Sectioi1 2255 has been lauded as an additional remedy against those who sexually 
exploit or abuse children. Even though the 2006 Amendment provided formore penalties 
for child abusers, the pervasive tenor of the legislati()n was curative and remedial in 
nature. Throughout the Congressional Record of the enactment of the A WA2, the act is 
praised for its extraordinarily remedial quality. For. instance, Senator Bill Nelson and•. 
I 
others spoke of it as a bill to Safeguard children and allow law enforcement to help 
prevent other families from suffering tragedies siinilar to those the Walsh's, L~risford's. 
Ryce's and Masha had to endure. See Id. at S8021. Additionally, President Blish hailed it 
as giving law enforcement the tools needed to go after criminals who exploit childten.3 
On July 27, 2006, twenty-five .years after the tragic abduction of Adam Walsh, Congress enacted· 
"Masha's Law" .as a part of the AWA. 
Masha's ~aw, amended § 2255(a) to increase the statutory 
minimum damages to $150,000 and to expind the scope of potential Plaintiffs from "any minor" to "any 
person,who'.While a minor" was a victim ofa specified statute, i.e., one oftheptedicate acts listed in 2255, 
,J includirlg the ony. most relevant here, 2252 A Masha's Law was nam.ed after a 13-year-old Russian 
orphan1. who wa~ adopt7d by a Pennsylvania mall with a history of child.· exploitation. . He sexually 
assaulted heqmd posted ri11de photographs of the child all over1nternet pedophile web sites, which ,are still 
beingdownlmtded every day. SenatorJohn Kerry, one of the authors ofMasha's Law, in his r;em!lfk~. 011 the • 
• day oftheadoptionofthe AWA, highlighted the remedial nature._ofthe legislation, when he said_that it was· 
because of l\1ashcl)hcit C~mgress was finally closing unacceptable looph9les in our child exploitation laws. 
The specific intent of those involved.in developing this statutory scheme was. for girls similarly violated to 
be able to bring cau,ses of action as adults because of the continuing nature of such violations, Subsection

B. 
Defendant's Argument Is Wrong Because It Ignores The Fact That 
Tbe Ex Post FactOClause Is Inapplicable To A Non-Punitive Civil 
Remedy. 
Defendant's argument is rooted in his idea ~hat the application of 18 U.S.C. § 
2252 A(g)(2006)5 to Defendant's act would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the 
Constitution. The Plaintiff was sexually molested by • the Defendant before the 2006 
Amendment was enacted. According to Defendant applying subsection (g) "to events 
occurring before its enactment and would [illegally] increase the penalty or punishment 
for the alleged crime." Motion at 9. 
Defendant's argument must fail - the Ex Post Facto Clause only applies to 
( 
punitive remedies. Manocchino V; Kusserow, 961 F.2d 1539, 1541 (11th Cir. 1992) 
(citing Fleming v. Nestor, .363 U.S. 603, 613(1960)). As the Supreme Court of the State 
) 
of Florida stated "[ a] civil remedy that does not constitute criminal punishment does not 
violate ex post facto prohibitions." Griffin v. State, 980 So.2d 1035, 1Q37(Fla. 2008). 
~ 
"A statute is not punitive, for purposes of determining whether it violates the ex post , 
facto clause, merely because it can be applied in the context of a criminal case." Id. 
Plaintif rs case against Defendant is civil, not criminal. 
Defendant's • argument that 
applying subsection (g) would illegally increase the punishment for the alleged crime is 
. misplaced. Plaintiff is not and does not have the power to bring a criminal charge against 
.Defendant. 1n fact, Plaintiffs requested remedy under Section 2255 and byextensfoh 
Section 2252 A(g) is a none.punitive dvil remedy. 
2l_Justfoe. Stevens notes in Landgraf at 1487 that the presumption· against retroactivity finds its expression in 
the criminal context in the Ex Post Facto Clause. Section 2is2 A(g) alone does not pro~ide for punitive 
damages, although they ate provided for elsewhere in the 2006 version of the statute. Landgraf holds that 
as such it is 'c;:learly fobject to the presumption against retroactivity, since the very labels given 
"punitive" ... daniages, as well as the raticmales supporting them, demonstrate that they share, key 
• characteristics of criminal sanctions, and therefore would raise a serious question under the Ex Post Rricto • 
.,Clause if retroactively. imposed.' 
• 
•• • • 
' 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 5 of 13
Defendant's argument is premised on the general axiom that retroactivify is not 
favo~edinthe law. (Motion,at 7, citing Bowen v. Georgetown University. 488 U.S.204, 
208, 109 S, Ct, 468, 471 (D.C.Col.1988)). Quoting extensively from Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994), Defendant recited all· the concerns 
) 
underlying the historic presumption against retroactive legislation, one of whichis the 
constitutional prohibition of retroactive application of penal legislation. 4 Defendant's 
argument is ~orrectly rooted in the premise that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to 
. 
. 
punitive remedies. Unfortunately, Defendant next attempted to use criminal cases to 
improperly over-extend the Ex Post Facto Clause to the non-punitive civil remedy at 
hand. This improper extension should not stand. 
First, Defendant's argument relied heavily on the cases ofU;S. v. Siegel, 153 F. 
3d 1256(11th Cir. 1998) and U.S. v. Edwards, 162 F. 3d. 87 (3d. Cir. 1998). Both held 
the Ex Post Facto Clause barred the application of the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act 
(MVR,A) to defendants whose criminal. conduct occutted before the effective date of the 
statute. Defel}darit' s argument glossed over the key distinction between these cases and 
the matter at hand. In Defendant's cited cases the disputed remedy was punitive; i.e., it 
punished crimina{ activity. In the case at hand the remedy at· issue is a non-punitive civil 
remedy.

This deficiency in Defendant's argument is highl~ghted by Court's opinion in

. 
Edwards, which recognfaed the remedy· at issue in that case (i.e., restitution) was a 
criminalpenalty. Restitution is an integral and necessary part of sentencing, supervised 
~ U.S. Const. Art 1, § 9, cl.3. 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 6 of 13
• release, and probation.6 Edwards at 91. In reaching this decision the Edwards Court 
relied upon the legi~lative history of the MVRA which indicated mandatory restitutiqn 
should be considered a condition of a defendant's supervised release and probation. 
Tq.us, • the Court concluded that the -MVRA' s legislative history evinced a congressional 
intent to . . : . make mandatory restitution under the MVRA a penalty separate from civil 
i 
remedies available to victims of crime ... i.e., to ensure that restitution under the MVRA 
is a form of criminal penalty rather than civil redress. See Edwards 'at 91. Defendant's 
argument ignores the fact that while criminal restitution may resemble a civil remedy ti 
simply is nof a civil remedy. 
This is in stark contrast to Plaintiffs reliance on § 
2252A(g) in her ci;il case 'Yhich provides a civil remedy impose~_under the civil statute 
u.s.c § 2255. 
C. 
Section 2255's Remedy ls A Non-Punitive Civil Remedy 
Therernedy provided under Section 2255 and by extension Section 2252A(g) is a 
non-punitive·civil remedy. 
First, in Individual.Known to Defendant as 08MIS7o· 96.jpg v. Falso, 2009 WL 
4807537 (N.D. NY. Dec. 9, 2009),_ the Court analyzed the remedy provided under 
Section 22.55 and held it was clear the remedy was a civil ttjrnedy and was not criminally 
punitive. Id. As the Couit stated, "the Jact that the payment of damages might have.some 
. 
' 
deterrent effect is insufficient to categorize the statute as criminal. The statute serves 
civilgoals." 1d: 8 
§! 18 U.S. C. §§J556i 3563 (a)(b)(A), 3563 (b)(2), 356~, 3663A, 3664. 
&. Other decisions relating fo A WA agree that the legislation is civil and. remedial in nature and not 
violative of rules orstatut~s prohibiting retroactivity. See State v. Bodyke, 2008cOhio-6387 (qhio App; 6th 
Dist. 2008) _· ("[i]he more burdensome registration requirements and the. collection and dissemination of 
additional informatio~ about th~ offender are part of a remedial, regulatory sch~me; designed toprotect the 
public rather[thari] to punish the offender). Moreover, in State v. Honey, 2008-Ohio-4943 (Ohio App. 9th 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 7 of 13
Second, Plaintiffs argument Section 2255's remedy is a non-punitive civil 
remedy is supported by the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Manocchino v. Kusserow, 961 
F.2d 1542 (11 th Cir. 1992). In Manocchino, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed an ex-post 
facto challenge to a different statute. The Court stated that "since the legislative intent of 
[that] [statute] [was] to protect the public, the sanction [was] remedial, not punitive.'' 961 
F.2d at 1542. The Court held the remedy was not punitive despite clear indications the 
statute also served punitive goal of providing a deterrent against criminal action. Id. As 
the Mano~chino Court stated, the "legislative history, taken as a whole, demonstrate[d] 
that the primary goal of the legislation [was] to protect" the public. Id. 
Like the statute analyzed in Manocchino, the legislative history of Section 2255 
points to the fact that the remedy provided under Section 2255 and subsequently Section 
2252 is not punitive. First, the House report from Section 2255's original passage states 
that "[t]he bill also authorizes the pursuit of a civil remedy for personal injuries resulting 
from certain sex crimes against children." H.R. Rep. No. 105-557, at 11 (1998), reprinted 
in 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. 678, 679. Second, the "Background and Need for the Legislation" 
section demonstrates that the purpose of the legislation, including the remedy, was to 
protect children. The House reported that "the 'Child Protection and Sexual Predator 
Punishment Act of 1998,' [ was la response to requests of ... parents and law enforcement 
' 
' 
Dist. 2008) the Court explained, "A statute is 'substantive' if itimpairs or takes away vested rights, affects 
an accrued substantive right, imposes new or additional bwdens, duties, obligation, C>r liabilities as to a past 
transaction, or creates a new right. 
Conversely, remedial laws are those affecting only the remedy 
provided, and include laws that merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy' for the enforcement of 
an existing right.,,Jd. at 7. The court explains that "to withstand the Ex Post Facto Clause, a statute must be 
civil and nori-'punitive with regard to both the legislature's intent in enacting it and its actual effect upon 
enactment.Id at 6. The court rejects the claim that A WA violates the Constitutional prohibition against ex 
post facto laws because it is obviously intended to be civil and non-punitive in nature (id). Because publtc 
safety is the driving' force behind.A WA, the fact that the requirements of the act have .a significant impact 
upon the lives of sex offenders, does not offend Ohio's prohibition on retroactive laws. Id. at 5. But see, 
Basel v. McFarland & Sons, Inc., 815S0. 2d 687,692 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002) (even if legislature expressly 
provides for it, courts will refuse retroactive application if statute impairs vested rights, creates new 
obligations or imposes new penalties). 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 8 of 13
to address public safety issues involving the most vulnerable members of our society, our 
' 
children." Id. at 12. Accordingly, the legislative history of Section 2255 defuonstrates it 
• 
', 
was intended to protect the public and provide a civil remedy for victims of sexual abuse. 
Thus, just like the statute in Manocchino, the remedy provided under Section 2255 and 
by extension Section 22j2 while protective is not punitive. 
D. 
Conclusion 
As a whole, Defendant's argument is deficient because it ignores the fact that the 
Ex Post Facto Clause is only applicable to punitive remedies; Manocchino v. Kusserow, 
961 F.2d 1539, 1541 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Fleming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 
613(1960)). Defendant's reliance on Siegel and Edwards is misplaced. Those cases dealt 
with punitive criminal restitution. Section 2255 does not mandate payment of restitution, 
rather, it provides for a non-punitive civil remedy. 18 U.S.C .. § 2255 (2006); Individual 
Known to Defendant As 08MIST096.JPG and 08mist067.ipg v. Falso, No. 5:08-cd-917, 
slip op. at 2 (N.D. N.Y. Dec. 9, 2009) ("it is clear that the statutory intent was to provide 
a Civil remedy."). Just because civil recovery under Section 2255 is predicated on a 
criminal statute, does not mean that its remedy is punitive. Cf. Patel v. Thompson, 319 
F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir. 2003). The Defendant's over extension should not st8!1-d. The 
Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to the case at hand.

II. 
Defendant's Motion For A More Definite Statement Should Fail Becauseltls 
Inappropriate And Moot. 
Plaintiff acknowled~es that the date she reached majority has relevance to her§ 
2255 claims. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff does not object to providing her birth date to 
Defendant through appropriate discovery. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant caused her 
severe harm while she was a minor by actions constituting the violation of several 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 9 of 13
criminal predicate acts listed in § 2255. Whether or not certain of those specific acts may 
be found to have been committed after she reached the age of majority will be a factual 
issue that can be determined through discovery like other factual matters. Under no 
circumstances can Defendant contend that he did not violate one or more criminal 
predicate acts harming Plaintiff while she was a minor. Plaintiff has brought her claims 
anonymously as C.L. specifically to protect her privacy as a child victim. For the same 
reason she should not be required to publish her birth date in a pleading that is available 
'· 
to the public, as birth dates are but another Hnk in the chain to identification. In any case, 
since Plaintiff agrees to provide that information privately to the Defendant, his request 
that it be spedfically pled is moot. 
Plaintiffs Complaint without her date of birth satisfies Federat' pleading 
requirements. First, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)2 only requires, "a short and 
plain statement. of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief." Plaintiff stated she 
( 
, 
was a minor when Defendant sexually molested her - which is sufficient under FRCP 
8(a)(2). 
Second, Plaintiffs Complaint provides ample information to provide the 
Defendant fair notice as to the nature of her claims. The purpose of Federal Rule of Civil 
Proce.dure 8(a)2 is to provide the Defendant with fair notice of what claim is being 
alleged and the grounds upon which it rests. See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
Consol., 516 F3d 955, 974 (11 th Cir. 2008). From reading the Complaint the Defendant 
can certainly decipherthat the grounds for Plaintiffs claims rest upon Defendant's sexual 
molestation ofher when she was a minor. Moreover, the Complaint's factual allegations 
raise a right to relief that . is certainly more than speculative - in fact, the Defendant 
already pied guilty to molesting Plaintiff. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 US 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 10 of 13
544, 555 (2007) ("[£]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the 
speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true 
\ 
(even if dm.ibtful in fact)."). Finally, F~deral Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) requires 
I 
Plaintiff to provide Defendant a more definite statement only when the Complaint "is so 
vague and ambiguous that a [Defendant] cannot reasonably prepare a response." 
Defendant has enough information to prepare a response to Plaintiffs Complaint. To 
i 
quote Defendant's motion, '"Defendant's attorneys are 100% certain that Bfaintiff . . . will 
allege that the conduct took pl~ce prior to July 27, 2006." " ... C.L' s date of birth is April 
of 1988 ... and she claimed she was atDefendant's home in 2004;" (Motion at 2). 
Accordingly, Defendant's motion for a more definite statement must fail. It is 
illogical, unnecessary and has no basis in the law. The Plaintiff is not required to give the 
. 
~ 
Defendant more information than is legally necessary just because the Defendant d~sires 
that information for an Affirmative Defense. 
III. 
Defendant's Motion To StrikeJ>aragraphs 8 Through 15 Because They Don't 
Pertain Strictly To The Plaintiff Should Be Denied. 
It is no wonder that Defendant would Hke to· eliminate paragraphs 8 through 15. of 
Plaintiffs C0111plaint; however, his request should be summarily denied. These 
paragraphs are material and pertinent. They describe the child exploitation enterprise by 
which Defendant; in concert with at least thre.e assistants, lured countless young women 
to his lair oh exclusive Palm Beach; where he assaulted them and enticed them to perfotm 
lewd and lascivicms acts for his sexual gratification. 
TaJ<en paragraph l,y paragraph, these portions of Plaintiffs Complaint allege a 
systematic pattern of sexual exploitation of vulnerable minor girls by an oider man with . 
·-·---· vast resources'-and-influence. (110). As part of this plan, Defendant em.ployed agents to 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 11 of 13
call and transport to his residence economically disadvantaged and underage -girls, who 
were unlikely to complain to authorities or would have credibility issues if they did. (,r 
11). Atleast three assistants helped orchestrate Defendant's child exploitation enterprise 
by arranging appointments for massages, escorting the minor victims to the massage 
room, cajoling them to remove their clothes, delivering cash after each massage and/or 
procurement and assisting in taking nude photographs of these.minor victims. (,r 12). 
/ 
' 
The a
1ssistants helped secure a secluded place for these activities, making it more difficult 
for the child victims to flee or for the unlawful exploitation to be detected. 
(,r 13). 
Assistants woy.ld handle introductions and information gathering upon the girls' arrival 
before leading them upstairs. (,r 14). An assistant or procurer would "lead the way" 
instructing each new girl as to where and how Defendant liked to be touched during 
massage. She would then leave the minor girl alone with Defendant, who would expose 
himself, grope, fondle, digitally penetrate, apply a vibrator or coerce the girl into having 
intercourse witl:i him or to perform sexual acts with one of his female assistants~ all the 
wllile masturbating himself. 
(,r 15). Defendant traveled to and from his multiple 
international r7sidences, using the telephone to contact these minor girls and conspiring 
,· 
with his assistants to facilitate his child exploitation enterprise and avoid police detectipn. 
(,r 16). 
These were not isolated acts but a systematic, well developed plan. Defendant had 
a veritable Ponzi scheme by which he secured his young prey, paid them to lure other 
' 
• 
minor /Victims and then groomed the faithful among them to ·become more· and more 
involved with him sexually. In that way, these paragr1;1,phs do pertain to C.L. One must 
.• 
• 
I 
understand the system to perceive how Plaintiff was· drawn in, groomed, and thenabused 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 12 of 13
and molested in a slowly escalating fashion. This was indeed a child exploitation ) 
enterprise as described in §2252A. 
Nonetheless, Defendant only concludes that paragraphs 8 - 15 should be stricken . 
without citing any case and with minimal accompanying argument. Thus, this Court 
should see Defendant's request for what it really hL ~ a smoke screen in ah attempt to 
obscure the terrible facts which surrounded.Plaintiffs molestation. 
CONCLUSION 
Defendant failed to effectively argue that Count III of Plaintiff's claim should be 
dismissed. Application of Section 2255 and by extension Section 2252 to Defendant's 
acts does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Plaintiff's case is civil, not criminal. 
Those statutes provide for a non-punitive civil remedy, not criminal punishment. 
Defendant's request for a more definite statement must also fail because the Plaintiff 
sufficiently described her age to state a cause of action. Finally, Defendant failed to 
.provide any legalbasis as to why paragraphs ,8 -
should be stricken from the 
Complaint. As stated, those paragraphs are pertinent to the story of whyn Jeffrey Epstein 
molested the then minor Plaintiff. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that the Court deny all parts Defendant's Motion.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
C.L., 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
------------
JUN 1 4 2010 
STEVEN M. LARIMORE 
CLERK U.S. DIST. CT. 
S.D. OF FLA. -W.P.8. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion to 
Quash and Motion for Attorneys' Fees, With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN") by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion 
to Quash and Motion for Attorneys' fees and Costs, With Incorporated Memorandum Of 
Law. In support, Defendant states as follows: 
1. As this Court is well aware, these cases have been consolidated for discovery. 
However, on April 1, 2010, Plaintiffs counsel, Spencer Kuvin, filed C.L. v. Epstein, 
Case No. 10-80447-cv-Marra/Johnson, and that case has not been consolidated with the 
other related cases for purposes of discovery. 
2. On April 20, 2010, Mr. Kuvin served Maritza Milagros Vasquez with a subpoena 
for deposition, which is set to occur tomorrow. See Exhibit "A". However, this Notice 
and subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed as Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his 
client, has failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (d). That rule states, in pertinent part, 
that: "[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred 
as required by Rule 26(f) .... " Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has not complied with 
Rule 26(f) and, therefore, the subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed and a 
Protective Order should be entered pursuant to Rule 26( c) forbidding the deposition from 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 2 of 9
occurring for non-compliance with the applicable rules. In Varo, Inc. v. Litton Systems, 
Inc., 129 F.R.D. 139, 141 (N.D. TX 1989), the court held that one cannot be compelled to 
comply with a withdrawn subpoena. Id. Likewise, the court here cannot compel Maritza 
Milagros Vasquez to attend any deposition when the subpoena itself is invalid, especially 
when it will require those involved in these matters to incur substantial attorneys' fees. 
3. Next, Mr. Brad Edwards, counsel for Jane Doe, cross-noticed Maritza Milagros 
Vasquez's deposition in Jane Doe (#08-80893 - Exhibit "B"), which matter is already set 
for trial in July 2010. 
Discovery concluded on May 31, 2010 (see DE 531). 
Accordingly, the cross notice served by Jane Doe must be stricken/quashed and a 
protective order entered because the subpoena itself in invalid due to C.L.' s counsel's 
failure to comply with Rule 26(d) and discovery in Jane Doe (80893) has concluded. 
Rule 7.1 Certification 
I hereby certify that counsel for the respective parties communicated by e-mail in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues set forth above prior to the filing of this Motion and 
none of the issues were resolved. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an order granting 
Defendant's motion for protective order and motion to quash. Defendant further requests 
that this Court award his attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion, in 
accordance with Rule 37, Fed.R.Civ.P. and applicable Local Rules and specifically: 
a. Quash CL's subpoena attached as Exhibit "A"; 
b. Quash and/or strike Jane Doe's cross notice as to Exhibit "A" because 
Exhibit "A" is invalid and discovery has concluded in Jane Doe; 
c. Award attorneys to Defendant for CL and Jane Doe's noncompliance with 
these discovery matters; and 
d. for such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.
