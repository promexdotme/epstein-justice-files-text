Petitioner(s) 
Respondent(s) 
Upon review of the response to this Court's order to show cause dated May 
3, 2017, the Court has determined that it should decline to exercise jurisdiction in 
this case.  See Debrincat v. Fischer, 42 Fla. L. Weekly S141 (Fla. Feb. 9, 2017). 
The petition for discretionary review is, therefore, denied.  
No motion for rehearing will be entertained by the Court.  See Fla. R. App. 
P. 9.330(d)(2).

WARNER,J. 
Appellant challenges a summary judgment holding that his malicious 
prosecution claim against appellee Epstein was barred by the litigation 
privilege. The trial court granted summary judgment based upon Wolfe v. 
Foreman, 128 So. 3d 67 (Fla. 3d DCA 2013), which had decided this issue 
just before the motion for summary judgment was heard. 1 However, after 
the trial court ruled, our court held to the contrary in Fischer v. Debrincat, 
169 So. 3d 1204, 1209 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015), and certified conflict with 
Wolfe to the supreme court. See also Rivemider v. Meyer, 174 So. 3d 602, 
604 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015) (same). As the issue is the same in this case, we 
hold that the litigation privilege does not bar a malicious prosecution 
The trial court properly relied on Wolfe at the time, because that case was 
binding upon the trial court in the absence of interdistrict conflict. See Pardo v. 
State, 596 So. 2d 665, 666 (Fla. 1992). 

cause of action where all the elements of malicious prosecution are 
present. 
Epstein suggests that this case could be decided on a tipsy coachman 
analysis, as he alleges that all the elements of the cause of action were not 
present. However, the trial court specifically found that material issues of 
fact remained as to the elements of the claim. Based upon the facts 
presented and the inferences which may be drawn from those facts, we 
will not disturb the trial court's evaluation. 
Just as in Fi.scher and Rivemider, we certify that this opinion conflicts 
with Wolfe. 
Reversed and remanded for furlher proceedings.

analysis, as he alleges that all the elements of the cause of action were not 
present. However, the trial court specifically found that material issues of 
fact remained as to the elements of the claim. 
Based upon the facts 
presented and the inferences which may be drawn from those facts, we 
will not disturb the trial court's evaluation. 
Just as in Fischer and Rivemider, we certify that this opinion conflicts 
with Wolfe. 
Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

The jurisdiction of this Court was invoked by the filing of a Notice to Invoke

from the district court of appeal as required by Florida Rules of Appellate 
Procedure 9.110(b) and 9.120(b).  The filing fee is due and payable at the time of 
filing the notice.  Petitioner is allowed to and including January 11, 2016, in which 
to submit the filing fee, or an order of insolvency, or a proper motion for leave to 
proceed in forma pauperis that complies with sections 57.081 and 57.082, Florida 
Statutes (2013).  Failure to submit the filing fee or one of the above referenced 
documents to this Court could result in the imposition of sanctions, including 
dismissal of the notice. 
Please understand that once this case is dismissed, it is not subject to 
reinstatement.
