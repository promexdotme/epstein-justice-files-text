EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons’ Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey

Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in

New York, New York

Introduction and Background

According to its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP)’s current mission statement is “Corrections
professionals who foster a humane and secure
environment and ensure public safety by preparing
individuals for successful reentry into our
communities.” However, the Department of Justice
(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has
repeatedly identified long-standing operational
challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to
operate its institutions safely and securely. Many of
those same operational challenges, including staffing
shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,
functional security camera systems, and management
failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and
procedures, were again identified by the OIG during
this investigation and review into the custody, care, and
supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious
inmates, Jeffrey Epstein.

The OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of
information from the BOP that on August 10, 2019, in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,
New York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged
in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit
(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,

City of New York, determined that Epstein had died
by suicide.

The OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s
investigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.
Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of
Epstein’s death and determined there was no
criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died.

This report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC
New York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of
Epstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on
federal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2019, until his
death on August 10.

Epstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7

Epstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due
to media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of
his notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated
from general population inmates and kept locked in
their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.

BOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at
least twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at
least one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also
requires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour
period. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds
enable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they
are secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to
eliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU
staff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells
daily, and to search the entire SHU every week.

On July 18, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and
ordered him detained pending trial on the
criminal charges.

Incident Involving Epstein on July 23

While in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on
numerous occasions by psychological staff, including a
formal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations
he denied having thoughts or a history of attempted
suicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not
meet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.

On July 23, at 1:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO)
responded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found
Epstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s
cellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.
Medical staff examined Epstein, observed friction
marks and superficial reddening around his neck and
on his knee, and placed him on suicide watch. BOP
policy requires that inmates identified as suicide risks
be placed on suicide watch until no longer at imminent
risk. The BOP uses a less restrictive monitoring form,

----------------------------------------
psychological observation, for inmates who are

stabilizing but not yet ready to return to a housing unit.
Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24 but
remained under psychological observation until July 30.

Epstein first told MCC New York staff he thought his
cellmate had tried to kill him, but later said he did not
know what occurred and did not want to talk about
how he had sustained his injuries. Epstein also later
asked if he could be housed with the same cellmate.
Another inmate housed on the same SHU tier told the
OIG that he heard Epstein’s cellmate call for assistance,
and that Epstein’s cellmate told him that Epstein tried
to hang himself from the bunkbed ladder. Disciplinary
charges against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation were
not sustained due to insufficient evidence.

Following the July 23 incident, the Psychology
Department determined Epstein needed to be housed
with an appropriate cellmate, and on July 30 it sent an
email to over 70 MCC New York employees informing
them of this requirement. The Warden at the time told
the OIG that he selected a new cellmate for Epstein in
consultation with BOP executive leadership. That
inmate remained Epstein’s cellmate until August 9.

Events of August 8-10, 2019, and
Epstein’s Death

On August 8, the U.S. Marshals Service sent two emails
notifying numerous MCC New York staff that Epstein’s
cellmate was being transferred to another facility on
August 9. However, no action was taken to ensure
Epstein was assigned another cellmate.

Also on August 8, Epstein met with his attorneys at the
prison, as he had on prior occasions, and signed a new
Last Will and Testament. MCC New York officials did

not learn about the new Will until after Epstein’s death.

The following day, August 9, Epstein’s cellmate was
transferred to another facility and he was not assigned
anew cellmate. Additionally, on that date, the

U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unsealed
approximately 2,000 pages of documents in civil
litigation involving Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later
convicted in December 2021 of conspiring with Epstein
to sexually abuse minors over the course of a decade.
The documents contain substantial derogatory
information about Epstein and there is extensive media
coverage of information in the unsealed documents.

Also on August 9, after meeting at the prison with his
lawyers, MCC New York staff allowed Epstein to make,
in violation of BOP policy, an unrecorded, unmonitored
telephone call before he was returned to his SHU cell.
Although Epstein said he was calling his mother, in
actuality he called someone with whom he allegedly
had a personal relationship.

At approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, SHU inmates
were locked in their cells for the night, including Epstein
who was without a cellmate. A search of Epstein’s cell
following his death revealed Epstein had excess prison
blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell, and that some
had been ripped to create nooses. Only one SHU cell
search was documented on August 9, and it was not of
Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when
Epstein’s cell was last searched. The OIG also found
that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds
after about 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and that none of the
required SHU inmate counts were conducted after

p.m. on August 9. Count slips and round sheets were
falsified to show that they had been performed.

On August 10, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the two SHU
staff on duty, CO Tova Noel and Material Handler
Michael Thomas, began delivering breakfast to SHU
inmates. Noel unlocked the door to Epstein’s SHU tier.
When Thomas attempted to deliver breakfast to
Epstein through the food slot in his locked cell door,
Epstein did not respond to Thomas's verbal commands.
Thomas unlocked the cell door and saw Epstein
hanged. Thomas immediately yelled for Noel to get
help and call for a medical emergency.

Thomas told the OIG that when he entered Epstein’s
cell, Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a
sheet or a shirt, around his neck that was tied to the
top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended
from the top bunk in a near-seated position, with his
buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off
the floor. Thomas said he immediately ripped the
orange string from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s buttocks
dropped to the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein’s
body to the floor and began chest compressions until
responding MCC New York staff members arrived
approximately 1 minute later. Shortly thereafter,
outside medical personnel arrived and took over the
emergency response, eventually removing Epstein to a
local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner performed an autopsy and determined the

METADATA_SOURCE: .
METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023364.tif
----------------------------------------
cause of death was hanging and the manner of death
was suicide. Blood toxicology tests did not reveal any
medications or illegal substances in Epstein’s system.
The Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy told
the OIG that Epstein’s injuries were consistent with
suicide by hanging and that there was no evidence of
defensive wounds that would be expected if his death
had been a homicide. Epstein did not have marks on
his hands, broken fingernails or debris under them,
contusions to his knuckles that would have evidenced a
fight, or, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to
convulsing from hanging, bruising on his body.

The Limited Available Video Evidence

Recorded video evidence for August 9 and 10 for the
SHU area where Epstein was housed was only available
from one prison security camera due to a malfunction
of MCC New York's Digital Video Recorder system that
occurred on July 29, 2019. While the prison’s cameras
continued to provide live video feeds, recordings were
made for only about half the cameras. MCC New York
personnel discovered this failure on August 8, 2019, but
it was not repaired until after Epstein’s death. As
detailed in this report, like many other BOP facilities,
MCC New York had a history of security

camera problems.

The available recorded video footage from the one SHU
camera captured a large part of the common area of
the SHU and portions of the stairways leading to the
different SHU tiers, including Epstein’s cell tier. Thus,
anyone entering or attempting to enter Epstein’s SHU
tier from the SHU common area would have been
picked up by that video camera. Epstein’s cell door,
however, was not in the camera’s field of view. The OIG
reviewed the video and found that, between
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and about

6:30 a.m. on August 10, no one was seen entering
Epstein’s cell tier from the SHU common area. The OIG
determined that movements captured on video before
and after those times were generally consistent with
employee actions as described by witnesses and
documented in BOP records.

Results of the OIG’s Investigation and Review

The OIG's investigation and review identified numerous
and serious failures by MCC New York staff, including
multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies
and procedures. The OIG found that MCC New York
staff failed on August 9 to carry out the Psychology
Department's directive that Epstein be assigned a
cellmate, and that an MCC New York supervisor allowed

Epstein to make an unmonitored telephone call the
evening before his death. Additionally, we found that
staff failed to undertake required measures designed
to make sure that Epstein and other SHU inmates were
accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate
counts and 30-minute rounds, searching inmate cells,
and ensuring adequate supervision of the SHU and the
functionality of the video camera surveillance system.

The OIG also found that several staff falsified BOP
records relating to inmate counts and rounds and
lacked candor during their OIG interviews. Two MCC
New York employees, Noel and Thomas, were charged
criminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges
were later dismissed after they successfully fulfilled
deferred prosecution agreements. The U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Southern District of New York declined
prosecution for other MCC New York employees wha
the OIG found created false documentation.

The combination of these and other failures led to
Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell, which
contained an excessive amount of bed linens, from
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was
discovered hanged in his locked cell the following day.

While the OIG determined MCC New York staff engaged
in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence
contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the
absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein
died. We did not find, for example, evidence that
anyone was present in the SHU area where Epstein was
housed during the relevant timeframe other than the
inmates who were locked in their assigned cells. The
SHU housing unit was securely separated from the
general inmate population and inmates were kept
locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.
Access to the SHU was controlled by multiple locked
doors. Within the SHU, the entrance to each tier could
be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or
bottom of the staircase leading to the individual tier.
Keys to open the locked tier doors were available to a
limited number of COs while on duty. Each tier had
eight cells and each individual cell, which was made of
cement and metal, could be accessed only through a
single locked door, to which a limited number of COs
had keys while on duty. The SHU cell doors were made
of solid metal with a small glass window and small
locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff
inmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates. As
a further security measure, during each shift a limited
number of the COs had keys while on duty.

----------------------------------------
SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on
August 9, all SHU inmates, including Epstein, were
locked in their cells for the evening and we found no
evidence to the contrary. The prison’s recorded video
did not identify any staff or other individuals
approaching Epstein’s SHU tier from the SHU common
area between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9
and about 6:30 a.m. on August 10. Additionally, the
OIG did not observe on the recorded video that Noel
and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU
Officers’ Station immediately outside the area where
Epstein was housed, at any time during the time period
rose from their seats or approached the cell block. We
additionally found that Thomas's and Noel’s reaction on
the morning of August 10 upon finding Epstein hanging
in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the
responding Lieutenant, and inmates, was consistent
with their being unaware of any potential harm to
Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s cell at about
6:30 a.m. on August 10.

None of the MCC New York staff members we
interviewed were aware of any information suggesting
Epstein’s cause of death was something other than
suicide. Additionally, none of the inmates we
interviewed had any credible information suggesting
Epstein’s cause of death was something other than
suicide. Further, the SHU staff and three interviewed
inmates with a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell door
on the night of his death stated that no one entered or
exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein
to his cell on August 9.

As noted, the surveillance camera in the SHU area
where Epstein was housed was live streaming
movement in the hallway outside of Epstein’s cell.
Although the camera was not recording the captured
video, the camera was in plain view of the inmates and
therefore inmates would have been aware that any
hallway movements, including into or out of Epstein’s
cell, could be monitored by BOP staff, even if,
unbeknownst to them, the DVR system was not
recording the live stream at that time. As the OIG has
noted in numerous prior reports, BOP staff and
inmates are aware of where prison cameras are located
and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where
they know cameras are not located.

We noted as well that Epstein had previously been
placed on suicide watch and psychological observation
due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous
nooses made from the excess prison sheets were

found in his cell on the morning of August 10; that no
weapons were recovered from his cell after his death;
and that he signed a new Last Will and Testament on
August 8, 2 days before he died. We found that the
staff's failure to assign Epstein a cellmate on August 9;
failure to conduct rounds and counts that evening; and
to allow him to have excess linens in his cell, left
Epstein unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for
hours, which provided him an opportunity to

commit suicide.

Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the
autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by
hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The
Medical Examiner also cited the absence of debris
under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,
contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body
evidencing a struggle, which would be expected if
Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.

Conclusion and Recommendations

This is not the first time the OIG has found significant
job performance and management failures on the part
of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP
policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are
safe, secure, and in good health. The combination of
negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance
failures documented in this report all contributed to an
environment in which arguably one of the BOP’s most
notorious inmates was provided with the opportunity
to take his own life, resulting in significant questions
being asked about the circumstances of his death, how
it could have been allowed to happen, and most
importantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of
whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged
crimes, of their ability to seek justice through the
criminal justice process. The fact that these failures
have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse
them and gives additional urgency to the need for DOJ
and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing,
surveillance, safety and security, and related problems
plaguing the BOP.

The OIG made eight recommendations to the BOP to
address the numerous issues identified during our
investigation and review. Finally, we recommended
that the BOP review the conduct and performance of
the BOP personnel as described in this report and
determine whether discipline or other administrative
action with regard to each of them is appropriate.

Chapter 1: Introduction

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is a component of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that operates

122 institutions across the United States. According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is
“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by
preparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” However, the DO] Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing
operational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions
safely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in
this report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing
shortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional
security camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and
procedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into
the custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We
therefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address
these recurring issues.

The OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of
August 10, 2019, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),
inmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU
is a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked
in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and
other inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2019, the day after his arrest, due to the
significant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.

According to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,
all SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate
tiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10,
2019, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver
breakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to
deliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was
housed alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein
hanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top
portion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position
with his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on
the floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple
nooses that had been made from torn prison linens.

SHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency
and prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 911 emergency services. SHU
staff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s buttocks to drop to the
ground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding
MCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated
external defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR
on Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant. At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and

moved by medical staff to the MCC New York Health Service Unit.’ The Clinical Nurse continuously
administered CPR until he was relieved by outside Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) when they arrived
at the Health Services Area minutes later. The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered
medication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:10 a.m., Epstein was transported by
the EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was
hanging and the manner of death was suicide.

The OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s
investigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause
of Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died.
This report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision
of Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2019, until his death on

August 10, 2019.

The OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as
multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the
failure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2019, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of
MCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a written direction
that the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 30 after Epstein was removed from suicide
watch and psychological observation following a possible attempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of
the failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9
until he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following morning. In
addition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including
overnight on August 9-10, and allowed Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.
These failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,
and provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of
August 10 without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.

The OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had allowed Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to
make an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom
he allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers
in a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York
officials did not learn about until after his death.

Additionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff
on duty the night of August 9-10, 2019, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier
in which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim

Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and
Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and
allows EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can
directly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately. If EMTs had to be escorted
to the housing unit, they would first need to be thoroughly screened, which would delay medical attention.

----------------------------------------
that they had conducted all of the required counts of inmates and 30-minute rounds during their shifts
within the SHU. As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 30-minute rounds are two
means by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being. BOP and
MCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility
at designated times each day. Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member
observe all SHU inmates at least once during the first 30 minutes of each hour (e.g., 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.)
and again during the second 30 minutes of the hour (e.g., 12:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates
are observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 30-minute
rounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”

During the OIG’s investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York
SHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2019, at approximately 4 p.m.,
until Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August 10, 2019. However, in documentation
completed by the SHU staff on duty during that period, staff members falsely certified in the count slips that
they had conducted the required counts. Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that the staff assigned
to the MCC New York SHU did not conduct any required 30-minute rounds of inmates after approximately
10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019. Again, however, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely certified in
the round sheet that the required rounds were conducted. The combination of these and other failures led
to Epstein being unmonitored and locked alone in his cell, which the OIG found contained an excessive
amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his cell
at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day.

While the OIG determined that MCC New York staff committed significant violations of BOP and MCC

New York policies and falsified records related to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did
not uncover evidence that contradicted the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in
connection with how Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said
they did not know of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than
suicide. Additionally, none of the 15 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this
investigation, 10 of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and 10, had any credible information
suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Further, the SHU staff and the
three interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that
no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of
August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU. SHU staff
told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were locked in their cells for the
evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could have gotten out of their cells.
Additionally, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common
area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's
recording issues that we detail in this report. The OIG's analysis of the recorded video did not identify any
Correctional Officers (CO) or other individuals approaching any of the SHU tiers, including the L Tier where

These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute
Check Sheet.”

For reasons we describe below, while the camera inside the L Tier was working and transmitting live video, the video
was not being recorded.

----------------------------------------
Epstein was housed, from the common area of the SHU between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10.

Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The
Medical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,
contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which
would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.

As discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not
the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of
BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,
secure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of
official BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies
with the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera
systems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance
failures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most
notorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life. The BOP’s
failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,
but also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively
deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.
The fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional
urgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.

Unless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining
whether DO] personnel have committed misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this
same standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee
based on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 7701(c)(1)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 1201.56(b)(1)(ii).

In Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including identification and a description of
significant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the applicable laws, federal
regulations, and BOP policies. In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth
our findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set
forth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-10, 2019, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,
we set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security
camera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s
death. Finally, Chapter 7 contains our conclusions and recommendations.

Chapter 2: Background

l. Significant Entities and Individuals

Jeffrey Epstein was born in 1953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and
ultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex
trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 88 371, 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. These
charges were based on allegations that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein paid girls as young as 14 years old
hundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.
The indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash
to recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.

On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States
from France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,
located at 150 Park Row in New York, New York (MCC New York). Following a detention hearing on July 15,
2019, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a
danger to the community and a flight risk.

MCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides
pretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.
The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2021 due to substandard conditions that are
unrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 750 inmates
at any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals
with pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were
serving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should
remain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial
flight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC
New York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2019, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)
pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety
among the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely
separated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per
day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.

Correctional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC
New York SHU at 12 a.m. on August 10, 2019.4 During their shift, they each created and submitted falsified
official BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and
signed more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 30-minute rounds (often

* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. on August 9, 2019, followed by an overtime shift in the
SHU from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. Thomas did not work his regular shift as a Material Handler ina
different location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on
August 10, 2019

referred to as a “round sheet’) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in
fact, they had not.°

On November 19, 2019, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
returned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple
counts each of falsification of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 88 371, 1001(a)(3), and 2. The indictment
alleged that on August 9, 2019, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. counts of inmates
in the MCC New York SHU, and that on August 10, 2019, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the
mandatory 12 a.m., 3.a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 30-minute rounds within the MCC New York
SHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submitted false
documentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to
perform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,
including Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019, until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 2019, when
Epstein was found hanged in his cell.

On May 25, 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred
prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court
record in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had
conducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely
disclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the
U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete 100 hours of
community service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision
and their establishment of good behavior. On December 13, 2021, after Noel and Thomas successfully
fulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the

U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all
charges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count
slips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and
Thomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor
judgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.

Il. Methodology

During the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one
occasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the
SHU on August 9-10, 2019; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,
Associate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC

New York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had

These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check
Sheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-minute
rounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.

requested to provide information.®© The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included
employees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the
days leading up to the response and following the response, as well as other individuals with information
pertinent to our investigation. Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of 15 inmates who had been
housed at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were
housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.” Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells
opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9-10.
The OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s attorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information,
but ultimately the attorney declined to be interviewed, citing attorney-client privilege (the attorney-client
privilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate.

The OIG also collected over 127,000 documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs. Among
these were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports;
documentation regarding inmate counts and 30-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment
documentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating
to Epstein; Epstein’s institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein’s visits with his
attorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and
contractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC
New York security camera system; service records for MCC New York's security camera system; MCC

New York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of

August 10, 2019; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records.
The OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones.
In addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-302), notes from
witness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications. The OIG also reviewed Epstein’s
autopsy report and interviewed the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Epstein.

lll. Applicable Law, Regulations, and BOP Policies

A. Standards of Conduct

The Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch sets out general principles that are
designed to “ensure that every citizen can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal
Government.”® Among other things, these standards require that every federal employee “use official time

& On a separate occasion, the relative contacted the OIG to say that the relative had “photographic proof” that the door
to Epstein’s cell was left open the night Epstein died. When the OIG followed up with the relative to request copies of
the photographs and any information regarding this allegation, the relative stated that upon further review, the
photographs did not show what the relative previously communicated to the OIG.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from inmates housed in the L Tier of
the SHU on the night that Epstein died, each of whom was represented by counsel. Three inmates agreed to be
interviewed. The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not

DOJ employees.

----------------------------------------
in an honest effort to perform official duties."° The ethical regulations also mandate that federal employees
not use federal property “for other than authorized activities.”

BOP policy (Program Statement 3420.11, Standards of Employee Conduct) imposes several additional
standards of conduct on its employees. At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a
manner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”
Because “[i]nattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other
incidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours.” BOP policy
provides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies
that personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official
working hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”

B. False Statements and Lack of Candor

Under federal law, “whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated
U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). The terms “knowingly and willfully’ mean that the subject acted with knowledge that
the conduct was, in a general sense, prohibited by law. It is not required that the subject was aware of the
existence of Section 1001.

Under BOP standards of conduct discussed above, employees are required to cooperate fully with official
investigations, which includes providing “all pertinent information they may have” and “truthfully responding
to questions.”

C Relevant BOP Policies Regarding the Operation of Correctional Facilities
1. Special Housing Units

SHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 541.21-541.33. These
regulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the
general inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 5270.11, Special
Housing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary
segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate
“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of
correctional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in
administrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population
presents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of
the inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,
acting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff
concerns about the inmate's safety.

----------------------------------------
Inmates in the SHU are securely separated from general population inmates and are kept locked in their cell
when in their assigned tier within the SHU. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the
OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,
weather and resources permitting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters
hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the
opportunity to shower at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in 1-hour periods. SHU inmates
may also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court
appearances, medical and psychological attention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all
visitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on
work details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC

New York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought
into a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the
inmate's locked cell door.

BOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 30 continuous calendar days are to be examined
and interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat
presented to self or others.

BOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other
things, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff
member is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff
member must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permitted to ask questions
about the duties.

2. Inmate Accountability"
a. Counts

Inmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are
accounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each
institution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on
“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at 10:00 a.m.” At least 1 count a day during
the week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that
inmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that
counts must occur at 12 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at 10 p.m.
daily and also at 10 a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.

The BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates
while the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This
requirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles
and compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count
in the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and
not rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control

This section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review. The
BOP utilizes a variety of other security and inmate accountability tools in addition to those discussed in this section,
which are described in BOP Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.

Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates, and then remain in the unit until the Control
Center accepts the count. If a count reported verbally does not match the master count, then the Control
Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and the staff members must recount the inmates. If the
second count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book
count, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center. A
Lieutenant must take at least 1 count in the morning and one in the evening.

Correctional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers,
and retained for 30 days. Count slips may not be altered. BOP policy provides that the “official count will
not be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.”

b. 30-Minute Rounds

The BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in administrative detention or
disciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU. In such cases, a correctional staff member must
observe all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 30 minutes (e.g., 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.) and
again during the second 30 minutes (e.g., 12:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.). BOP policy provides that these “rounds are
to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart.” These same requirements
for rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York's SHU.

c. Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement

BOP policy also provides that each institution must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates
changes to an inmate's status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence. The MCC
New York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each
inmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night. The MCC
New York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate's confinement
should be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log
of pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer
system TRUSCOPE, which provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.

d. Cell Searches

BOP policy requires that BOP staff routinely and irregularly search housing units to, among other things,
maintain sanitary standards and eliminate safety hazards.’* The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require
that officers assigned to the SHU conduct searches of the SHU common areas and cells, and that the entire
SHU be searched every week. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require written
documentation of each housing unit search.

3. Psychological Screening
a. Initial Screening

Pursuant to BOP policy governing inmates in pretrial detention status (Program Statement 7331.04, Pretrial
Inmates), all pretrial inmates must have an initial risk/needs assessment screening within 48 hours of

BOP Program Statement 5521.06, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas.

----------------------------------------
admission to the institution. The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,
psychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates
“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP
policy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a
significant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates
regularly is paramount.”

b. Suicide Prevention

The BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.40-552.42, which
require the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal
inmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for committing suicide,
BOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.

BOP policy (Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all
new inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. However, at MCCs, among other facilities
with high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by
Psychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or
appear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting
signs of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who
are placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of committing suicide and
should therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy
explicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has
reason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,
continuous observation.”

Every BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to
inmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For
inmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of
the inmate believed to be at risk of committing suicide. Following suicide watch and based on clinical
findings following a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to
a medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual
monitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general
population or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide
watch gown and will be allowed a suicide watch blanket.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch
when the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant
observation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special mattress,
blanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a lower classification, witnesses told the
OIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that
inmates were allowed to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the
Psychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see how an inmate was
doing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.

4. Suicide Response

Recognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and
inmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that
“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC
New York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.
These orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the
situation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be
taken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff
believe that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue
cardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy
governing crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately attend to an
apparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence
over efforts to preserve a crime scene."?

5. Inmate Discipline

Federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 541.1-541.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 5270.09, Inmate Discipline
Program) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and
orderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline
program applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the
guiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree
as necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tattooing or
self-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This
prohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines
“tattooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible patterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect
by removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cutting falls within this offense).”"* The
definition does not make an explicit reference to suicide attempts other than inclusion of “wrist cutting.”

Among other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,
describes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.
As relevant to this matter, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a
prohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged
inmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate
appears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will
examine the inmate and assess the inmate's competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the
inmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,
the matter is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to
whether the inmate committed the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to
the severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permitted to

choose a staff representative, make a statement, and call witnesses. The inmate is also allowed to appeal
the outcome through the BOP’s administrative remedy program.

6. Conditions of Confinement
a. Telephone Calls

The federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 540.100-540.106, that govern telephone calls for inmates require that
the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate telephone conversations, which
is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution and to protect the public.” For
safety and security reasons, BOP policy (Program Statement P5264.08, Inmate Telephone Regulations)
requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System. BOP policy
recognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permitted to make a telephone
call outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a
secure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff
member coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the
inmate's name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual
called, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the
telephone recording system within 7 days.

b. Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens

Federal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in administrative detention status ordinarily
may have a reasonable amount of personal property.'° Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal
property of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”"®
The BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU. Restricted medications
are administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each institution determines “the medication(s) and
amount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-
approved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post
Orders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove
all limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed. These
Post Orders further specify that all cells are to be cleaned daily by inmates occupying the cell, and that
blankets, towels, and other linens will not be used as rugs or hung over inmate bunk beds at any time.
Pursuant to these Post Orders, MCC New York housing unit officers on all three shifts are responsible for
maintaining “a high level of sanitation” and a “safe and clean environment.”

Chapter 3: Timeline of Key Events

Except as otherwise noted, the following information is derived from the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (BOP) records and the Office of the Inspector General's interviews.

September 21-24, The BOP awards contracts to two companies (Company 1 and 2) to

2018 upgrade the security camera system at Metropolitan Correctional Center
in New York, New York (MCC New York). At the time, images from the
MCC New York's analog video cameras are recorded to a Digital Video
Recorder (DVR) system, which is divided into two DVR systems. Cameras
assigned to the DVR 1 system record only to the DVR 1 hard drives, and
cameras assigned to DVR 2 system record only to the DVR 2 hard drives.

March 17, 2019 In connection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera
system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office begins arranging for
technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY)
assignments to MCC New York to perform necessary mechanical,
electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. However, during the course of the
TDY rotations, work is not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade
because TDY personnel are sometimes used to cover shortages at MCC
New York's custody posts.

July 2, 2019 According to court records, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York returns an indictment charging
Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.

July 6, 2019 Epstein is arrested at an airport in New Jersey and is transported for
detention pending his initial court appearance to the MCC New York as a
pretrial detainee. Epstein is placed in the general inmate population and
medically screened.

July 7, 2019 An MCC New York Facilities Assistant asks the Psychology Department to
evaluate Epstein because he appears “distraught, sad, and a little
confused.” Epstein is assigned to the MCC New York's Special Housing
Unit (SHU) because of significant media attention and his notoriety
among other MCC New York inmates.”

The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the
safety of staff and other inmates.

----------------------------------------
July 8, 2019 According to court records, Epstein is arraigned in federal court and
enters a plea of not guilty to all charges. The court sets a detention
hearing for July 15, 2019.

MCC New York staff conducts a routine intake screening of Epstein, the
records of which indicate that Epstein denies a history of any mental
health problems. After the Chief Psychologist consults with the National
Suicide Prevention Coordinator from BOP’s Central Office, the Psychology
Department conducts a further evaluation of Epstein after his return from
court. Records show that Epstein denies any suicidal thoughts but was
placed on psychological observation due to the presence of risk factors
(high-profile case, nature of the charges, pre-trial status, and

ongoing proceedings).

July 9, 2019 The Psychology Department administers a formal, in-person suicide risk
assessment for Epstein. The Psychology Department continues
psychological observation for another day pending a suitable
housing placement.

July 10, 2019 The Psychology Department removes Epstein from psychological
observation and returns him to the SHU with a recommendation that he
have a cellmate. Epstein is housed with another inmate (Inmate 1).

July 11, 2019 An MCC New York psychologist meets with Epstein briefly and
recommends follow-up visit to occur the next week.

July 15, 2019 According to court records, Epstein appears in court for his
detention hearing.

July 16, 2019 At Epstein’s request, an MCC New York psychologist meets with him
during a legal visit.

July 18, 2019 According to court records, Epstein appears in court for a ruling on the
issue of detention. The court orders that Epstein be detained pending
trial because he presents a danger to the community and he is a
flight risk.

The Psychology Department conducts 30-day psychology reviews for the
entire SHU population. Epstein is not in the SHU at the time and
therefore his review is not conducted.

July 22, 2019 According to court records, Epstein files an appeal of the court's order
denying Epstein pretrial release.

July 23, 2019 At approximately 1:27 a.m., SHU staff hears noises coming from Epstein’s
cell. Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) says that Epstein has attempted to
hang himself. SHU staff observes Epstein lying on the floor with a piece of
orange cloth around his neck. Epstein initially tells MCC New York staff
that his cellmate tried to kill him. Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) tells MCC
New York staff that while he was asleep, he felt something hit his legs and
when he turned on the light, he saw Epstein with a string around his neck
and called the guards."®

Epstein is transferred out of the SHU and placed on suicide watch in a cell
near the Psychology Department and Health Services Unit.

Later that morning, Health Services Unit personnel conduct a medical
assessment and observe that Epstein has a red mark two-thirds of the
way around the front and sides of his neck. The BOP assesses Epstein for
risk of suicide and determines that he should remain on suicide watch.

July 24, 2019 At approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein is removed from suicide watch but
remains under psychological observation in the same cell near the
Psychology Department and Health Services Unit. Medical staff examine
Epstein at 1:08 p.m. and Psychological Services staff complete a Post
Suicide Watch Report. In contrast to his prior statement that his cellmate
tried to kill him, Epstein says he does not remember how he sustained
the injuries to his neck.

July 25-29, 2019 Epstein is seen by the Psychology Department daily and on each date
adamantly denies suicidality or having any memory of what occurred on
July 23, 2019.

July 29, 2019 Psychology Department staff determine that Epstein can be released

from psychological observation and transferred back to the SHU."

When interviewed by the OIG, another inmate housed in the same SHU tier (Inmate 2) at the time of the July 23
incident said he heard Inmate 1 call for assistance, and that Inmate 1 later told him that Epstein had tried to kill himself
by hanging himself from the bunkbed ladder.

The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to the SHU on July 29, 2019, but at his
request he remained on psychological observation until July 30, 2019. The BOP’s SENTRY database, which is a BOP

Disk failures occur in DVR 2 of MCC New York's security camera system,
which results in the system being unable to record, although the cameras
continue to work and broadcast live video feed. MCC New York personnel
do not learn of the DVR 2 recording failure until August 8, 2 days before
Epstein’s death. Roughly half of MCC New York's security cameras,
including those located in the SHU, are assigned to record to the

DVR 2 system.

July 30, 2019 Epstein is transferred back to the SHU.?°

An MCC New York Staff Psychologist from the Psychology Department
sends an email to over 70 BOP staff members stating that Epstein “needs
to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” Epstein and his new cellmate
(Inmate 3) are placed in a cell within the SHU that can accommodate the
electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.

MCC New York conducts disciplinary proceedings against Epstein for
alleged self-mutilation and ultimately concludes that there is insufficient
evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act.2. When Epstein
is psychologically evaluated in connection with the disciplinary
proceedings, he says he does not remember how he sustained the marks
around his neck.

MCC New York personnel attempt to obtain an estimate from Company 1
to run the wiring and conduit for the new camera system, which would
eliminate the need for BOP technicians to perform the work.

July 31, 2019 According to court records, Epstein appears in court for a status
conference, at which time the court sets deadlines for motions and
responses. Upon his return to MCC New York, the U.S. Marshals Service
provide paperwork to BOP that indicates Epstein had
“suicidal tendencies.”

database that contains information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs
of federal inmates, was not updated to reflect this change because it indicated that Epstein was transferred back to the
SHU on July 29, 2019.

The OIG's investigation revealed that at some point after he returned to the SHU from suicide watch and
psychological observation, Epstein asked two different MCC New York staff members if he can be housed with the same
cellmate Epstein initially said tried to kill him.

The BOP’s inmate discipline program and the offense with which Epstein was charged is further described in
Chapter 2.

The Psychology Department conducts a clinical visit with Epstein, who
denies any suicidal ideation.

August 1, 2019 MCC New York Receiving and Discharge staff notify the Psychology
Department of the notation of “suicidal tendencies” on U.S. Marshals
Service paperwork relating to Epstein. The Psychology Department
conducts a suicide risk assessment of Epstein, who denies that he is
suicidal, and determines that suicide watch is not warranted.
Psychological staff recommend a follow-up in 1 week.

August 2, 2019 MCC New York Special Investigative Services complete its investigation
into the incident on July 23, 2019, and finds that there is insufficient
evidence to determine that Epstein harmed himself or that he was
harmed by his cellmate.

August 8, 2019 Epstein is seen by the Psychology Department and denies suicidal
ideation, intention, or plan.

Epstein meets with his attorneys and, unbeknownst to MCC New York
personnel, changes his Last Will and Testament during the meeting.

MCC New York staff receive notice that Epstein’s cellmate will be
transferred out of the institution the following day, August 9.

MCC New York staff discover the disk failures that occurred in the DVR 2
system on July 29 and that resulted in approximately one half of the
institution's security cameras not recording, although the cameras
continued to broadcast a live video feed. MCC New York staff do not
perform the work necessary to restore recording functionality of the
DVR 2 system or address long-standing performance failures with the
institution’s camera system.

August 9, 2019 At approximately 8:30 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 3) is transferred
out of MCC New York. Two MCC New York SHU staff members said they
notified supervisory staff of Epstein’s cellmate’s transfer and Epstein’s
need for a new cellmate. Other witnesses did not corroborate these
statements. Epstein is not assigned a new cellmate as required by the
Psychology Department.

Sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., Epstein meets with his attorneys in
the SHU attorney conference room. Sometime prior to 1 p.m., Epstein’s

attorneys ask MCC New York staff members if Epstein could be moved to
a different housing unit or housed without a cellmate.

MCC New York staff obtain the replacement hard drives to repair the
institution's security camera system but do not complete the repairs
necessary to restore recording functionality and address long-standing
performance failures with the institution’s DVR 2 system.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unseals approximately
2,000 pages of documents in civil litigation involving Ghislaine Maxwell,
who is later convicted in December 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to
sexually abuse minors over the course of a decade. Some of these
documents contain information that may relate to the criminal charges
pending against Epstein. There is extensive media coverage of
information in the unsealed documents.

At approximately 6:45 p.m., Epstein leaves the attorney conference room.

At approximately 7 p.m., contrary to BOP policy but with the permission
of a Unit Manager, Epstein is permitted to place an unmonitored
telephone call to a number with a New York City area code, purportedly
to speak with his mother. In actuality, Epstein speaks with someone with
whom he allegedly has a personal relationship. After the call, Epstein is
returned to his cell, where he remains without a cellmate.

MCC New York SHU staff members do not conduct the 4 p.m. or 10 p.m.
inmate counts. After approximately 10:40 p.m., SHU staff members do
not conduct the required 30-minute rounds.

August 10, 2019 MCC New York SHU staff members do not conduct the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., or
a.m. inmate counts or any of the 30-minute rounds from 12 a.m. until
approximately 6:30 a.m.

At approximately 6:30 a.m., SHU staff begin to deliver breakfast to
inmates in the SHU through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When
SHU staff attempt to deliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff unlock the
door to the tier in which Epstein’s cell was located and then knock on the
door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who is housed alone in the cell, does not
respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlock the cell door and find Epstein
hanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck
and the other end tied to the top portion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell.
Epstein is suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position with his

legs extended straight out on the floor in front of him.

SHU staff immediately activate a body alarm, which notified all MCC

New York staff of a medical emergency and prompted MCC New York
staff in the Control Center to call for 911 emergency services. SHU staff
then rip the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which causes Epstein’s
buttocks to drop to the ground. SHU staff lay Epstein on the ground and
immediately initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). At
approximately 6:33 a.m., BOP medical staff respond to the SHU, continue
CPR, apply the automated external defibrillator, and move Epstein to MCC
New York's Health Services Unit. Minutes after arriving in the Health
Services Unit, an ambulance arrives and paramedics continue CPR,
intubate Epstein, and administer medications and fluids. At
approximately 7:10 a.m., the ambulance takes Epstein to New York
Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he is pronounced dead at
7:36 a.m. by the emergency room physician.

MCC New York staff unsuccessfully attempts to recover video from the

Chapter 4: Custody and Care of Epstein Prior to His Death

l. Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6

On July 2, 2019, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-
count indictment that charged Epstein with committing sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. 88 371, 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and
abused dozens of minor girls, some as young as 14 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The
indictment alleged that from at least 2002 through 2005, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom
he knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds
of dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,
created a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some
victims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In
addition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to
forfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged
sex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.

On Saturday, July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the
United States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in

New York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC
New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The
BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2021 due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to
this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not
yet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain
in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,
or both. Due to the significant media attention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC
New York inmates, the following day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a
housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their own safety as
well as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2019, Epstein appeared in federal court
and pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a
detention hearing scheduled for July 15, 2019.

At the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with
electronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC

New York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the matter of pre-
trial release on July 15, 2019. On July 18, 2019, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In
its ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking
statute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The
court found that the United States had shown by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the
safety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of
repeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were
found during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2019. The court also relied on the
recommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been
charged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses
involved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal

----------------------------------------
obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges
and severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s
criminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a
foreign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and
possession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found
that Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain
sworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine
aspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and
the proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was
unacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the
conduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with
his employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2019.
This appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.

Il. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit

Epstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2019, at
approximately 7:20 p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in
media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a
housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well
as the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or
disciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that
removes an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,
and orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who
was the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2019, told the Office of the Inspector
General (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked down” in their cells for most of the day.
Other witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.
The Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate
Warden 1 and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons
that conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU
inmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each
inmate's cell.

Witnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his attorneys in the attorney
conference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York attorney logs confirmed that Epstein
had daily visits with attorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at
MCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains
information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal
inmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two attorney visits on all but 1 day he was detained at MCC
New York. BOP emails reflect that other attorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Attorney with
the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because attorneys had to wait hours or were unable to

As discussed in Chapter 1, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York
staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological attention, showers, and recreation.

meet with their clients because Epstein and his attorneys were occupying the attorney conference room,
even at times when Epstein had to leave the conference room for a medical visit.

At MCC New York, the SHU was located on the south side of the institution’s ninth floor and was often
referred to as “9 South.” Primary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door (Main Exterior Entry
Door). That door was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.
Access into the SHU was further controlled by a second locked door (Main Interior Entry Door), to which a
limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) had keys while on duty.

Secondary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door. That door was opened remotely by a staff
member in the centralized Control Center. Entry into the SHU from the secondary access point was further
controlled by three additional locked doors, to which a limited number of the COs had keys while on duty.
The secondary access doors were used only by staff when facilitating visits between the SHU inmates and
their outside visitors.

Within the SHU, inmates were assigned to six separate tiers or groups of cells, three of which were
accessible via stairs leading up from the common area on the ninth floor (Upper Tiers—G, J, and L Tiers) and
three of which were accessible via stairs leading down from the common area on the ninth floor (Lower
Tiers—H, K, and M Tiers). The entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the
top or bottom of the staircase leading to the individual tier. A limited number of keys to open the locked tier
doors were available only to a limited number of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which
could house either one or two inmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be
accessed only through a single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.
The SHU cell doors were made of solid metal with a small glass window and small locked slots that
correctional staff used to handcuff inmates and provide food or toiletries to inmates. As a further security
measure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs.

As noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely separated from the general inmate population and are
kept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU. Witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates
are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that, weather and resources
permitting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside of their quarters 5 hours per calendar
week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the opportunity to shower at
least 3 times a week, typically on different days in 1-hour periods. SHU inmates may also be escorted from
their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and
psychological attention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all visitors to the SHU be
documented in the SHU visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on work details,
be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC New York SHU Post
Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought into a SHU cellblock
and that all meals be delivered through the cell door food slot of the locked cell door.

Ill. | Epstein’s Initial Cell and Cellmate Assignment from July 7 to July 23

According to the Warden, MCC New York typically housed inmates in the SHU with a cellmate. Upon
Epstein’s initial transfer to the SHU on July 7, 2019, he was assigned a cell in the M Tier of the SHU with
Inmate 1. The Warden explained that Epstein was a high-profile inmate and that he initially selected
Inmate 1 to be Epstein’s cellmate because Inmate 1 was another high-profile inmate, and the Warden
believed Inmate 1 to be the least likely SHU inmate to harm Epstein.?? Epstein and Inmate 1 were housed
together in cell 205-124.

In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in a Florida state court to a felony charge of procurement of minors to engage in
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute 8 796.03. As a result of this conviction, Epstein was required to register as a
sex offender.

IV. Events of July 23 and the Placement of Epstein on Suicide Watch and
Psychological Observation from July 23 to July 30

According to BOP documents, at approximately 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Senior Officer Specialists 1 and 2
heard noise coming from the M Tier in the SHU, the tier where Epstein was housed. Senior Officer
Specialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Z05-124, he saw Epstein laying down near
his bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist 1 wrote in a
BOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) said Epstein had attempted to hang himself. In his interview
with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 1 said that Inmate 1, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had
been asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer
Specialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the
Control Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist 1 entered the cell, where they
secured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist 1 reported that he then reentered the
cell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview
with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 1 said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was attached to the
bunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist 1 said that Epstein was sitting on the floor of the cell
with his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist 1's report said that Epstein was
breathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist 1 confirmed in his OIG interview that they
started cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,
she saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and
boxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no
further injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs
unsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his own, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to
the Health Services Unit.

According to BOP records, at approximately 1:40 a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on
suicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a dedicated room,
typically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff

or inmates.

Senior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for
assistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring. He and the
other officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not. He and other officers then lifted
Epstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell.

Senior Officer Specialist 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped
remove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical
assessment. Senior Officer Specialist 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health
Services Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.
Epstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had
threatened to beat him if he did not pay him. Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 he had not reported
this to MCC New York staff, but that he had told his lawyers.

METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023397.tif
----------------------------------------
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she returned to the
Health Services Unit, Senior Officer Specialist 4 informed her that Epstein had said that his cellmate had
tried to kill Epstein and had been harassing him. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant then spoke
with the cellmate (Inmate 1), who said he was wearing headphones and was asleep when he felt something
hit his legs. Inmate 1 said he called out to Epstein and when Epstein did not answer, he got up, turned on
the light, and saw Epstein sitting on the floor, leaning to the side with a string around his neck. Inmate 1
told the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he then called the guards. Inmate 1 provided a similar
statement to BOP officials at approximately 2:50 p.m. on July 23, 2019.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant’s report notes that she also spoke with Epstein, who told her that
he had returned to his cell after an attorney visit at approximately 8 p.m. the previous day, at which time his
cellmate was reading the Daily News newspaper. Epstein’s said his cellmate turned to a page of the
newspaper that had Epstein’s picture and reported that Epstein was worth $77 million. Epstein told the
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he looked at his picture, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage.
Epstein further stated that he woke up at approximately 1 a.m. to get a drink of water, returned to his bunk,
and the next thing he remembered was that he was snoring and MCC New York staff were inside his cell.
When asked about the allegations against his cell mate, Epstein said he had been told that if his cellmate
hurt him, MCC New York staff would not care.

Inmate 2, who was housed in the same SHU tier as Epstein on July 23, told the FBI about an incident that
occurred in the SHU around 1:20 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. on an unspecified date. Inmate 2 said he was reading a
book when he heard an inmate scream and bang on the cell door to get the SHU officers’ attention.

Inmate 2 said he could only see the cell door and not inside. According to Inmate 2, Senior Officer
Specialist 2 responded to the cell and then left and returned with additional officers. The FBI was further
told by Inmate 2 that the officers opened the cell door, removed an inmate, placed the inmate in handcuffs,
and put the inmate in the shower area. Inmate 2 stated that the officers reentered the cell and Inmate 2
heard a thump as if something had hit the floor. The officers then pulled the other inmate out of the cell,
placed him on a stretcher, and took him away. Inmate 2 also told the FBI that, later in the evening, around
2:10 a.m. to 2:15 a.m., the COs returned to the cell where the incident had occurred earlier. He said he
further observed the officers clean out the cell and use a video camera to record the inside of the cell.
Inmate 2 said he saw the officers remove from the cell orange clothing items that had been tied together.
Inmate 2 also said that the first inmate to be removed from the cell later told Inmate 2 that he was sleeping
when his cellmate had tried to kill himself by hanging himself from the ladder of the bed.

According to BOP records, medical staff evaluated Epstein at approximately 6:20 a.m. on July 23, 2019, and
observed friction marks and superficial reddening of his neck and one knee. The red mark spanned two-
thirds of Epstein’s neck (front and sides) and was 2 inches wide. Epstein told the medical staff that he did
not know what had caused his injuries, and that he went to drink a little water and woke up snoring.

Later that morning, the MCC New York Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment and
determined that Epstein should remain on suicide watch. During the assessment, Epstein denied any
knowledge of how he sustained the marks on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted in the assessment
report that it was unclear whether Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if someone else did.
Medical staff examined Epstein at approximately 1:08 p.m. the following day, July 24, 2019, and observed
that the central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. According to BOP records,
Epstein told the medical staff that he still did not want to talk about how he sustained his injuries, but he

----------------------------------------
believed that his cell mate had something to do with it. BOP’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) opened an
investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had
been assaulted.

On July 24, 2019, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch. However, Epstein
remained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation
until July 30, 2019.4

The MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the
inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant
observation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special mattress,
blanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a
lower classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except
that inmates were allowed to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by
Psychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see how an inmate was
doing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.

The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who
goes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes
recommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of
suicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off
of suicide watch be housed with other inmates; however, she said the recommendations cannot always be
carried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends
conducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.

The Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide
Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive
staff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief
Psychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be
housed with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.

According to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted
disciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was
insufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically
evaluated on July 30, 2019, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember
how he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2019, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2019,
incident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself
or that he had been harmed by his cellmate.

Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU
on July 30, 2019.

Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.

Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could
be paired up with Inmate 1 again. Senior Officer Specialist 1 told Epstein that his request was something he
would need to raise with the Operations Lieutenant. Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that Epstein
replied, “Yeah, but | don’t understand, you know, we were bunkies, everything was cool.” The Chief
Psychologist also told the OIG that Epstein mentioned to her that he wanted Inmate 1 to continue to be

his cellmate.

V. The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed
to Have an Appropriate Cellmate

Following the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed
to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to
MCC New York staff, on July 30, 2019, at 12:30 p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 70 MCC
New York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #76318-054 is being taken off Psych Observation and
needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients showed that the email
was sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS
Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning
Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO 1. The Staff Psychologist also
completed a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs
to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”

The Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was
ready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding
Epstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an
inmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy
mandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an
inmate with a cellmate.

During their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said
they had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU
staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on
multiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and attentive about Epstein’s special needs.

According to Associate Warden 1, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.
Associate Warden 1 said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant
should have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden 1 further told the OIG
that the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.
Associate Warden 1 told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and
said she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while
performing her rounds.

The Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the
cellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure
that Epstein had a cellmate. Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no
BOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cell mates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was

----------------------------------------
common practice in the BOP for prisoners coming off of suicide watch to be assigned a cellmate. The SHU
Lieutenant confirmed that a BOP psychologist told him that Epstein had to be housed with a cellmate when
Epstein returned to the SHU and said that he passed the directive down to the SHU staff.

Additionally, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9, 2019, said he and all other SHU staff were
aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG
that MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during
staff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required

staff training.

Forensic Psychologist 1 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, she was present during a meeting in which one
of Epstein’s attorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist 1 said she explained to the
attorney that Epstein needed to have a cellmate because he was housed in the SHU and he was a

sex offender.

VI. Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological Observation

The Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, vetted those inmates, and
provided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden. The Warden told the OIG that he identified two
potential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3. The Warden said he passed this information on to
the BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be

Epstein’s cellmate.

The Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-vetted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The
Warden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would
have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an
appropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC
New York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,
who would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.

Vil. Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 30 to August 10

As a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 30, 2019, following his release from psychological
observation, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Z04-206 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.2° A BOP

SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline,
and programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological observation cell to the SHU
occurred the previous day (July 29, 2019). The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to
the SHU on July 29, 2019, but, at his request, he remained on psychological observation until July 30, 2019.

SENTRY was not updated to reflect either the actual date of Epstein’s transfer back into the SHU or the cell to which he
and Inmate 3 were assigned after the initial cell change necessitated by the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.
The administrative error in BOP’s SENTRY records regarding Epstein’s cell assignment had no effect on the events the
OIG investigated and reviewed.

According to OIG interviews with MCC New York staff members, it does not appear that there were any checks to ensure

medical record note reflected that, on this same date, Epstein was provided with his personally-owned
medical device. BOP witnesses told the OIG that on that same date, Epstein and Inmate 3 were moved to
cell Z06-220 in the L Tier of the SHU to accommodate the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device. Of all
the cells in the SHU, cell Z06-220 was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately 15 feet away.

Inmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell ZO6-220 in the L Tier,
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who
would not bother Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the
bottom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new
cellmate slept on the floor. Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that
sleeping on the floor was not allowed and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.

When Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch
Operations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said
he knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch. According to Inmate 3,
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3
should keep an eye on him. Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to
serve as a suicide prevention advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.

Inmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment.

According to Inmate 3, COs brought two mattresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.
Epstein put the mattresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door
window when the cell door is closed. Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate
said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets.

Inmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate
because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. Epstein told Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not
going to cause Inmate 3 any trouble.

that inmates were physically located in the cells to which they were assigned in SENTRY. Associate Warden 1 told the
OIG that the error would have been identified if SHU staff members had conducted a bed-book count, but there was no
requirement to do a bed-book count every certain number of days. Associate Warden 1 explained that during a bed-
book count, the staff members have a roster with them while conducting the count of inmates assigned to their housing
unit to ensure all inmates are accounted for and in their assigned cells. The OIG’s investigation revealed that these and
other cell assignment and recordkeeping errors would have been uncovered had MCC New York SHU staff been
undertaking inmate accountability measures, such as rounds, counts, census checks, and bed-book checks.

VIII. Psychological Evaluations of Epstein from July 6 to August 9

During Epstein’s detention at MCC New York, a variety of medical professionals, including a Medical Doctor,
a Clinical Nurse, and Physician Assistant 1, who is a Mid-Level Practitioner, conducted multiple medical
appointments with Epstein, and Epstein was prescribed a variety of medications for various ailments and
health needs. Epstein was also given an eye and dental exam, as well as a blood panel screening. This
section details Epstein’s psychological evaluations while he was in MCC New York custody prior to his death.

On Saturday, July 6, 2019, at 9:38 p.m., upon Epstein’s intake into MCC New York, he was medically screened
by Physician Assistant 2. The screening included taking vital signs and asking various medical history
questions, including questions related to Epstein’s mental health. Among other things, Physician Assistant 2
annotated that Epstein did not have current suicidal ideation and had denied having a history of suicide
attempts. Physician Assistant 2 instructed Epstein how he could obtain medical, dental, and mental

health care.

At 2:58 a.m. on Sunday, July 7, 2019, a Facilities Assistant emailed the Psychology Department asking that
someone evaluate Epstein because he appeared “distraught, sad, and a little confused.”

On July 8, 2019, Forensic Psychologist 1 of the Psychology Department conducted an Intake Screening of
Epstein that included a self-report, staff observation, and a review of information in SENTRY. Forensic

METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023409.tif
----------------------------------------
Psychologist 1 noted that during Physician Assistant 1’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,
Epstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.
Additionally, Forensic Psychologist 1 noted no suicidal ideations, attempts, or self-harm; no history of
substance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.

During the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”
and that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts
and denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations
were future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.

According to Forensic Psychologist 1, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and
was designated as Mental Health Care Code 1. This is indicative of an inmate who does not show any
significant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need
for regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the
Psychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department
services in the future.

The MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake
Questionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code 1 means there are no concerns about
the inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be followed up with unless requested by
staff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them
under control and the Psychology Department will follow up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring
weekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved
to observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant
psychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code 1 inmate can be on suicide watch.
Suicide watch is for inmates who are showing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.

Subsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2019, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National
Suicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated
with Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with
media attention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for
bad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from
court, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk
assessment could be conducted.

When Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted
the Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. However, for precautionary
reasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could
conduct a suicide risk assessment the following day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,
inmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in 15-minute
increments. Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate

Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,”
not “codes.”

companion program at an institution to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised
by the institution’s Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator.

On July 9, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein. She reviewed Epstein’s
medical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.
Epstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any
history of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s
assessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The
Chief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as
negative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.
The Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his
risk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on
psychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a
suicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.

On July 10, 2019, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,
according to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and
interacting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns
over being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be
housed in the SHU and had also requested a shower, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist
stated Epstein had been provided a shower on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,
to which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein
stated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief
Psychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be
released from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with
a cellmate and would be seen the following morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Following
this July 10 assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with
documented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.

The following day, July 11, 2019, the Staff Psychologist attempted to see Epstein in the morning and
afternoon, but he was meeting with his attorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with
Epstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the attorney conference area for a psychological
observation follow-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,
including not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his attorney conference, and a
desire to attend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief
Psychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this
clinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was
receptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the
Psychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the
Psychology Department. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan and was

scheduled to be seen again the following week. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that Epstein and his
attorney mocked her for thinking Epstein was suicidal.?®

On July 16, 2019, at Epstein’s request, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein during his attorney
conference. The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied
suicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding
additional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact
Psychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The
Chief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follow-up and that Epstein
would be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.

According to the BOP After Action Review submitted by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief
Psychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July 16, 2019, at Epstein’s request during his attorney conference was
inappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein attempted to “bring his
attorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the
After Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide
psychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet
with an inmate’s attorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that
the intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.

On July 18, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was
unavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would attempt to interview Epstein in the near
future to complete his monthly review.

As noted previously, at approximately 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his
cell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general
administrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately

a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely
hanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant 1 assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in
BOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein
did not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not know
what had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant 1 noted that Epstein
had a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-
thirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one
section of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no
inflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was
able to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory
problems. Physician Assistant 1 further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s
left knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant 1’s assessment was
that the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.

Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s attorneys were not “mocking” her;
the attorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and
dismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.

----------------------------------------
Also on July 23, 2019, the Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment that included a clinical
interview of Epstein and a review of Epstein’s medical record, the psychology data system, and a review of
the SENTRY database. According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knowing why he was
placed on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled getting a drink of water the night prior and
then went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment
records reflect that Epstein wanted to know why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had
been found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had
placed the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm
thoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide attempts; and denied
feeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and
that his future plans included fighting his criminal case and getting back to his normal life. The Staff
Psychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff
Psychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.

The Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (1) Epstein
and/or Inmate 1 were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not getting;

(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate 1 had assaulted Epstein. The
Chief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate
he originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate 1) was
less plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not know for certain.

The following day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately 1:08 p.m., and observed that the
central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still
did not want to talk about how he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to
do with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether
Epstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.

On July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained
in the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 30,
2019.7? Also on July 24, 2019, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to
Forensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding how he sustained
the scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,
intentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was
assessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2
inquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying
to remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had
tried to kill him but was now claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic

Psychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cellmate tying a string or rope around his neck.

Following Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from
suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein down to
psychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both

229 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU
on July 30, 2019; however, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2019.

----------------------------------------
concurred with her determination. Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on
psychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by
inmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in
the Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein
stating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it
would be crazy to take his own life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI
that following her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2019, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his
self-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed
signs of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable
taking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was
a step down from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the
consent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic
Psychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation allowed him to possess hygiene
products, two novels, attend legal visits, and take showers. It also allowed him to have standard inmate
clothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. However, Forensic Psychologist 2
explained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they
are re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.

According to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being
housed in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for
him to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological
observation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal
to remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein
was again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.

According to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2019, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the
Staff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP
reports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on

July 23, 2019, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was
provided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that
Epstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he
could not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.
The Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2019, and he was in
good spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2019 incident
and asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told
the OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions
regarding the possible suicide attempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the
BOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex
offender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.
BOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2019, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist
that he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise
was similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be
moving to a different cell.

On July 29, 2019, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of

the July 23, 2019 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. On this date, Epstein was to receive

----------------------------------------
his personally owned medical device. BOP records state that Epstein was aware he would be returning to
the SHU but reported that he did not feel well due to lack of sleep and other medical concerns. Epstein
asked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and
then return to the SHU with a cellmate the following day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist
informed Epstein that he could stay 1 more night and explained that there were no mental health issues
precluding him from returning to the SHU the following day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein
that he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions
and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat
receptive but more concerned with getting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.

On July 30, 2019, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept
well, and Epstein discussed how he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the
noise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed
Epstein had eaten and taken a shower the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 30. The
Staff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content
and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to
immediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-
oriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact
report that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein
would be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein
about routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that
Epstein would be seen the following day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if
needed. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein
needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.

Also on July 30, 2019, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being
able to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,
specifically tattooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2019. In conducting the
evaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the
Chief Psychologist on July 9, 2019, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and
having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the
suicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2019, which stated that it was unclear at
the time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to
the Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 30, the determination of an inmate's
competency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's
ability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her own defense.
After a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the
Staff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.

That same day, July 30, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the
SHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.

On July 31, 2019, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein
and noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was getting readjusted to being in the
SHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was getting along with his cellmate. According to her
report, Epstein explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation or intent and denied having thoughts of

----------------------------------------
harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or
psychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her
utilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need
for follow-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if
needed. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and

SHU reviews.

On August 1, 2019, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for
processing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when
the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided
a form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner
Schedule Report for July 31, 2019, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in
the remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG
that the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was
previously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since
Epstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on

suicide watch.

Following receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist
conducted a suicide risk assessment on August 1 that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical
encounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to
the Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form
noted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident
report he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG
confirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept
Epstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another
cellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to
himself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had
any of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had
reasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently
psychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist
concluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was low, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.
Epstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and
emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted
that Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be
seen by Psychology Department staff the following week to monitor his mental status and provide further
intervention, if needed.

On August 8, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follow-up session with Epstein. According to
her report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The
report further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,
intention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to
make phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly
phone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and
did not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any
unusual behaviors related to Epstein. She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and

psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies, to which Epstein was receptive. Epstein was
educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and also
reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The Chief Psychologist wrote that
Epstein would be seen in weekly SHU rounds and monthly for SHU reviews. The Chief Psychologist told the
OIG that the fact that Epstein underwent three suicide risk assessments was unusual.°°

3° Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that it was not unusual for someone with static risk
factors like Epstein to have received multiple suicide risk assessments. According to the Chief Psychologist upon
reviewing a draft of this report, what was unusual was the fact that Epstein was in attorney conference “day and night
on a daily basis due to his financial resources.” She noted that it was difficult for Psychology Department staff to
interview Epstein because he had a right to his attorney visits, which would last throughout the working day.

Chapter 5: The Events of August 8-10, 2019, and Epstein’s Death

I. Epstein Signs a New Last Will and Testament on August 8

In the weeks following Epstein’s death, multiple media outlets reported that Epstein signed a new Last Will
and Testament on August 8, 2019. At least one media organization published a copy of the notarized
document showing that it was signed by Epstein and two of his attorneys and notarized on August 8, 2019.
Attorney visitor logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York)
confirmed that those attorneys and the notary public visited Epstein on that date. The Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) confirmed via court records that the August 8, 2019 will and other probate-related
documents were filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands on August 15, 2019. Among the court filings
was an affidavit from another attorney who stated that she received the August 8, 2019 will from Epstein.
The OIG confirmed via attorney visitor logs that this attorney also visited Epstein at MCC New York on
August 8, 2019. The OIG's investigation and review revealed that MCC New York personnel were unaware
that Epstein had changed his will 2 days before he died.

The Chief Psychologist said she had heard that Epstein had changed his will from media reporting following
his death. The Chief Psychologist did not know if the media reporting was accurate, but she thought that if
it were true, it would have been useful information to know because it would have been a red flag. The Staff
Psychologist and the Chief Psychologist told the OIG that if Epstein’s attorneys had notified them or the
Psychology Department that Epstein had changed his will, such information would have been a factor
warranting a review of Epstein’s mental state and Epstein probably would have been placed back on suicide
watch or some type of observation.

Il. Court Order on August 9 Releasing Epstein-Related Documents in Pending
Civil Litigation

On August 9, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of the summary

judgment filings from a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged that

Epstein had victimized her when she was a teenager, against Ghislaine Maxwell.?’ As a result of the court's

order, that same day approximately 2,000 pages of documents were released into the public domain, which

contained considerable derogatory information about Epstein and some may have related to the criminal

charges pending against him. Additional high-profile public figures were also named in the released

documents. There was significant media coverage of information contained within the unsealed

court filings.

3! Maxwell was subsequently indicted and, in December 2021, convicted of conspiring with Epstein to sexually
abuse minors.

lll. Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure
to Replace Him with Another Inmate

A. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9

As noted above, since July 30, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein
needed to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At 10:33 a.m. on
August 8, 2019, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to
Receiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for
processing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC
New York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred
and further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/19.”

At 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,
including Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the
Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the
Special Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production 08-09-2019.” This email
contained two attachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,
2019. The first page of this attachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC
New York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2019. This attachment also includes the acronym
“WAB" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the
OIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further
explained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC

New York on August 9, 2019. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed below, several of the email recipients
identified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities
Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not know
he had been transferred to another facility.

B. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Attorney's Request that Epstein be Housed
Without a Cellmate

Forensic Psychologist 1 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, she was present during a meeting in which one
of Epstein’s attorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist 1 explained to the attorney
that because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.

Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Attorney
with the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on
the previous day (August 9, 2019), two of Epstein’s attorneys separately contacted him. One of the attorneys
asked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other attorney
asked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Attorney said he
informed the first attorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as

GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is
managed by The GEO Group, Inc.

Epstein, and he said he told the second attorney that Epstein could not be housed without a cellmate
because of his prior suicide attempt.

C. Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York

According to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2019, at
approximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC

New York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC
New York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily
activities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.

The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,
2019, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The
Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the
USMS emails sent on August 8, 2019, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since
Inmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and
not coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial
inmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-
remove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who
entered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC
New York on or before the morning of August 9, 2019. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told
the OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports
(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.

The OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who
handled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2019. The Correctional Systems
Officer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2019, at

8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to
the OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information
regarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving
their MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call
out list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional
Systems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2019, was no longer available because the
call out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units
at the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour
period, and then it was updated (overwritten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional
Systems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and
Discharge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2019, which the MCC

New York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the
other records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for
August 9, 2019, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from
the institution and not returning.

Correctional Officer (CO) 1 told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2019, he and Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.

D. Failure to Assign Epstein a New Cellmate on August 9
1. Day Watch Staff Actions on August 9

The SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that he worked at MCC New York on August 8, 2019, from approximately

a.m. until approximately 2 p.m., and that he was off on August 9, 2019. The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift
ended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3’s impending transfer, told
the OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and
therefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU
Lieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a
Lieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the
OIG that on August 9, 2019, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to
their position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.

According to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2019, SHU Officer #1 was listed as Senior Officer
Specialist 5. Although SHU Officer #1 is typically the Officer in Charge, another Senior Officer Specialist told
the OIG that, in actuality, he was the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 from approximately

a.m. until 2 p.m. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that since he had the most experience and
seniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge, which the SHU Lieutenant
confirmed. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a
cellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or
psychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant
had instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch
SHU Officer in Charge, between July 30 and August 9, 2019, he told all other MCC New York staff members
who worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in
the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knowledge, training,
and experience.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2019, the SHU staff
received an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was
being removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted
Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time
Epstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were
accompanied by CO 1, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer
in Charge and CO 1 both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his
belongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that
he would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a
cellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO 1 confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications
made either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the
OIG that when he and CO 1 left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations
Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’
Office and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,
there had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,
only to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances. According to the Day

----------------------------------------
Watch SHU Officer in Charge, he did not select a new cellmate for Epstein because he was not certain that
Inmate 3 had been discharged from the institution, although he assumed that Inmate 3 would not return to
the SHU. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when his shift ended at approximately

p.m., he informed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Senior Officer Specialist 5 that, if Inmate 3
did not return to the SHU, Epstein would need a new cellmate upon Epstein’s return from his attorney visit.
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he specifically recalled telling the Evening Watch SHU Officer in
Charge, in the presence of Senior Officer Specialist 5, “Make sure this guy gets a bunkie,” to which the
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge replied, “All right.” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that, at
some point that day, it was likely that he also informed the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, but he could
not specifically recall if he had done so.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that a replacement cell mate should have been identified
as soon as it was confirmed that Inmate 3 had left the institution. He said a new cellmate could have been
reassigned before the 4 p.m. SHU count if it was known that Inmate 3 was not coming back, but the SHU
staff members had until Epstein returned from his attorney visit to assign Epstein a new cellmate.
According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, SHU staff definitely should have realized that Inmate 3
was not returning both during the 4 p.m. count and when Epstein returned from his attorney visit later that
evening. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine was that he would
be with his attorneys in the attorney conference room until approximately 8 p.m., so SHU personnel had
time to make a new cellmate assignment. He said all SHU staff members shared the responsibility to find a
replacement cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found another inmate to replace
Inmate 3. However, he also said that due to Epstein’s high profile, the SHU personnel should have asked a
Lieutenant to contact the Psychology Department to see which inmate should be placed with Epstein.

On August 12, 2019, following Epstein’s death, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge wrote a memorandum
to the Warden stating, “On Friday August 9, 2019 at approximately 1:50 p.m., | S/O/S [the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge] passed on to oncoming staff member [the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge] and
present shift staff [Senior Officer Specialist 5] and [CO 2] that Inmate [3] was going WAB [i-e., with all of his
belongings] and possibly may not return. Also that Inmate Epstein #76318-054 will be needing a cell mate
upon arrival from his attorney visit.” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge departed the SHU at
approximately 2 p.m. and worked an overtime shift as a driver for MCC New York. He stated that he did not
follow up with the SHU staff to verify that Epstein had been assigned another cellmate.

MCC New York staff with responsibility for oversight and staffing of the SHU during the Day Watch, including
the Warden, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant,
the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, told the OIG that they all
knew Epstein was required to have a cellmate pursuant to the Psychology Department’s determination.
They also confirmed that everyone who regularly worked in the SHU knew of this requirement, and that it
was the responsibility of all SHU staff to notify a supervisor upon learning that Epstein needed to be
assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer to another prison. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge
and CO 1, however, were the only two MCC New York staff members working the Day Watch on August 9,
2019, who told the OIG that they were aware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new
cellmate. CO 1’s immediate superior (the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge) was already aware of the need
to assign Epstein a new cellmate. While the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he made a
number of notifications, other witnesses could not confirm that he had passed on information regarding
Epstein’s need for a new cellmate.

----------------------------------------
The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they
did not know Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of
the second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3's impending
transfer out of MCC New York on August 9. Rather, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day
Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York
for a court appearance.

The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant did not recall Inmate 3 departing the institution with all of his
belongings or having any conversations with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge or anyone else regarding
Inmate 3’s departure from MCC New York. According to the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, he did not
know that Epstein was without a cellmate. Other senior officials, including the Warden, Associate Warden 1,
and the Captain, were also unaware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.
These officials concurred that while all SHU staff and supervisors were responsible for notifying a supervisor
in the chain-of-command of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge
bore primary responsibility for the notification because he was the SHU Officer in Charge and one of two
people who saw Inmate 3 leave the facility with all of his belongings. The Captain told the OIG that since
Epstein was in the attorney conference room all day, no one may have even thought about it, and may have
only become aware when they put Epstein back in his cell after his attorney visit that evening. The Captain
said as soon as the SHU staff became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate, they should have notified
the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have
taken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that
assignment occurred. The Captain, however, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that
notified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3's transfer to another facility. The Warden
and Associate Warden 1 did not receive this email.

The Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2019. The Warden said that in the event Epstein
was without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but
that no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred.

2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9
from approximately 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day
Watch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a
Material Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he
began his shift, Epstein was visiting with his attorneys in the attorney conference room. The Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in
Charge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t
necessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but | don’t remember him speaking to me about this. So,
maybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard
him.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his
belongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required
to have a cellmate.

----------------------------------------
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he eventually learned later that evening that
Epstein did not have a cellmate. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after Epstein
returned from his attorney visit and placed a telephone call, he escorted Epstein to his cell and saw that
Inmate 3 was not there. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that
Epstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU
that evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said
SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that
Epstein did not have a cellmate. OIG interviews did not identify an individual who received such a call or
who witnessed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge making it.

Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from approximately 8:45 a.m.
until 4 p.m. Senior Officer Specialist 5 said when he reported for duty, Epstein was already with his
attorneys, Inmate 3 had already left the SHU, and neither inmate returned to the SHU prior to his departure.
Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that he did not know Inmate 3 had been released from MCC

New York and that no one told him Epstein would need a new cellmate, including the Day Watch SHU Officer
in Charge, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, or anyone from the Psychology Department.

CO 2 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. CO 2 said he did not
recall Inmate 3 departing the SHU that day, and that he was unaware that Epstein needed a new cellmate.

The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant at the MCC
on August 9 from approximately 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he was
aware that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to a mass email that was sent to all of the MCC
New York Lieutenants. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, everyone who regularly
worked in the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate. The Evening Watch
Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not know Inmate 3 had left MCC New York earlier that day
and was unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate. He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to
Receiving and Discharge as “WAB" and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have
been notified. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his
shift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed. The OIG’s
investigation revealed, however, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of
the USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC

New York on August 9. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch
Activities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have
known that Epstein was without a cellmate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the
SHU tiers during the round. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he believed that if the Evening
Watch Acting Activities Lieutenant knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate, she would have notified him.

Both the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the
OIG that they were unaware that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities
Lieutenant, who was serving in this position on August 9 from approximately 4 p.m. until 10 p.m., told the
OIG that because her ordinary position was a Senior Officer Specialist, she was not aware that Epstein was
required to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant recalled hearing that Epstein
had been placed on suicide watch, but said she never received specific instructions regarding Epstein. She
said the SHU staff did not tell her about the requirement that Epstein have a cellmate or that his cellmate

----------------------------------------
had left MCC New York. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not receive the August 8 USMS
email regarding Inmate 3's transfer. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, who was the Operations
Lieutenant from approximately 10 p.m. on August 9 until 6 a.m. on August 10, told the OIG that she did not
know that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and that the Captain never spoke with her about this
issue. The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that
Epstein needed a cellmate; however, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant should have known of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the
Psychology Department on July 30, 2019, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an
appropriate cellmate. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email
notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York. The
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate
and did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on
August 10, as part of her Lieutenant rounds.

The Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not attended SHU training, but he
had worked in the SHU approximately 10 to 20 times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he
reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and
asked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The Material Handler said
he worked the 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.
The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him
working 24 hours straight, from 12 a.m. on August 9 through 12 a.m. on August 10. After the Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge left at 10 p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the
SHU from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting
with his attorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned
to his cellon L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said
they left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that
Epstein needed a cellmate.

Noel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on
August 10, which was a double shift of 16 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time
that Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU
were typically assigned cellmates, but she did not know if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said
Epstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her
about a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not know that Inmate 3 had been
removed from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been
assigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.

Material Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August 10 from 12 a.m.
until 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous
previous occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he knew that if
an inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he
said he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological observation.
Therefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with
him about that requirement. Thomas said the SHU staff should have notified the Operations Lieutenant as
soon as they knew that Epstein’s cellmate had departed MCC New York on August 9. However, Thomas said

he did not know that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and that Epstein was without
a cellmate during his shift on August 10.

IV. Epstein is Allowed to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9

For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the
Inmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone
call to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on
August 9, 2019, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:19 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,
including identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that
Epstein signed an Acknowledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to
use a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknowledgement of Inmate form provides, among other
things, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-attorney conversations on any
telephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution
and to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's
Special Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the
telephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief
statement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.

The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back
to the SHU from the attorney conference room on August 9, 2019, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch
Operations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity
to place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their
attorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast
Regional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on
non-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.

The Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call
from the SHU on August 9, 2019, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call
since Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain
explained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his attorney visit back to the SHU, he told
the Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be
monitored and logged.

The Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit
Manager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that
Epstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for
various reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his attorneys during normal working hours. As
described below, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that allowed him to place
calls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allow Epstein to place
the call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was
representing the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said
he did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permitting Epstein to make the call, and he
would have allowed the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the
Unit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as

----------------------------------------
a part of his job, and he would allow inmates to place telephone calls if they were unable to make calls
under ordinary circumstances.

The Unit Manager told the OIG that at approximately 6:45 p.m., he and Senior Officer Specialist 1 escorted
Epstein from the attorney conference room to the SHU so that Epstein could place a telephone call. The
Unit Manager said he put Epstein in the shower area to make the telephone call because COs were present
in that area. The Unit Manager explained that he also chose the shower area because that location ensured
Epstein would not be able to pull the phone cord into his cell and use it to harm himself. The Unit Manager
said he plugged the telephone line into the legal line, which was not recorded, and dialed the telephone
number that Epstein provided. As noted above, the number that was dialed was in the local 646 area code.
The Unit Manager said he allowed Epstein to place the telephone call on the unrecorded legal line because
he believed that Epstein had not set up his Inmate Telephone System account that would have allowed him
to call on the institutions recorded lines. According to the Unit Manager, a male answered, and the Unit
Manager handed the receiver to Epstein. The Unit Manager heard Epstein say, “Hey, how are you doing?
How's everything?” The Unit Manager admitted that he should have verified who was on the line, as Epstein
had requested to make a telephone call to speak with his mother, and it was a male who answered the
phone. The Unit Manager said he could not verify the phone number because he believed that Epstein did
not have his Inmate Telephone System account set up, and he did not have any phone numbers associated
with his account. The Unit Manager told the OIG that after he handed the telephone to Epstein, his shift
ended so he left the SHU and left MCC New York for the day.

The Unit Manager said that when he left the SHU, Epstein was still on the call and the Evening Watch SHU
Officer in Charge and Noel were at the officers’ desk, and that Senior Officer Specialist 1 was also present.
According to the Unit Manager, when he was leaving, he told the officers, “Hey, make sure he gets his 15-
minutes, and after that, he’s done.” The Unit Manager said he did not provide the SHU staff with
instructions to monitor the call. He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and
asked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up.

The Unit Manager acknowledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done. The Unit
Manager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to
bring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front. The
Unit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member
present, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored.

The OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to
public records, died in 2004. The OIG found that Epstein actually spoke with Individual 1, who declined to be
interviewed by the OIG.*? Individual 1’s lawyer told the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of
New York during an attorney proffer that Individual 1 spoke with Epstein on August 9, 2019, at about 7 p.m.,
for approximately 20 minutes. Individual 1's attorney proffer was that Individual 1 was in the country of
Belarus at the time of the call.** Individual 1’s attorney told the U.S. Attorney's Office that during the

The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not Department of
Justice employees.

* The OIG did not investigate the factual accuracy of this proffer. We note that there are methods by which a call to the
646 area code could connect to a telephone in Belarus.

telephone call, Epstein told Individual 1 that the press had gotten crazy, and they discussed personal things
such as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated. According to the representations by Individual 1’s
counsel, Epstein told Individual 1, “They are trying to keep me safe,” and that his case would take a little
longer than he originally thought. He told Individual 1 he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be
able to call her again for another month.

Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had
previously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that
allowed him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System. Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG
that Epstein was issued the necessary documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate 1 was his
cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist 1 also advised the OIG about an interaction that he had with one of
Epstein’s attorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the attorney. According
to Senior Officer Specialist 1, Epstein’s attorney asked him about getting Epstein the necessary
documentation to make calls. Senior Officer Specialist 1 said he then verified that Epstein was able to make
calls through the Inmate Telephone System. When Senior Officer Specialist 1 asked Epstein why he had said
he was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.” Senior
Officer Specialist 1 said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s attorney, the attorney asked how
Epstein could get an unmonitored call. Senior Officer Specialist 1 told Epstein’s attorney that decision had to
be made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.

Noel told the OIG that after Epstein’s attorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a
telephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shower area within the SHU where he was afforded a
telephone call. The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside
of the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and
therefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU
and did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knowledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,
the call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, while Epstein
was still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s
time was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call
lasted for 20 minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also
present in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,
left Epstein alone in the shower, and went to use the bathroom on 10 South. Noel said that upon her
return, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during
the time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation. The Evening Watch SHU
Officer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by
the actions of another inmate. The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or
Epstein in the shower area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knowledge or information
regarding a phone call made by Epstein that night.

The Northeast Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York
official, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and
the call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created. The Northeast Regional
Director said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t know

what happened on that phone call. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein’s death], but we
don't, we will never know.”

V. Failure to Conduct SHU Inmate Counts and Staff Rounds on August 9--10

A. SHU Inmate Counts

As detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to
conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all
inmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an
institutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic
and essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are
a core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations
Lieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is how staff
members know if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.

On weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and 10 p.m.
The 10 p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were
counted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform
the institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the
SHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to
observe and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the
other officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count
numbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.
COs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred
to as a count slip.*

On the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the
total number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and
signed the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then
collected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for
comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each
inmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the
numbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be
deemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number
of inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a
more intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are
counted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were
provided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.

The OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on
August 9, 2019, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10,
2019. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds after
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified. As a

This BOP form is officially entitled “Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip.”

result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology
Department had determined was necessary, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an
extended period of time.

1. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9

The OIG's investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2019, was inaccurate
because SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a
predetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. However, Epstein, who was in the
SHU attorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.
The OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at
p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not
corrected until 12 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional
count and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at
that time.

Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he
told the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of
inmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.

When interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from
August 9, 2019, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his
review, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and
Noel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote down the numbers they
thought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate
(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another
housing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon
the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 attempt to retrieve an unknown item from his
visitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2019, reflected that
following this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:15 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving
and Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are
believed to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer
in Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and
went by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred
from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the

p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the
SHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.

In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknowledged that neither he nor
any other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer
in Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had
prepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day. The
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m.

count slip.7° During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP documents
regarding the inmate's transfer from the SHU and acknowledged further that based on that transfer, the
number of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submitted for the 4 p.m. count, the count slip
was incorrect.

Noel admitted in the deferred prosecution agreement she entered into with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of New York that she completed false count slips on August 9 and 10. Noel initially told
the OIG that she did not conduct the 4 p.m. count on August 9, but after acknowledging that she signed the
p.m. SHU count slip, Noel said she did not recall if she conducted the count. According to Noel, she and
other SHU staff filled out the count slip before conducting the counts because they knew the number of
inmates they were supposed to report.

2. The 10 p.m. SHU Count on August 9

At the time of the 10 p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in
their cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for
conducting the 10 p.m. stand up count. At 10 p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel
and the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness
statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the 10 p.m.
count in the SHU.?”? Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler completed and signed the 10 p.m. SHU
count slip. The 10 p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + 1.” According to the MCC
New York master count sheet for the 10 p.m. count on August 9, 2019, all units had verbally reported their
inmate counts to the Control Center by 10:30 p.m.#8 At approximately 10:36 p.m., the Control Center
completed all paperwork and officially cleared the 10 p.m. institutional count.

The Material Handler said he was present at the time of the 10 p.m. count, but that the count was not
conducted because everyone was tired. The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an
overtime shift from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m., his regular shift from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., followed by his SHU overtime
shift from 4 p.m. to midnight. Thus, at the time of the 10 p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at
MCC New York. The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the 10 p.m. count slip and believed
that Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers. He did not know why the count slip listed

"73 +1".

Noel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at 10 p.m. and that the Material Handler
signed the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her. However, the OIG’s review and
analysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the 10 p.m.
count. Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between 10:29 p.m. and 10:36 p.m. when Noel
walked to different tiers inside the SHU. Yet, as described above, MCC New York records reflect that counts
from all MCC New York housing units were reported to the Control Center by 10:30 p.m., as the count

Prosecution was declined for BOP employees (other than Noel and Thomas) who falsely certified inmate counts and
rounds on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.

The quality of the SHU video footage was poor. Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the OIG analyzed
witness statements and BOP records to better determine what the video depicted.

The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”

----------------------------------------
documentation shows the count was verbally cleared by the Control Center at 10:30 p.m. It therefore
appears that the video depicts Noel conducting a later round in the SHU, as she was required to do every
minutes during her shift, and not the 10 p.m. SHU count.

Noel said she wrote the 73 on the count slip but she did not remember if she or someone else had written
“+ 1" on the count slip and she did not know why “+1” was on the count slip. Noel claimed that, unlike the
p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the 10 p.m.
count slip in advance of the count. Noel said she did not know that the 10 p.m. SHU count slip, which listed
inmates, was inaccurate, and she could not explain why the 12 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that
inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed
inmates in the SHU.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, he worked in the Control Center from
approximately 4 p.m. until 12 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on
August 10. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 10 p.m. institutional count by
himself in the Control Center, and assisted with the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts on August 10 as an
Internal Officer. Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC New York records reflect, that he
had received verbal counts from all units by 10:30 p.m., and further stated that he had cleared the
institutional count at 10:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the count was

officially complete.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York 10 p.m. institutional count, which showed that the
SHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned
to the unit. When questioned by the OIG about the 10 p.m. SHU count slip that listed “73 + 1” inmates and
was signed by the Material Handler and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed that
the “+ 1" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the 10 p.m.
Receiving and Discharge count slip, which listed “9S + 1” on the count slip and told the OIG that it was his
handwriting.» Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the “9S + 1” on the SHU count slip meant that he
was “ghost counting” the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area,
to the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there
were, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the 10 p.m. count, he should have written “73 - 1" on
the SHU count slip rather than “73 + 1”.

According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section
of MCC New York.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 did not recall if he wrote on the count slips at the time of the 10 p.m. count or
during the 12 a.m. count when Inmate 4 was transferred in SENTRY from the SHU to Receiving and
Discharge. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the

p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count
sheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the
inaccurate SHU count slip. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have
needed to authorize him to do the “ghost count” and write on the count slips, although he could not recall
precisely who gave him the authorization or when he had done so. The OIG investigation and review
determined that the only Operations Lieutenant on duty at the time was the Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant, who started her shift at 10 p.m. on August 9. When questioned by the OIG, the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant adamantly denied having authorized a “ghost count” and the OIG identified no
record or witness (other than Senior Officer Specialist 6) to indicate that she had done so. The OIG
interviewed other MCC New York personnel, who said “ghost counting” was not permitted, and stressed the
importance of an accurate physical count of inmates.

3. The 12a.m.,3a.m., and 5 a.m. SHU Counts on August 10

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she supervised the August 10 12 a.m.
institutional count from the Control Center. During the count, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant
said she identified the issue with the inaccuracy of the SHU count slip because it counted Inmate 4 as
present in the SHU, when in actuality he had been removed from the SHU and placed in the Receiving and
Discharge dry cell the previous day (August 9, 2019). The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that
after learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in
SENTRY. This update is reflected in Inmate 4’s Inmate History Quarters, which states that Inmate 4 was
transferred out of the SHU into a different housing unit on August 10, 2019, at 12:35 a.m. The Morning

----------------------------------------
Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count
and create a new count slip, but she did not know if they had actually done so.

During his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate
transfer, the 12 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this
material, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the 12 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to
list 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer
Specialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told
the OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.

At approximately 12 a.m. on August 10, 2019, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material
Handler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were
responsible for conducting the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis
of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and
Thomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas completed and signed SHU
count slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the
a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts at approximately 12:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:30 a.m.,
respectively. Noel and Thomas both admitted to the OIG that they did not conduct the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and
a.m. counts on August 10, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.

Noel told the OIG that she signed the August 10 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had
prefilled. Noel said she did not know why the 12 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in
the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that
Thomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.

Noel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's 10 South
Unit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to
assist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was
gone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU. Noel also told the
OIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately
4a.m., Noel let her into the SHU. The OIG’s review and analysis of the SHU video shows that the Morning
Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived in the SHU at approximately 4 a.m., visited the 10 South Unit at

4:04 a.m., returned to SHU at 4:11 a.m., and left the SHU at 4:14 a.m. According to Noel, no one other than
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3, as detailed later below, entered the SHU during

her shift.

Thomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2007, he had worked in the SHU fairly
regularly and he was familiar with how to work in the SHU and how the SHU operated. Thomas described
his responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are
fed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their showers. Thomas's Overtime Schedule showed
that he worked 21 shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2019. The overtime
schedule also showed that Thomas worked 12 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the
SHU in July and August 2019.

Thomas acknowledged that neither he nor Noel conducted any rounds or counts in the SHU during their
shift between approximately 12 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m. Thomas said the August 10, 2019 round
sheets were signed, but the rounds were not conducted because he was tired that day. Thomas recalled
“dozing off from here and there” during his shift, but he did not know if Noel slept.

Thomas did not recall having a conversation with anyone concerning the discrepancy between the 12 a.m.
SHU count slip, which listed 73 inmates, and the institutional count, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU.
Thomas said he had filled out and signed the 3 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU.
Thomas did not know why the number of inmates was different on the 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. count slips and
did not recall speaking with the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant about the 12 a.m. count. Thomas
told the OIG that he knew he was falsely certifying the count slips when he signed them on August 10, 2019.

B. Staff Rounds in the SHU
7. CO Rounds

As detailed in the BOP Policies section of Chapter 2, in addition to inmate counts, BOP policy and MCC

New York SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the SHU conduct rounds to observe all inmates at
least twice an hour. As part of their assigned duties, MCC New York SHU officers had to walk each of the
tiers of the SHU twice an hour on an irregular schedule, once during the first 30 minutes and again during
the second 30 minutes, with both rounds occurring no more than 40 minutes apart. COs working in the
SHU were required to complete and initial an official MCC New York form, often referred to as a “round
sheet,” which was reviewed and signed by a supervisor, documenting the date and time of each 30-minute
round in each tier of the SHU.*°

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff spoke about conducting rounds on Epstein
every day. He said that the Warden, Lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told
the SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein. To reinforce this message, the Day Watch
SHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officer's area
that said, “MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 76318-054
AS PER GODI!I” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said the sign was hanging on the computer on
August 9 and 10, 2019, and it was clearly visible to everyone who worked in the SHU. The Acting Evening
Watch Activities Lieutenant confirmed that written instructions to conduct rounds on Epstein were posted
on the SHU computer.

© This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet.”

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that

working in the SHU during his shift. The Evening Watch SHU

actually conducted. The Material Handler said he believed the
rounds listed on the round sheet as having occurred between
4:01 p.m. to 7:36 p.m. probably had been done, but he was
uncertain about the remaining rounds. The Material Handler
said he had seen officers “blow off” 30-minute rounds in the
past. Noel told the OIG that, as a general practice, when the
COs went to the various SHU tiers to distribute food or
supplies, they counted that as a round. Noel said she was
aware that she was supposed to conduct two rounds every
hour during their shift, but that she had never actually
completed rounds every 30 minutes while working in the SHU.
When asked which rounds she conducted on August 9, 2019,
Noel responded, “That's hard for me to tell because | didn’t

Note: The image has been modified for conduct it every 30 minutes. It was give out food, pick up the

privacy reasons. trays, give out toilet paper, go down. So those were the rounds
| conducted.” Noel verified that her initials were on the round

Source: BOP sheets for August 9 and 10, 2019, and said, consistent with her

usual practice, she filled out the round sheets and initialed the
round sheets at the start of the 4 p.m. and the 12 a.m. shifts.

Noel and Thomas both admitted to the OIG that they did not conduct any of the rounds reflected on the
SHU Round Sheet on August 10, 2019, from 12 a.m. until Epstein was found hanged in his cell at
approximately 6:30 a.m. Nonetheless, Noel completed and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute entries
stating that she and Thomas had, in fact, conducted such rounds.*? Through review and analysis of the SHU
video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and Thomas did not
enter the tiers in the SHU to conduct any of the rounds and counts between 12 a.m. and approximately
6:30 a.m. on August 10. Noel and Thomas can be seen at the SHU Officers’ Station, moving in the SHU
common area, and in the SHU laundry and entrance/exit area throughout the morning of August 10.
Additionally, from approximately 1 a.m. to 3 a.m., Noel and Thomas were seated at the SHU Officers’ Station
without moving and appeared to be sleeping. OIG analysis of the activity on the SHU computers revealed
that Noel used the computer periodically throughout the night, including to search the Internet for furniture
sales and benefit websites and to read a news article about Epstein. Thomas used the computer briefly
around 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news.

Noel told the OIG that she went through each tier in the SHU at approximately 10 p.m., and at the time she
went to Epstein’s cell and saw him laying on a mattress on the floor, which she said was typical for him.
Epstein asked Noel for his medical device, so she plugged it in for him. Noel saw that Epstein was in the cell
by himself and without a cellmate, but she maintained that she did not know that Epstein was required to
have a cellmate. Noel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately 15 feet away from the SHU Officers’

4’ Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-minute rounds
were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.

Station. Noel said that during her shift on August 10, 2019, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other
than the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.

Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG
determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up
to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein
was housed.

2. Lieutenant Rounds

BOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being
followed. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at
least once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log
book, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations
Lieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the
Operations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and
periodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is
responsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,
coordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make
rounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.

The statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional
Director, the Warden, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the
OIG that Lieutenants should have walked down all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in
the SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, however, other Lieutenants did not
always walk down the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to
store the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that
the assigned COs and Lieutenants walked down each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and
inmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and 10, 2019, however, the MCC
New York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather
than at the end of each tier.

None of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and 10 alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that
Epstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant
conducted a round in the SHU at 11:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did
not specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As
discussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not know that
Epstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his
shift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a
Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch
Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not know that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New
York or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not
attended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the
August 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a
round in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the
round. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not know why his signature was on the form

----------------------------------------
because he did not conduct any rounds within the SHU on August 9 and he did not recall signing the form.
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant confirmed that she conducted her round in the SHU at
approximately 4 a.m. on August 10. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she went up to the
South Unit and then back down to the SHU because she needed to sign the round sheets. Contrary to
BOP training for new Lieutenants, which she attended in 2011, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant
told the OIG, “We are not required to go to each individual cell and look at the inmates. When we make
rounds, we get with the officers.” The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she did not conduct a
round to observe the inmates when she visited the SHU. Noel confirmed that the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant visited the SHU but did not walk down the tiers.

Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the
OIG determined that at approximately 4 a.m. on August 10, 2019, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant
briefly visited the SHU as part of her supervisory duties and conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were
seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU. Noel told the OIG that at
approximately 5:30 a.m., Thomas went to the 10 South Unit, which was adjacent to the SHU, to relieve CO 3,
and that CO 3 briefly walked through the SHU common area as he left and returned from his break. The
OIG's review and analysis of the video footage revealed that, aside from those two officers, no one entered
the SHU and no one conducted any counts or rounds.

VI. Epstein’s Death on August 10

A. Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response

On August 10, 2019, shortly after 6 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of breakfast
carts had arrived at the SHU. Noel and Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-locked
entrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas and Noel were the only officers
in the SHU. At approximately 6:30 a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings show Noel and
Thomas walking toward the L Tier. Noel and Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering the

L Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, between
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, the OIG did not observe
on the available recorded video any COs or other individuals approach the L Tier where Epstein was housed
from the common area of the SHU.

Noel told the OIG that she unlocked the door to the L Tier so Thomas could deliver the breakfast trays.
Thomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein’s cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the window
but could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, “Come to the door, come to the door.” Thomas
said he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell,
and saw Epstein hanged as described further below. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get
help, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps
described below.

. Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein’s cell,
Figure 5.3 Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a
shirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the
Photograph of a Piece of Orange Cloth _ top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the
Hanging from the Bunkbed in top bunk in a near-seated position, with his buttocks
Epstein’s Cell Following His Death approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his
legs extended out straight on the floor. Thomas said Epstein
did not look discolored or very different from when he last
saw Epstein alive. Thomas said he immediately ripped the
orange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s
buttocks dropped approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half to
the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein’s entire body to
the floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was
breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest
compressions until responding MCC New York staff members
arrived approximately 1 minute later. Thomas said he did not
provide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead
or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating
chest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took
over the emergency response, including chest compressions
and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when
they arrived. Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein
down to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and
that he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m. Thomas
said he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
training during MCC New York annual refresher training and
had responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this
was the first time he was the first responder.

Source: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on
City of New York August 10, 2019, from 12 a.m. until the time he attempted to
deliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:30 a.m. and
did not see anyone go inside Epstein’s cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have known if
someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see
Epstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage
point. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knowledge
because he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to
the SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys
required to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone attempting to access the L Tier
where Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where
Thomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death.

Noel told the OIG that on the morning on August 10, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she
unlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates. Noel said that
when Thomas knocked on Epstein’s door, there was no response. Noel said Epstein’s cell door was locked,
so Thomas used a key to open it and went inside. Noel heard Thomas call out for her to retrieve the cutter

and then she heard Thomas rip something. Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his
arms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him down on the ground to perform CPR.
According to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cutter she hit the body alarm, which is a
button on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled
hearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she
stood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only
performed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said
that when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel
said she did not get the cutter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.

Noel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before
she got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall
making any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall
which COs responded to the alarm and she did not know what happened in the cell after MCC New York
staff arrived because she was waiting at the bottom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone
in the SHU for 20 minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get

status updates.

Noel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately 15 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she
would have known if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did. She also said that
there was no indication that any of the inmates could have gotten out of their cells. Noel said she never
slept during her shift on August 9-10, 2019. Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not
moving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading
up to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; however, she caught herself and never slept.

The Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant on August 10, 2019, at approximately 5:30 a.m. The Lieutenant said that at
approximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to
the alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed
that Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”
and that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,
“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The
Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.

The MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.
When the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members
were picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher. The Electronics Technician said he and Senior
Officer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being
transported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.*? The Electronics Technician stated that he

Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff
and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies,
and allows EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because COs can directly escort EMTs to
the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately. If EMTs had to be escorted to the housing unit,
they would first need to be thoroughly screened, which would delay medical attention.

then returned to the SHU and worked there for approximately 1 hour, along with the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant and Noel. The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and
until approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said
he delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same
on another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food
to the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”
The Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU
Officers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood
the inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not
conducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his own
life and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff
members were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with
transporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then followed the
ambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.

The OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs
attempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs show, among other things, Epstein on his back with an
intravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him
wearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York show Epstein in
a hospital gown, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Lower
Manhattan Hospital which show Epstein in a hospital gown.

Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at
the time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of
sight to Epstein’s cell.44 One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from
Epstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side
of L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on
August 9, 2019, a little before 12 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.
Inmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning
of August 10 prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August 10. Inmate 5 said the male
CO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see
Epstein’s legs from the knee down but could tell that Epstein was laying down on his back because his feet
were pointed upward. The male CO bent down to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The
male CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said
both the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said
that once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the
female CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the button. The female officer said,
“Yeah, along time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to

inmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.

revive Epstein. Epstein was not responsive. Inmate 5 said Epstein looked dead when the male CO tried to
pick him up and they both fell. Inmate 5 said officers had trouble getting Epstein onto the stretcher because
Epstein was basically dead weight. When the officers did get Epstein on the stretcher, Epstein still had on
headphones.* Inmate 5 did not see any marks around Epstein’s neck, and he did not see a rope around
Epstein’s neck. However, Inmate 5 saw a male CO come out of Epstein’s cell with a sheet that had a loop
and knot.

Inmate 6 told the OIG that on August 9 and 10, 2019, he was housed within the SHU on L Tier in a cell
directly across from Epstein’s cell. Inmate 6 last saw Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, on August 9 when
Inmate 3 said, “See you later. I'm going to court.” Inmate 6 said Inmate 3 did not return that night and said
the SHU officers never conducted their required 30-minute rounds. Inmate 6 believed the COs last checked
on the inmates in the SHU on August 10 between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. Inmate 6 did not observe anyone
entering Epstein’s cell after Epstein returned from his legal visit on August 9, 2019; did not hear noise that
night; and said Epstein’s door was not opened during the night. Inmate 6 said a male officer discovered
Epstein dead during breakfast delivery on August 10. Inmate 6 said he observed the male CO entered
Epstein’s cell and began performing CPR, while the female CO, who appeared panicked, stayed outside of
the cell. Inmate 6 said he observed Epstein on the floor but did not see a rope over Epstein’s head.
However, when Epstein was removed from his cell, Inmate 6 observed the COs holding a rope anda

defibrillator. Inmate 6 did not see marks on Epstein’s neck but did see bruising on his face and observed
earphones that were still in place on Epstein’s ears.

Inmate 7, who was two cells down from Epstein’s cell and on the other side of the tier, told the OIG that he
could not see into Epstein’s cell but he could see the cell door. Inmate 7 said that after dinner was brought
to Epstein’s cell on the evening of August 9, 2019, Inmate 7 did not recall seeing anyone going in or out of
Epstein’s cell until the following morning at around 6 a.m. He further stated that he did not hear any door
“pop open” that evening. Inmate 7 said he remembered waking up around 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, and
hearing a voice, possibly male, saying “Breathe.” Inmate 7 said he saw Epstein removed from his cell on

a stretcher.

In addition, the OIG and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed seven inmates assigned to
other tiers in the SHU, none of whom had any direct knowledge of how Epstein died. These inmates
consistently reported that the SHU officers did not systematically conduct the counts and rounds as
required on the evening Epstein died and that the last round was either between 9:30-10 p.m. or 12:30-
1a.m. Several inmates told the OIG that before Epstein died the SHU staff never conducted rounds at night.

According to the BOP Form 583 Report of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while
delivering the breakfast meal, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Consistent with the required
response to a suspected suicide outlined in the MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders that are
described in Chapter 2, staff called for assistance and began life-saving measures.® At 6:39 a.m., Epstein
was taken to the MCC New York Health Services Unit, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived to MCC
New York at 6:43 a.m. Epstein was transported to the local hospital, New York Presbyterian Lower
Manhattan Hospital, at 7:10 a.m., and was pronounced deceased at 7:36 a.m.

According to a memorandum attached to the Form 583 from the Clinical Nurse dated August 10, 2019, when
the medical emergency involving Epstein was called over the radio, the Clinical Nurse immediately
responded to the call and upon arrival, saw Epstein on the floor within his cell unresponsive with CPR in
progress by COs. The Clinical Nurse’s memorandum reads that Epstein was cold, with circumferential
bruising around his neck and posterior mottling, pupils fixes and dilatated, and no palpable pulses were felt.
According to the memorandum, at 6:35 a.m., a call was placed for EMS, CPR continued, and an AED was
utilized and indicated “No Shock Advised,” so CPR continued. Epstein was then transported to the MCC

New York Health Services Unit treatment room with CPR in progress. Upon arrival, Epstein’s pulse was
checked, and the AED indicated “No Shock Advised.” EMS and paramedics arrived on the scene, intubated
Epstein, and gave him medications and fluids.*® Epstein was transported to the local emergency room with
CPR in progress at approximately 7:10 a.m.

As noted in Chapter 2, BOP policy provides that the need to immediately attend to an apparent suicide victim,
undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence over efforts to preserve a
crime scene.

The EMS arrival time on the Clinical Nurse’s memorandum is listed as 6:56 a.m. Based on the OIG’s review of other
documentation and interviews, we believe the arrival time reflected on those other documents (6:43 a.m.) is more likely
the time of EMS's arrival. We noted that the Clinical Nurse, at the time of EMS's arrival, was actively engaged in
administering CPR to Epstein and responding to the health emergency.

According to a memorandum attached to the Form 583 from the Correctional Systems Officer dated

August 10, 2019, after Noel called the medical emergency, the Correctional Systems Officer received a call
from staff in the SHU instructing her to call 911 for an ambulance. The Correctional Systems Officer notified
the New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York institutional NYPD telephone. The
Correctional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical
assistance for one of the inmates. The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at
6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein
and a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:10 a.m.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant
prior to 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and
Lieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift. At some point, the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she
knew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done. The Morning
Watch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate
meals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out. Noel was there, but she was not
helping with delivering food to the inmates. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the
meals were delivered, she finished up and went home.

All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not know of any
information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, no
inmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his own life
or had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.
Some MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other
things, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had
been conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,
which resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired
during their shifts. Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and
accountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have
found a way to do so.

B. Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August 10 Following His Death

Following Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell. The FBI
inspected the cell and retrieved what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s
death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player. The FBI did not recover
any weapons inside of the cell. After the FBI's inspection, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and
collected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including
religious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, batteries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a brown
paper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.

Figure 5.5 The photographs of Epstein’s cell on August 10, 2019,
show an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing.
Some of the linens had been ripped into thin strips,
which were tied to the desk and bunkbed inside the
cell. Some of the strips were tied like a noose. When
shown a picture of Epstein’s cell, Noel verified that it
contained a lot of linen and extra clothing. Noel said
the mattress on the floor was Epstein’s, as he always
slept on the mattress on the floor. As detailed in the
BOP policies section of Chapter 2, MCC New York
SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the
SHU during the daytime tours of duty conduct at
least five cell searches each day, and that the entire
SHU, including all common areas and cells, be
searched every week. The OIG investigation
revealed, however, that on August 9, 2019, the SHU
staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE, and

the search was not of Epstein’s cell.48 BOP records
did not indicate when Epstein’s cell was last searched.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that
at least five cell searches should be conducted on the
day and night watch shifts within the SHU, and that
cell searches are conducted in cells every time the
inmate departs the cell. He said the SHU Officer in Charge was responsible for making sure the searches
were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE database. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said
that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious
to enter, and he was busy. He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on
August 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their
showers. He said that during the period of Epstein’s custody, SHU inmates showered on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during showers, SHU staff
searched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9
because it was a shower day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the
recreation area or for attorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein’s cell
should have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9. He
further stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched although, as noted above,
the SHU staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE on August 9 and the search was not of Epstein’s cell.

strips and tied like a noose. Figure 6.5 depicts one such noose, which is illustrative of the types of linens found in
Epstein’s cell; the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.

TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that in

Figure 5.6
August 2019, each inmate would have been authorized to
have two sheets and one blanket. He said that in the winter,
Photograph of Epstein’s Cell After inmates are allowed to have an additional blanket. When
His Death interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge

reviewed a picture of Epstein’s cell from August 10, 2019,
after Epstein had been removed from the cell. The Day
Watch SHU Officer in Charge said there appeared to be an
excess number of linens and blankets in the cell, which he
believed were for both Epstein and Inmate 3, and that there
were possibly a couple of extra sheets as well. He noted that
there were two mattresses in the cell and deduced that
Inmate 3’s assigned items had not yet been removed even
though he had departed MCC New York earlier that day.
According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge,

Inmate 3's items should have been removed as soon as the
SHU staff knew Inmate 3 was not returning. He told the OIG
that any extra linens or blankets should be removed when
the inmates take showers and their cells are searched. He
told the OIG that he believed the purpose of limiting the
linens provided to the inmates was to ensure there was
enough to go around and that it was more of an
administrative matter rather than a security matter.

The Captain also reviewed the picture of Epstein’s cell from
August 10, 2019, when interviewed by the OIG. He said
Epstein had too many linens, t-shirts, and blankets in his cell.
The Captain said the SHU staff were responsible for
removing those items because they did not want to hear the
other inmates complain that they were not issued the same
number of items. The Captain stated that it is also a security
issue because it “gives the inmates the materials to be able to make homemade fashioned and improvised
nooses” or “use it as escape paraphernalia,” such as a rope that inmates had used to escape from another
facility in Chicago.

City of New York

Inmate 3 told the OIG that Epstein was allowed to sleep on the floor, which he said was unusual for the SHU
where that was not normally allowed. Inmate 3 said Epstein also had two extra blankets, which no other
inmate had, as well as two pens, which inmates were not allowed to have. Epstein would ask for things, and
if the COs said no, Epstein would tell them he was writing down their name and providing the information to
his lawyer. According to Inmate 3, the COs were on “eggshells” around Epstein. Inmate 3 said that when he
left the SHU on August 9, 2019, there was an orange cloth twisted around the ladder, strings on the side of
the ladder, and a string tied across the bed. Inmate 3 explained that the string tied across the bed served as
a clothesline, and that the strings were part of a sheet they had ripped. According to Inmate 3, one night he
woke up, saw Epstein fidgeting with the clothesline, and asked Epstein what he was doing. Epstein said he
was trying to fix the clothesline, but Inmate 3 told him no and flushed the clothesline down the toilet. As
discussed in Chapter 4, when Inmate 3 and Epstein first became cellmates upon Epstein’s return to the SHU

following suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while
Inmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told
Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.

When Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that
Epstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he
said there were five blankets in their cell when he left.

C. Autopsy Results

On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on
Epstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the
office's Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy
Chief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner
who performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the
OIG that the pattern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner
explained that a different fracture pattern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck
versus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the pattern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a
hanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in
skin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flow is obstructed and the
small skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple
discoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with
suicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from
his neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally
found only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different pattern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner
explained, a marked and obvious ligature furrow that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as
opposed to a ligature strangulation.

The Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what
is seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is
invariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the
autopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken
fingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a
fight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.
We also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,
which is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told
the OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you
would expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a
sustained compression like a hanging.

In addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in
Epstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during
the autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrow was too broad to have been
caused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood
toxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s
system. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's

Chapter 6: The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence
Due to the Security Camera Recording System Failure

In August 2019, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had
approximately 150 video security cameras (no audio) placed throughout the institution. The Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) found that approximately 11 cameras were located in and around the Special
Housing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August 10, 2019, including one at
the end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that showed any movement in or out of inmate cells and in
the Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live
video feeds. Following Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
investigators attempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the
security cameras were working and transmitting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the
SHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,
2019, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera
was transmitting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2019, and morning of August 10, 2019, the video
was not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and 10 was a
camera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of
the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to
the different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or attempting to enter the L Tier from
the common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and 10, would have been picked up by the video
recorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings showed the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU
staff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from
Epstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.

|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York

All video surveillance from MCC New York's cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)
system. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR 1” and “DVR 2,” and each
consisted of 16 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security
cameras were assigned to record to DVR 1, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras
assigned to DVR 1 only recorded to the DVR 1 hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to
the DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be
retrieved from DVR 1, and vice versa.

The OIG’s investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2019, the
Electronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the
OIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2016, he found that the facility's security camera system
needed to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly
maintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be
replaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.

METADATA_SOURCE: .
METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg
----------------------------------------
The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system
was subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”

The Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2018, told the OIG he was generally
aware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further
stated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be
fixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.
Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2018, the Warden submitted a
memorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $800,000 in funding to replace the entire
camera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December 1, 2018, and an
estimated completion date of February 9, 2019. The BOP approved the funding request, and on

September 21, 2018, a contract in the amount of $698,108.99 was awarded to Company 1 to provide various
equipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2018, a separate contract in the amount
of $34,089.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to
install the camera system.

As the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,
electrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough
qualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the
facility, so beginning the week of March 17, 2019, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for
technicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to
perform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the
camera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC
New York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills
required to do the camera work.

At the time of Epstein’s death on August 10, 2019, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.
Immediately following Epstein’s death, Company 1 officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new
recording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing
cameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2019, and they were
installed in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of
August 2021, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.

ll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2019

A. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29

According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC
New York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2019, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According
to BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2019, when the
Special Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden 1 attempted to review recorded
surveillance video for a matter unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no

* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine
instances between June 2017 and July 2019, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC
New York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.

----------------------------------------
recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the matter to the
Communications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his
shift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the
institution's approximately 150 cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live
video feed but were not recording.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with
ensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did
not perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff
are usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to
the Communications Office. However, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the
Electronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG
found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic
checks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to
record.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he now checks to ensure that all
cameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report
about the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.

B. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure

On August 8, following discovery of the recording failure, Company 1 service request records reflect that the
Electronics Technician contacted a Company 1 technical support representative, who ultimately determined
that two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company 1
service request record, the Company 1 representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two
drives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The
Electronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company 1 Technician that he had to obtain the
drives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he
left the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on
the matter. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to
resolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay
after his shift ended to work on such matters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he
would not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>"

The OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave
that week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager
confirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics
Technician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the
Acting Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the
Electronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that
cameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,

5° For example, BOP Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must
establish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera
systems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.

5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to
several days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.

METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg
----------------------------------------
the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift
ended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some
miscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that
same evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told
the OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that

same day.

The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were
down, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.
The Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on
August 10 when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden 1 confirmed she
was with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she
only knew video could not be replayed. She did not know the recording system for certain cameras was
down. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.

According to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2019, and attended to other
matters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and
attempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. However, the Electronics Technician told the OIG
that no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was
located, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional
Officer (CO) 4.°2 According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO
4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the
Electronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be
at the institution the following day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the
Electronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the following day. The Electronics Technician
said his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors
that such matters did not have to be attended to until the following day, and even if he had replaced the
hard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore
not have finished until the following day anyway.

C. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August 10

The Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, and shortly
thereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he
reported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in
and around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the
SHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video
streams on August 9 and 10, 2019, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard
drive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2019. Among the cameras whose video
was not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.

*2 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff
assigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.

----------------------------------------
Only two cameras in the vicinity of the SHU area were recording to DVR 1 at the time of Epstein’s death.
One camera was located on the upper-level entrance to the 10 South Unit, a housing unit adjacent to the
SHU, near the door MCC New York staff referred to as the “46 door.” That camera captured video of a large
part of the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways
leading to the different SHU tiers, including the tier containing Epstein’s cell. Thus, anyone entering or
attempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU on August 9 and 10 would have been
picked up by the video recorded by that camera. Epstein’s cell door, however, was not in that camera’s field
of view. The other camera that was recording was located in one of the ninth floor’s two elevator bays and
provided video of the ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor’s four elevators.

The available video showed that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted toward the

L Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge. At approximately
10:39 p.m., an unidentified CO appeared to walk up the L Tier stairway, and then reappeared within view of
the camera at 10:41 p.m. This is believed to be the last time anyone entered L Tier before approximately
6:30 a.m. on August 10. Between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:30 a.m. on
August 10, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU
tiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas's admissions to the OIG
that the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame. At approximately 6:28 a.m., an
unidentified officer was observed on the L Tier stairway, presumably to deliver breakfast food trays.
Between 6:28 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., an unidentified officer, believed to be Noel, moved back and forth several
times between the L Tier stairway and the SHU Officers’ Station. At approximately 6:33 a.m., additional
officers entered the SHU and ascended the L Tier stairway, presumably after Noel activated her body alarm
when Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell.

As noted above, the camera at the end of the L Tier was providing a live video feed at the time of Epstein’s
death but the video was not being recorded. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that certain MCC

New York personnel, including the Control Center, SIS personnel, the Warden, most Lieutenants, and the
Electronics Technician, had access to the live video feed of the institution’s security cameras. He explained
that to view the live feed of a particular camera an employee with access would need to key in the specific
camera into the security camera system to call up the live feed. The Correctional Systems Officer, who was
working in the Control Center on August 10 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant both told the OIG that the only live feed from the SHU on their screens was video from the
camera showing the SHU common area, and they did not perceive a need to take the necessary steps to see
the live feed from the SHU L Tier from either of their duty stations on the evening Epstein died.

One additional camera located at the 10 South Officers’ Station was recording on August 10, 2019. That camera is not
depicted in Figure 4.12 because neither the SHU nor the SHU entrances were within the field of view of that camera.

“4 The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the 10 South Unit to be of low quality. Due to the
video's low quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe
movement of individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively identify the individuals. The OIG was
also not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera
only captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers. The OIG found that movements captured on the
video were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented
in BOP records.

The Warden, who was not scheduled to work on August 10, 2019, arrived at the institution later that
morning after being notified of Epstein’s death and was informed that most of the cameras in the SHU were
not recording. He told the OIG that when the SIS Lieutenant arrived at the facility that morning, he informed
her that the SHU cameras had not been recording, and the SIS Lieutenant explained that the hard drive
issue had been detected on August 8. He told the OIG that prior to August 10, he was unaware that the

DVR 2 issue had been detected on August 8, and that approximately half of the facility's cameras, and in
particular the cameras in the SHU, were found to not be recording on that date.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG that the Warden had instructed Electronics Technician to try and
recover any potential SHU video that may have been recorded by the cameras assigned to the
malfunctioning DVR 2 system, but the Electronics Technician was unable to find anything. The Electronics
Technician further said that the Warden wanted to have all the facility's cameras recording again as soon as
possible, so he instructed the Electronics Technician to begin repairing DVR 2.

D. FBI Forensic Analysis of the DVR System

FBI evidence documents revealed that on August 10, 2019, the FBI seized all hard drives contained within
the DVR 2 system. On August 14, 2019, the FBI returned to MCC New York and seized additional DVR 2
components. On August 15, 2019, the FBI seized the entire DVR 1 system.

----------------------------------------
The FBI's Digital Forensics Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, received MCC New York's DVR system on
August 16, 2019, and began to conduct a forensic analysis of the system. According to FBI forensic reports,
DVR 2 did not start successfully. The Digital Forensics Analysis Unit found that the system contained three
faulty hard drives. The FBI forensic reports state that the three drives were repaired by an FBI Advanced
Data Recovery Specialist, but the DVR was never able to be assembled successfully. The forensic reports
further state that an FBI computer scientist and the Company 1 Technician reviewed the DVR 2 controller
logs and found that there had previously been “catastrophic disk failures” and no recordings would have
been available after July 29, 2019.

When the OIG asked the Electronics Technician about this finding by the FBI, he told the OIG he was
unaware that cameras were not recording to DVR 2 between July 29 and August 8, 2019. Neither the
Warden nor the SIS Lieutenant was aware the cameras assigned to DVR 2 had not been recording since

July 29, 2019. The Company 1 Technician could not recall working with the Electronics Technician on any
DVR issues prior to August 8, 2019, but he said that if the entire DVR 2 server went down on July 29, 2019, no
video would have been able to have been retrieved from that point forward from any of the cameras
recording to DVR 2.

Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations

l. Conclusions

Our investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of
Jeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional
Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate
counts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which
compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,
we found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,
among other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate
counts and 30-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special
Housing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.

We further found that multiple BOP employees submitted false documents claiming that they had
performed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor
when questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York
employees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to
their conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York
subsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court
dismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their
agreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for
other MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, who the OIG found also
created, certified, and submitted false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day
before and the day of Epstein’s death.

The OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive
that Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor allowed Epstein to make an
unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.

The OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and
unmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on

August 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day.
Additionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability
of MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed below, we make a number of
recommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation

and review.

While the OIG determined that MCC New York staff committed significant violations of BOP and MCC

New York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did
not uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding
the absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were
interviewed by the OIG said they did not know of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death
was something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible
information that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.

----------------------------------------
As detailed in Chapter 4 of this report, the SHU was a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates
were securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for
approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.
Access to the SHU was controlled by multiple locked doors. The primary entrance to the SHU (Main Exterior
Entry Door) was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.
Additionally, there was a second locked door at the main entrance (Main Interior Entry Door), which could
be opened only with a key held by a limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) while on duty.°> Within the
SHU, the entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or bottom of the
staircase leading to the individual tier. Keys to open the locked tier doors were available only to a limited
number of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which could house either one or two
inmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be accessed only through a
single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty. The SHU cell doors were
made of solid metal with a small glass window and small locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff
inmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates. As a further security measure, during each shift a
limited number of the COs had keys while on duty.

BOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells overnight. The OIG found no
evidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was
housed was unlocked on the evening of August 9-10, 2019, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at
approximately 8 p.m. SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were
locked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could
have gotten out of their cells. Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC
New York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-10. The door to
Epstein’s cell was visible from the SHU Officers’ Station, and CO Tova Noel and Material Handler

Michael Thomas told the OIG that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell during their shift on August 10.
Both of them further described delivering breakfast to the L Tier at about 6:30 a.m. on August 10, and how
Noel unlocked the door to the L Tier, Thomas entered the L Tier and called for Epstein, and then Thomas
unlocked his cell door when Epstein failed to respond. Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in
the same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and 10, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s
cell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein
to his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC
New York SHU.

Further, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of
the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's video
recording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6. The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any
COs (other than those assigned to the SHU during that timeframe or had a specific reason for visiting the
SHU) or other individuals present in the common area of the SHU approach any of the SHU tiers, including
the L Tier where Epstein was housed, between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and approximately
6:30 a.m. on August 10. In sum, the OIG’s investigation did not find any evidence that anyone was present in

The primary entrance doors to the MCC New York SHU are shown in Figure 4.1. Access to the secondary entrance to
the SHU, which was adjacent to the elevator bay on the south side of the floor, was also controlled by an exterior entry
door opened by the Control Center and an interior door opened only with a key held by one of the COs assigned to the
SHU while on duty. The secondary entrance doors to the SHU are shown in Figure 4.2.

----------------------------------------
the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier
of the SHU.

We also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shown in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in
plain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,
including into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,
unbeknownst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that
time. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and
inmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where
they know cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the
SHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station
immediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the
L Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August 10 upon finding
Epstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,
was consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s
cell at about 6:30 a.m. on August 10.

We further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation
due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his
cell on the morning of August 10; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days
before he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates
who were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not
systematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the
SHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was
unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an
opportunity for him to commit suicide.

Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The
Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrow was too broad to have been caused by the
electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications
or illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris
under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that
would have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a
homicide by strangulation.

This is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on
the part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that
inmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2022 investigation and
review of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and

----------------------------------------
management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and
serious transgressions that occurred in this matter came to light largely because they involved a high-profile
inmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and
Bulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the
custody and care of such inmates.

Regrettably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has
investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning
inmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has
two open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving
an inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.

This investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.
Witnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate
accountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one
staff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As
discussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to
address staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2023, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing
shortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2015.°°

Further, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been attentive to the needs
of inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inattention manifested in the failure of MCC

New York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC

New York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2019 incident in which Epstein was
discovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2023 report, the OIG found that BOP
psychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who
died by suicide while in COVID-19 quarantine units between March 2020 and April 2021.°? The OIG’s 2017
report on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling
may present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding
the use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2023.

Lastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follow, the persistent
deficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.

----------------------------------------
The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s
custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life, resulting in significant questions being asked
about the circumstances of his death, how it could have been allowed to have happen, and most
importantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged
crimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have
been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for
Department of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and
related problems plaguing the BOP.

The OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.

Unless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining
whether DOJ personnel have committed misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this
same standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee
based on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. § 7701(c)(1)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 1201.56(b)(1)(ii).

A. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as
Instructed by the Psychology Department on July 30

On July 30, 2019, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 70 BOP staff members
stating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's
directive that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2019,
when Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s
cellmate at the time (Inmate 1) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another
inmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate 1's
account. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he
thought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not know what had
occurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the
same cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.

As a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.
Consistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the
OIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses
said staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. However,
despite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 30 email instruction and the subsequent
verbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on
August 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.

1. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a
New Cellmate

The OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU
failed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York
and therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required
notifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further below—

----------------------------------------
resulted in Epstein being housed without a cellmate at the time of his death, which was contrary to the
Psychology Department's directive issued just 10 days earlier.

BOP standards of conduct require that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”®' MCC
New York Post Orders for the SHU require, among other things, that all SHU officers “maintain a log of
pertinent information regarding inmate activity, detailing time, persons involved (if pertinent) and the event,
which must be logged into TRUSCOPE.”® Importantly, the SHU Post Orders clarify that they “are not
intended to describe in detail all the officer's responsibilities. Good judgment and common sense are
expected in all situations not covered in these post orders.”

On August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and CO
Tova Noel were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly assigned post and
served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.°? The OIG investigation found that each
of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology
Department's directive.

The OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU
Officer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s
cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all
MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the
institution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge and CO 1, who was also assigned to the SHU, reviewed the MCC New York daily call out list,
a document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, which listed Inmate 3
as being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings. At approximately 8:30 a.m., CO 1
escorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the
Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for his
daily meeting with his attorneys. During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO 1
discussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer. The Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared following Epstein’s death,
that he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new
cellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant. However, the OIG did not credit the Day
Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in
fact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.

BOP Program Statement 3420.11.

TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.

Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at 10 p.m. on
August 9, 2019.

Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave
the facility.

The OIG did not find that CO 1 failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-
of-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.

METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023467.tif
----------------------------------------
The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening
Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening
Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s
telephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed
the need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG
that he notified an unspecified supervisor. However, other witnesses did not corroborate his account. Noel
told the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been
removed from the institution. Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately

p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s
medical device for him. The OIG did not credit Noel's statements that she did not know that Epstein needed
a cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements
(including her own) regarding SHU staff's knowledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s
transfer out of the SHU.®

The OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening
Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was
permanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of
conduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these
individuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, all of these officers
failed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not
immediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who
had been released from suicide watch and psychological observation 10 days earlier had an

appropriate cellmate.

2. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff

The OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,
which contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather
than passively relying on a notification from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation
under federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included
supervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch
Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the
U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2019, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be
transferred to another facility the following day. If any of these supervisors had read the email attachment,
they would have known of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. Instead, many of these individuals
told the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he
would not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate. The SHU Lieutenant's shift on August 8 ended over
an hour before the USMS sent the email notification and he was not working on August 9. In his absence,
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations
Lieutenant, and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective

Noel reviewed a draft of the report and we considered her comments but made no changes as a result.

shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these
individuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been
on suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance
failure.

3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate

Additionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein
constituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew
that Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with
Epstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive
leadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate following the events of July 23, 2019. The Warden told
the OIG that no inmates were pre-vetted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The
Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been
removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to
ensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple
steps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time
and ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2019.

4. Lack of Candor

BOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by
providing all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding
to questions.””°

As discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told
the OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.
Based on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in
their OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation
of BOP policy when she said she did not know that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate
Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.

The OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the
OIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with
acellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members
who responded to the July 23, 2019 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide
watch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 30, 2019

The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on
August 9, 2019, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cell mate requirement. The OIG credited her account
because she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 30,
2019 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2019 email notifying
that Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the following day.

Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates
for Epstein.

Epstein’s cellmate requirement was widely disseminated verbally by MCC New York leadership.

B. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct Mandatory Rounds and Inmate Counts
Resulting in Epstein Being Unobserved for Hours Before His Death

The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9 and 10, 2019, MCC New York SHU staff did not
conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their shift in the SHU. The failure to undertake
these required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to
properly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further below—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for
hours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an
appropriate cellmate.

1. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU

Federal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.””!
Additionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that
fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.””* Because
“[i]Jnattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,”
BOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours.”
BOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and
inmate counts.’”? Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and
ensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health.

BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability
measures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice
each hour, no more than 40 minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify
that at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at 12 a.m., 3.a.m., 5a.m.,
p.m., and 10 p.m. daily, and also at 10 a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.

The OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the
SHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:15 p.m. on August 9, 2019; however, this inmate transfer
was not documented until approximately 12:35 a.m. on August 10, 2019. Based on this internal transfer,
BOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. SHU inmate counts
on August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which
did not show COs walking up or down the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a
process that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.”* During their OIG interviews, the
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael
Thomas each admitted that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU

BOP Program Statement 3420.11.
® BOP Program Statement 5500.14.

™ As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of low quality. Therefore, the OIG
analyzed the video in conjunction with BOP records and witness statements regarding the personnel in the SHU and
their activities.

on the evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10. Noel told the OIG that she conducted the 10 p.m.
count on August 9. The OIG did not credit her statement based on: (1) its review of the SHU security
camera video, which reflects Noel walking up and down the stairs leading to some, but not all, of the tiers
several minutes after the SHU inmate count had been called into the Control Center; (2) the 10 p.m. count
slip, which erroneously included the SHU Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and
Delivery; (3) other BOP records; and (4) the Material Handler’s statement to the OIG that no one conducted
the 10 p.m. count because everyone was tired.

Instead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found
that officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, including the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas
primarily remained seated in the SHU Officers’ Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time,
suggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of Internet searches on MCC New York
computers. Thomas also admitted to the OIG that he “dozed off” for periods of time during his shift. The
OIG’s analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately 10:40 p.m., no CO
entered Epstein’s tier in the SHU until just before 6:30 a.m. when Noel and Thomas began to serve breakfast
to the inmates.

The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material
Handler, Noel, and Thomas failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their
respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that their actions constituted
violations of 5 C.F.R. 88 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and
MCC New York SHU Post Orders.

2. False Statements and Lack of Candor

The OIG’s investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in
Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by
attesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not.

Federal law provides that “whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated
U.S.C. 8 1001(a)(3).

As discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler,
Noel, and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each
institutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two COs to conduct each
count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York form, often called a
count slip.”> On the count slip, both COs are required to fill in the date and time the count had been
performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then sign the
count slip. Once the COs complete and sign the count slips, the count slips are then collected and delivered
to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center are responsible for comparing
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each

This BOP form is officially entitled “Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip.”

inmate was accounted for.’”° Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and
the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the
institutional count be deemed “cleared” or completed.

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or
signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability
responsibilities when, in fact, they had not.”” These individuals admitted to the OIG that instead of
performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed
were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the
documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts. Additionally, Noel admitted
to the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 30-minute
rounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely attested to having completed the rounds.”®

Noel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and
rounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office
for the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York
declined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.

The OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,
and Thomas knowingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by attesting that they
had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2019, and morning of
August 10, 2019.

Additionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation
and truthfully respond to questions. The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she
had conducted the 10 p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have
conducted a round at the time.

3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime

The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York supervisory staff
requested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member
working three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.

The collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides
that “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 %) hours, and the

*% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed
the 10 p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.

This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet.”

minimum elapsed time of on ‘days off’ will be fifty-six (56) hours, except when the employee requests
the change.””?

The Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12 a.m.
to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day
shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler
if he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt
pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from 12 a.m. on August 9
through 12 a.m. on August 10. As discussed previously, the Material Handler admitted to the OIG that on
the evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the
mandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.

The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor
judgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift. As the Day Watch
Operations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have known
that the Material Handler had already worked 16 straight hours. Additionally, the Day Watch Operations
Lieutenant's action was inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and did not reflect sound
correctional judgment, as it would have been extremely difficult for the Material Handler to have effectively
performed his duties during his third shift.

4. Clearing the 10 p.m. Institutional Count Knowing that It Was Inaccurate

The OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff cleared the
p.m. institutional count knowing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate.

BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that COs conducting an institutional count relay the
count verbally to the Control Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates.®° If a count reported
verbally does not match the master count, the Control Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and
the staff members must recount the inmates. MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount
slips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.”

As discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU
to Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer. The
failure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts,
resulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number
of inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the 10 p.m. institutional count.

During his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admitted that
he amended the 10 p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an attempt to
reflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU following the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a
SHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day. Senior Officer Specialist 6
acknowledged that he should have requested a recount from the SHU, but instead he cleared the 10 p.m.

count. Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was known as “ghost counting,”
something he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations Lieutenant or
someone of a higher rank than himself. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having
authorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.

The OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving
and Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the 10 p.m. institutional count
knowing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.

5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds

The OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,
which contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed
above, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the
performance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®' Additionally, BOP
policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are

being followed.®

The OIG’s investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°*? The Evening Watch
Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct
any rounds in the SHU. He acknowledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did
not sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at 10 p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the 12 a.m. count on August 10, which was due to SHU
staff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the
inmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have
conducted another count and submitted a new count slip, but she did not know if they actually did so.

During her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at
approximately 4 a.m. on August 10. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed
that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during
which time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station
in the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not
required to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of
the Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty. This description of a Lieutenant round

5 C.F.R. 8 2635.101(b)(5); see also 5 C.F.R. 8 2635.705(a).
BOP Program Statement 5270.11.

The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant also had oversight over the SHU during her overtime shift (4 p.m. to

p.m. on August 9, 2019) in an acting capacity. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening
Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any
institutional counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift. The Acting Evening Watch Activities
Lieutenant also told the OIG that she conducted one round in the SHU sometime between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., during which
time she walked down all of the tiers.

----------------------------------------
is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which
emphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk down all of the SHU tiers during a round. During their
interviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden 1, and the Captain
clarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk
down each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that
the Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk down each of the tiers to check on the inmates in
the SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,
SHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP
Lieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant attended in 2011, taught that
Operations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit
will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,
Operations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs
and reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.

The OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant
to adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to
conduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.

C. MCC New York Staff Allowed Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on
August 9

The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an
unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to

7:19 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,
including the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.

Federal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate
telephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution
and to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone
calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in
times of crisis,” inmates may be permitted to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone
System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and
“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the
BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date
and time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special
Investigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.

The OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2019, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit
Manager told the OIG that after Epstein’s attorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allow Epstein to place a
telephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that
Epstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System. The OIG’s

investigation established both that Epstein’s mother was deceased at the time he asked to telephone her
and that Epstein had been assigned the necessary documentation that would have allowed him to place
calls through the Inmate Telephone System, although he did not take the necessary steps to complete the
setup process that would have given him the ability to place calls through that system. The Captain told the
OIG that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his attorney visit back to the SHU and Epstein’s
requested call was discussed, he told the Unit Manager that Epstein’s telephone call had to be monitored
and logged.

The Unit Manager told the OIG that he escorted Epstein from his attorney visit to the shower area of the
SHU, where he connected a telephone into an unrecorded legal line and dialed the phone number provided
by Epstein. The Unit Manager said that when a male answered the call, he handed the telephone to Epstein,
and then left MCC New York for the day because his shift had ended. Before leaving the SHU, the Unit
Manager said he told the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, and Noel, who were at
the SHU Officers’ Station, to make sure Epstein got his 15 minutes on the telephone, but he did not instruct
them to monitor the telephone call. The Unit Manager admitted that he did not verify the recipient of the
telephone call, and that neither he nor anyone monitored or logged the telephone call as required.

The OIG found that the Unit Manager violated BOP policy by allowing Epstein to make an unrecorded and
unmonitored telephone call, and by failing to verify the telephone call recipient, monitor, and log the call.
We further found that the Unit Manager exercised poor judgment when he left MCC New York while Epstein
was still on the telephone call that the Unit Manager had arranged and failed to instruct the Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, or Noel to monitor the call.

D. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct and Document Cell Searches and Eliminate
Safety Hazards in Epstein’s Cell on August 9 Leaving Epstein with Excessive Linens
in His Cell

The OIG’s investigation and review determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9,
2019, failed to conduct and document searches of Epstein’s cell in the SHU. BOP policy requires that BOP
staff routinely and irregularly search housing units.2° MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU staff
conduct at least five cell searches each shift during daytime and evening hours (7:45 a.m. to 12 a.m.), in
addition to other searches of SHU cells and common areas, and BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post
Orders require written documentation of cell searches. BOP policy explains that the purpose of cell
searches is to, among other things, maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate safety hazards. To that end,
MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders provide that when an inmate is transferred out of a
facility, all of the inmate's linens should be taken to Receiving and Discharge.

The OIG reviewed MCC New York SHU TRUSCOPE entries for August 9, and identified only one cell search
entered by MCC New York SHU staff for the entire day. During his interview with the OIG, the Day Watch
SHU Officer in Charge stated that multiple cell searches were conducted in the MCC New York SHU on
August 9; however, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches
within the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties. The Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge further stated that any of the SHU staff could have logged the cell searches into

BOP Program Statement 5521.06.

TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so. The Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches
during his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive
amount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the
OIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an
improvised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.

The OIG found that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the
required cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU
conducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York
SHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in
Charge during their respective shifts on August 9 and 10, 2019, to have permitted Epstein to have an
excessive amount of linens in his cell.

E. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera
System was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence

This investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera
system. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was
being housed to not record video starting in late July 2019 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s
death on August 10, 2019. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on

July 29, 2019, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's
cameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with
no video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until 11 days later on
August 8, 2019. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore
recording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after
Epstein’s death.

The Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.
The Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in

September 2018, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $730,000 to purchase new equipment for the
camera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components
approximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The
new cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management
faced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not
allow for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as
of August 2021—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the
system upgrade still had not been completed.*’

The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2021 due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this
investigation and review.

----------------------------------------
MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely
repairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system
of security cameras. Dating back to at least 2013, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the
BOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,
poor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2016 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction
efforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP
evaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2016 recommendation, the BOP
assessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its
122 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade
the systems at those 45 institutions between 2019 and 2021. In June 2021, the BOP reported that it had
updated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed
additional cameras to bolster surveillance. However, as reported in an October 2021 Management Advisory
Memorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found
that the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2016 OIG report. In its
2021 Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive
strategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with
a strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system
concerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2023, the OIG’s 2021 recommendation

remains open.

The BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at
individual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential
to impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the
BOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate
security risks.

Il. Recommendations

The OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to
ensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of
inmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for
suicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and
institutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.

1. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch
or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular
individual or security considerations.

According to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy
Statement 5324.08, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate. The supplemental

5324.08 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming
off of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of
suicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”

The OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knowledge gaps among MCC New York staff
regarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff
would be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all
inmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for
exceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining
when a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and
communicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.

2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for
whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan
for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular
individual or security considerations.

The OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a
new cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a
new cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff
failing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a
contingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein
needed a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which
was consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a
list of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed
alone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for
cellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or
security considerations.

3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval
for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the
process, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should
include in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on
suicide watch or psychological observation.

According to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.08 and the MCC New York
Institution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant
observation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states
that only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of
Programs will visitation either social or legal be permitted for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the

----------------------------------------
MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation states that inmates on psychological
observation will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member.

A review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2019, revealed Epstein was allowed to leave the
suicide watch room to visit with his attorneys for more than 6 hours. According to the Psychological
Reconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s
psychological observation on July 24 through July 30, 2019, Epstein was also allowed to visit with his
attorneys between 8-11 hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York
supplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide
watch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by
the Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement
5324.08 does not describe any process or procedures that allows an inmate to have legal or social visits
while on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate
its current process for such visits to be approved and documented.

4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and
wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods
through policy, training, or other measures.

The OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,
MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, did not conduct many of the required
rounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,
including cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and
the Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility
as accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting
for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods
through policy, training, or other measures.

5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.

The OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff
assigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one
round in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.
During their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what
should be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was
not memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP
develop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of
supervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to better ensure that BOP staff are

appropriately supervised.

6. The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing
shortages at its prisons.

Since at least 2015, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including
medical staffing shortages.®° This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies
on inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—
on August 9, 2019, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for
inmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the 10 p.m.
SHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in
connection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office
arranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC
New York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of
the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY
staff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP
cannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends
that the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.

7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be
appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.

The OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at
the time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,
but they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG
present a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the
institution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make
changes as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.

conducted as part of its pandemic response oversight work revealed that staffing shortages impacted the BOP’s ability
to respond to inmates’ medical needs during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. These findings are summarized
in the OIG’s Capstone report.

8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera
systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to
record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system
functionality checks.

As discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels
of leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s
death, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis
to ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2019, video from approximately half
of the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for

days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera
systems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure
the camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video
streams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can
potentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that
the BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security
camera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct
periodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action
as soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable. Such routine checks would help ensure that
camera system malfunctions are detected and corrective actions are initiated in a timely manner.

INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION
ta
FROM: Colette 8. Peters, Director
SUBJECT: Response to the Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) Draft Report:

Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Custody, Care,
and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
in New York, New York

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the
Inspector General's (OIG) above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the
facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the
recommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this
engagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.

The facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this
report reflect a failure to follow BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While
this misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very
small percentage of the approximately 35,000 employees across more than 120 institutions who
continue to strive for correctional excellence every day.

In the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve
accountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office

(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen
employee accountability.

OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,
New York

June 22, 2023

Page 2 of 3

In April of this year, BOP’s leadership announced tts new mission as "corrections professionals
who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals
for successful reentry into our communities." BOP’s new core values include accountability,
integrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence. Of note, our core value of
accountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,
ourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,
and the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is committed to
providing a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.

Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the
particular individual or security considerations.

BOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in
custody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.
Our practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved
and overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP
has updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s
revised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists
make individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up and other custodial
concerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees
work collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed
appropriately.

Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate
re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security
considerations.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to
Recommendation 1, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological
observation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.
Upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care
recommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP
thoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at
moderate to high risk for suicide.

Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and
provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to
mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological
observation.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods
through policy, training, or other measures.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when
conducting a round.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address
staffing shortages at its prisons.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Hiring and retaining qualified
personnel is a key priority and BOP has developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach
that involves enhanced recruitment efforts and appropriate incentives. While the issues raised in
the OIG’s report were the result of employees failing to adhere to their duties, as opposed to a
staffing shortage, the BOP welcomes the opportunity to continue the significant work that has
already been undertaken and that is ongoing regarding staffing.

Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes
as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system
functionality checks.

BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

The BOP appreciates OIG’s careful attention to this engagement, and its willingness to provide
specific, feasible recommendations that address the root causes of issues raised in the incident

described. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this report. We look forward to
working with OIG to close these recommendations.

Appendix B: OIG Analysis of the BOP’s Response

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided a draft of this report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP), and the BOP’s response is incorporated as Appendix A. The BOP indicated in its response that it
agreed with all eight recommendations.

The following provides the OIG’s analysis of the BOP’s response and a summary of the actions necessary to
close the recommendations. The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response
to the recommendations within 90 days of the issuance of this report.

Recommendation 1: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide
watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or
security considerations.

Status: Resolved.
BOP Response: The BOP reported the following:

OIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is responsive to this recommendation. The OIG will consider whether to
close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides for the OIG's review a proposed process for assigning
a cellmate following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the
particular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2)
implements the process.

Recommendation 2: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide
and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-
assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security
considerations.

individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody. Upon removal from
suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care recommendations are made
by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP thoroughly evaluates each
celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at moderate to high risk
for suicide.

OIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is not fully responsive to this recommendation. Recommendation 1
focuses on the process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch and psychological observation.
Recommendation 2, on the other hand, focuses on procedures to ensure that inmates at high risk for
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended continue to have a cellmate until the recommendation is
changed or rescinded. Our investigation and review determined that BOP employees did not take steps to
ensure that Jeffrey Epstein continuously had a cellmate in response to Psychology Department personnel
having determined that he needed to have an appropriate cellmate, and absent any indication that security
or other considerations relating to Epstein warranted his not having a cellmate.

The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) develops the recommended
procedures; (2) provides the procedures to the OIG; and (3) implements the procedures.

Recommendation 3: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting
approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation,
which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and provide guidance on standard
components that each institution should include in its process to mitigate security issues that can
arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation.

Status: Resolved.
BOP Response: The BOP reported the following:

OIG Analysis: The BOP concurred with this recommendation but did not provide any additional
information. The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) evaluates the
current process for obtaining and documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on

institution should include it is process; and (3) provides to the OIG documentation of the evaluation and the
guidance forwarded to institutions for inclusion in their institution-specific processes.

and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods through policy,
training, or other measures.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

June 27, 2023

DO OIG Releases Report on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan

Correctional Center in New York, New York

Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today the release of a report
of investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey
Epstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New

York). Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019 while in BOP custody. The focus of DO] Office of the
Inspector General’s (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel.

The DO] OIG investigation and review identified:

e Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff. The DO) OIG found numerous and serious
failures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties. Among other
things, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive
amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in
his locked cell on August 10 at approximately 6:30 a.m.

°

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Following a July 23,
2019, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York
Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate
cellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York
staff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was
assigned a new cellmate.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein
and Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit
(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,
and ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s
death failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was
documented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when
Epstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would
have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG
also found that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds after about 10:40 p.m. on
August 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:00 p.m. on
August 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to show that they had been
performed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his

death. Following a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged
criminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the
employees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. That office declined prosecution for

other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier
dates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.

o MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully
Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to
ensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review
revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although
video cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies
resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to
not record video starting in late July 2019 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.

e Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing
operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and
securely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing
inmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,
and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during
this investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most
high profile inmates.

e No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with
Epstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP
personnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal
conduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s
death and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined
MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not
uncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in
connection with Epstein’s death.

The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s
custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only
because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to
questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous
victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures
have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for
DO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.

The DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional
institutions. The BOP agreed with all recommendations.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

“A Message from the Inspector General: Investigation and Review on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and
Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York,” June
2023

Hello, I'm Michael Horowitz, Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Justice.

Today my office released a report on the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or BOP’s, custody, care, and supervision
of inmate Jeffrey Epstein at the MCC New York. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanged in his locked
cell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner determined that Epstein died by suicide.

Today's report follows numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified
long-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely
and securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job
performance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;
and deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at
risk for suicide.

For example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as
instructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department following an incident on July 23" where Epstein was
found unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC
New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were
accounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's
cell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and
clothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system
was fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.

While we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence
contradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with how Epstein died.

The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s
custody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him
with the opportunity to take his own life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not
adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the
circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the
opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.

The fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and
gives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.

Washington, B. C, 20530

February 27,2025

Dear Director Patel,

Before you came into. office, I requested the full and complete files related’ to Jeffrey
Epstein, In response to this requést, I received approximately 200 pages of documents, which
consisted primarily of flight logs, Epstein’s:-list of contacts, and a list.of victims’ names and
phone numbers,

I repeatedly questioned whether this was the full set of documents responsive to my
request and was repeatedly assured by the. FBI that we had received the full set of documents.
Late yesterday, I learned froma source that the FBI Field Office in New York was in possession
of thousands of pages of documents related to the investigation and indictment of Epstein.
Despite my repeated requests, the FBI never discloséd the existence of these files. When you
and I spoke yesterday, you Werte just-as surprised as Iwas to learn this new information.

By 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, February 28; the FBI will deliver the full and complete Epstein
files to my office, including all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials
related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained.
There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your decess. The Department-of ‘Justice:
will ensure that any public disclosure of these files will be done in a mariner to. protect the
privacy of victims.dnd in accordance with law, as I have doné my entire career as a prosecutor.

I am also directing you to. conduct. an immediate vestigation into why my order to the
FBI was not followed. You will deliver tome a comprehensive report of your findings and
proposed personnel action within 14 days.

I appreciate your immediate attention to this important matter. 1 kiiow that we are both
committed to transparency for the American people, and I look forward to continuing to work
with you to serve our President and our country.

... This graph is pretty explosive: A person with knowledge of the investigation said that when the decision was made to remove Mr.
Epstein from suicide watch, the jail informed the Justice Department that Mr. Epstein would have a cellmate and that a guard “would

look into his cell” every 30 minutes.

But that was apparently not done, the person said.

Inmate Death at the MCC New York

New York, NY: On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:30 a.m., inmate Jeffrey
Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent
suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Life-saving
measures were initiated immediately by responding staff. Staff requested emergency medical
services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local
hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital
staff. The FBI is investigating the incident.

Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under
pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.

MCC New York is an Administrative security facility that currently houses 763 male offenders
in New York, New York.

Additional information about the Federal Bureau of Prisons can be found at www.bop.gov.

Inmate Death at the MCC New York

New York, NY: On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:30 a.m., inmate Jeffrey
Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent
suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Life-saving
measures were initiated immediately by responding staff. Staff requested emergency medical
services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local
hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital
staff. The FBI is investigating the incident.

Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under
pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.

MCC New York is an Administrative security facility that currently houses 763 male offenders
in New York, New York.

Hi—

(TIVO from the Washington Post here. We are in the process of working on a story about the
cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein’s cell on the morning of his death. The story will assert that the data in
those cameras was found to be corrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further

analysis.

Can the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC?
Are you able to say what other cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that
Mr. Epstein killed himself?

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines

and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi Darrin

At Judge Berman's invitation, | went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the
government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023559.jpg
----------------------------------------
Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were “all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a
particular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel

obviously didn't know that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go
to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement.
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC
with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. | won't rehash the
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and
ended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; | verbally updated him, but he may need to
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Friday with OO Si Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be

allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday,
Office} old my client and | that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [Gar Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,

not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines

and no proper meal.

Good afternoon Mr.


Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi Darri eave

At Judge Berman's invitation, | went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the
government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

(b)(5)

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a
particular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel

obviously didn't know that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go
to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement.
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC
with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. | won't rehash the
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and
ended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; | verbally updated him, but he may need to
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

I left you a voicemail, but wanted to follow up via email as well.

Our Regional Office reminded me that we need a written request from your office to
produce the documents you seek. It does not have to be a subpoena. An email from

you requesting the investigation documentation will suffice.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a

intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the

Good afternoon Mr Oey |

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES’ FUNDS

If an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be
distributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state. If the
inmate dies with monies due from the United States, payment is not authorized except to a legal
representative of the estate or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution of the state of
domicile (most recent legal residence).

a. Claims for Funds of Deceased Inmates. Claims received against funds of deceased inmates
are handled at the institution level per 4 GAO 3500. Institutions should submit claims to the Trust
Fund Branch Deposit Fund Section for GAO settlement only when doubt exists as to:

m= The amount or validity of the claim.
= The person(s) properly entitled to payment under the laws of the domicile of the descendent.

In such cases, the institution transmittal shall explain that doubt exists, and is accompanied by a
Claim Against the United States for Amounts Due in the Case of A Deceased Creditor (SF-1055)
and/or Acknowledgment of Inmate, Part 3 & 4 (BP-A0408) and a copy of the death certificate.

If there is urgent need for payment of a balance under $100 in a deceased inmate's account, and if
conditions as outlined in the paragraph above are satisfied, the amount may be disbursed from
TRUFACS with the Trust Fund Branch Chief's written approval. Copies of the BP-A0408 are
attached to such vouchers in lieu of the usual withdrawal request. Documentation is attached to
the payment in TRUFACS through the document imaging process.

b. Unclaimed Funds of Deceased Inmates. Procedures for processing “whereabouts
unknown” inmates are followed when disposing unclaimed funds of deceased inmates with no
relatives or claimants for the funds.

8.8 ENCUMBRANCE OF INMATE FUNDS

Encumbrance of inmate funds for various reasons is essential. Careful consideration is given
before any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately. An encumbrance may be made
for various reasons (e.g. to ensure inmates do not seriously deplete their funds before release,
disciplinary measures, inmate’s request, claims). Encumbrances are at the Warden’s discretion or
the result of a disciplinary hearing sanction or notification of a pending Federal court order. This
authority is not delegated below the Associate Warden. Funds the Warden encumbers may only
be released upon his/her approval or upon inmate release.

Attachments: TEXT htm

Hi Darri

At Judge Berman's invitation, | went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the
government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

b)(5)

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a
particular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel

obviously didn't know that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go
to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

METADATA_SOURCE: .
METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023659.jpg
----------------------------------------
The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement.
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC
with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. | won't rehash the
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and
ended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; | verbally updated him, but he may need to
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Thanks,

Good afternoon Mr era

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Friday with OR nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday,

come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant{@ipr Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,
no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines
and no proper meal.

Good afternoon Mr SS)

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

With apologies for the delay, medical staff can accept his CPAP machine. Would you or one of your

Good morning Mr

| tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last
Friday wit nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday,
Officer told my client and | that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant{@i@iljor Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,
no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines
and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Good morning Mr.

| tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last
Friday with®@i® MO pnd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday,
OfficerIOMtold my client and | that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [Mi@ior Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,
no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines
and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

IIT. PRETRIAL DETENTION

McC New York staff are aware of the importance of the
institution’s pretrial detention mission. MCC New York staff
are expected to act in a professionali manner and are governed by
a code of employee conduct. Attorneys who feel that they have
been treated unprofessionaliy by a staff member are asked to put
their complaint in writing to the Warden's Office, MCC New York,
150 Park Row, New York, NY 10007. All complaints will be looked
inte and appropriate action will be taken if necessary.

In turn, our staff appreciate the professionalism and courtesy
expected from attorneys and other officers of the court.
Attorneys are expected not only to abide by the Attorney Guide,
but generally to act in a professional manner. In addition, ail
visitors are expected to refrain from using profanity and keep
their voices at a conversational level when speaking with staff,
inmates and other visitors. All visitors, inciuding attorneys,
are prohibited from using cell phones within the institution,
including the Lobby.

All visitors, ineluding attorneys, who violate MCC New York's
visiting rules, create disturbances at the institution or in any
way jeopardize the security or orderly operation of the
institution may have their visiting privileges restricted or
suspended,

The information contained in this Guide is meant to be a general
guideline and is not all-inclusive. We cannot envision every
elrcumstance that could occur, and thus the Guide does not
contain the answers to all questions. For example, in the event
ef an institution emergency, security needs of the institution
will override any portion of this Attorney Guide.

A. Legal Visiting

1. Visiting Hours

Legal visitation hours are as follows:

Monday-Sunday (including Federal Holidays) 8:00 a.m. - 7:00

p.m.
Visits during these hours do not need to be scheduled in advance.
Special legal visits outside of these hours may be requested
through MCC New York’s Legal Department with at least 24 hours
notice (The Legal Department is open Monday-Friday 7:30 a.m.-
4:00 p.m. so a request for Monday must be in by the preceding
Friday). Requests should be faxed to: “{646) 836-7665, Attn:
Legal Department.” Every effort will be made to accommodate
such requests, but final approval is contingent upon the

avaiiability of staff. In the event an attorney requires an
emergency visit outside normal legal visiting hours and has not
pre-requested it, he/she must contact the Operations Lieutenant.

If there is any problem with a legal visit during off duty hours,
attorneys should ask to speak with the Institution Duty Officer

or Operations Lieutenant.

2. Attorney Processing

MCC New York conducts a daily count of all inmates at 4:00 p.m.,
with an additional count at 10:00 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and
federal holidays. Additional unscheduled counts may also occur
in emergencies. During a count, inmates must be at their
assigned ceil or bunk, unless the inmate has heen authorized to
be in another area. In order to guarantee an accurate count, a
reguest that an inmate remain in the visiting room during the
count must be made at least one hour before the count, 1.6.,
3:00 poem. for the 4:00 p.m. count and 9:00 a.m. for the 10:00
a.m. count. When this approval is granted, the inmate is placed
on the “out count” and will be required to remain in the
visiting room until the count has been completed. Inmates who
have not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal
visits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:30 p.m. and
9:30 a.m. Attorneys who arrive at the institution within an
hour before the start of a count, i-.e., after 3:00 p.m. or 9:00
a.m., will not be able to visit thear client until after the
count clears.

Counts usually take approximately 30-40 minutes to clear. During
this time, all movement in the institution ceases. Conseguently,
attorneys and/or their representatives will not be allowed to
enter or exit the Visiting Room during official counts. Visits
should be scheduled accordingly to avoid unnecessary delays.

3. Identification

To receive attorney entrance privileges, an individual must he
able to establish his or her status as an attorney by presenting
identification that verifies active membership in any state bar.
Excluding Legal Aid Society Federal Defender’s, NY State
Attorneys are required to have a Secure Pass Identification card
for entrance. Upon notification that a NY State attorney is not
in possession of a Secure Pass, and upon approval from the Legal
Department, attorneys will be permitted to enter the institution
for 650 days from their date of approval without the Secure Pass.

If an attorney is licensed in a state other than New York,
he/she must contact the legal department at least 24 hours in
advance so that their status as an attorney in good standing may
be verified. Provided the Legal Department can verify the
attorney’s status, the attorney will be added on a list located
in the lobby, authorizing the attorney’s entrance for a one year

period with government issued picture identification, such as a
drivers license. It is ultimately the attorney’s responsibility
to establish his or her membership in a State Bar.

After completing the Notification to Visitor form, attorneys must
be processed through the metal detector, have their hand stamped
and sign the bound logbook before being allowed entry into the
institution. By signing the Notification to Visitor forms,
attorneys certify that they are not carrying firearms,
explosives, weapons, ammunition, metal cutting tools, recording
equipment, cellular phones, cameras, food items, narcotics,
marijuana, alcoholic beverages, prescription drugs or any other
item deemed contraband. All legal materials and briefcases will
be searched for contraband and processed through the flucoroscope.
Handbags, newspapers, portable telephones, and non-legal
materials are not permitted in the Visiting Room.

Official Visitors: Federal employees, including Assistant U.S.
Attorneys, law enforcement officers, U.S. Court officials, U.S.
Probation Officers, and Assistant Federal Public Defenders, will
be permitted to visit upon presentation of appropriate
identification. All visitors must present official
identification, sign in and out of the logbook, and pass through
the metal detector.

a, Property Brought into the Visiting Room

Legal Material

An attorney may bring into the visiting room legal materials
related to an inmate’s case, including CDs, or audio/videotapes
as well as dollar bills for the vending machines. An attorney
{not a paralegal, investigator, mitigation specialist or
interpreter) will be authorized to provide a reasonable (not

to exceed four inches) amount of legal materials to the inmate at
the conclusion of the attorney visit. The inmate will be allowed
to take these legal materials with him/her to his/her unit after
the Officer determines the items are of a legal nature and he/she
inspects them for contraband. Legal materials should not be read
for content but examined only to determine that they are indeed
legal materials and they are free of contraband. Inmates housed
in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) will be allowed to take legal
materials to their unit minus folders, paperclips, staples,
rubber bands, or any other items that could be

considered a security concern. All other materials, including
celliuiar phones, pagers, newspapers, magazines, tissues, wallets
and keys, are prohibited and must be secured in a lobby locker
before entering the secure confines of the institution.

Additionally, legal videos, CDs and audio tapes, cannot be
provided to an inmate during a legal visit but may be placed in

the Lobby legal mail drop box for delivery to the inmate. Mail
deposited in these boxes must be smaii enough to fit through the

opening of the box. Larger packages may be broken down into
several smalier envelopes. These boxes are emptied Monday-
Friday, excluding federal holidays, and the contents are
processed with other mail received from the post office that
day. Envelopes must be ciearly marked with the attorney’s name
(including language that identifies that person as an attorney),
inmate’s name and register number and the following statement:
“SPECIAL MAIL-OPEN ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE INMATE.” See
below, page 12. Unauthorized items found in the inmate’s
possession will be treated as contraband.

Tape Players, VCRs & Computers to Review Discovery Material

Due to security concerns, attorneys may not bring electronic
eguipment into the secure confines of the institution. However,
MCC New York has tape players, VCRs and televisions for
attorneys to review discovery materials with clients in visiting
rooms. These items are available on a first come, first served
basis by oral request to the visiting room officer.

MCC New York also has a computer that attorneys may use to
review computer CDs with their clients. The computer is
available during attorney visiting hours and should be reserved
at least 24 hours in advance by calling the Legal Department.
Attorneys who make an appointment to use the computer will have
preference over those who do not make an appointment. Attorneys
should bring a copy of the CD discovery when meeting with an
inmate.

Audio and video cassettes and CDs may also be mailed directly to
an inmate via the legal mail procedures explained below in the
Legal Mail section, Cl. Inmates may review their DVD and CD-Rom
discovery material as described in the Law Library Section, El.

5. Private Conference Rooms

These rooms are available on a first come, first served basis.
There are twelve conference rooms in the building. Institutioral
security and fire safety regulations restrict the total number
of people that may be in the visiting room at any one time.
Ultimately, it is a correctional decision where any visit will
take place.

6. Multipie Client Visits

Attorneys are not limited in the number of inmates they may
Visit in one day. However, only one inmate may be brought down
to the visiting room at any time. Please see below in
Separation/Codefendant Meeting Section 11 for instruction on Co-
Defendant Meetings. When an attorney has finashed the legal
visit and the inmate has been sent back to the unit, another
inmate may be brought down to the visiting room.

Approved legal representatives (law clerk, paralegal,
interpreter, investigator, psychologist, and other experts} may
accompany an attorney into the Visiting Room. If visiting
independently, representatives must follow the requirements set
forth in the “Legal Representatives” section below. See Section
8.

Attorneys are ordinarily not permitted to bring material
witnesses into the Visiting Room. Prior approval to do soa must
be received from the Warden and requires a court order. Written
requests for such approval should clearly outline the specific
clrcumstances requiring this type of visit. Visits will not be
approved if alternative arrangements are avallable to defense
counsel.

7. Dress Code

All visitors, including attorneys, are required to dress ina
manner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively
provocative, immodest or revealing attire is reason to deny
visiting. Visitors over the age of 12 will not be aliowed into
the institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses
exceeding three inches above the kneecap in length. See-through
clothing, halter-tops, tube tops, tank tops, any top that
reveals the midriff area, low-cut shirts or blouses, revealing
front and/or backless clothing, skin-tight ciothing, spandex
clothing and sweat pants are not allowed. Furthermore, clothing
which may impede identification (e.g., hoods) or easily hide
contraband (e.9g., coats) present security concerns and are also
prohibited. All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shower
shoes, flip-fiops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind)
and undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has
delegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision—
making authority regarding what attire is appropriate inside the
Visating Room. If the Buty Officer is not available, the
Operations Lieutenant will make the final decision. A
memorandum containing clothing guidelines is posted in the lobby
of MCC New York. It is the responsibility of visitors to
familiarize themselves with this memo and watch for updates.

8. Leqal Representatives

Attorneys are allowed to visit their clients upon providing
evidence of their professional status. However, attorneys often
need other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters,
mitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their
clients in connection with legal representation. These
individuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to
attorneys and must first submit an application (See ATTACHMENT
A) signed by a sponsoring attorney and pass a background check
before being granted permission to enter MCC New York.

Once approved, the individual will be included on a list
maintained in the lobby and allowed to enter the institution for
one year with appropriate government issued IB. The entry
application may be requested from and mailed to the Legal
Departments of either MCC New York or MDC Brooklyn. Once
approved the individual may enter both institutions.

For mitigation specialists, every time they visit the
institution For a new inmate, they must submit a court order to
the Legal Department which authorizes them to enter the
institution to visit with that specific inmate. Upon reapplying
at the end of their one year entry period, mitigation
specialists and doctors are required to produce a new order,
reflecting the new year.

9, Polygraphs

The Warden may permit polygraph tests in connection with state or
federal criminal felony investigations. See 28 C.F.R. $551.71.
Polygraph tests in connection with misdemeanor offenses, civil
proceedings, or any other matters are generally disapproved,
absent a federal court order. See Id. Requests for polygraph
examinations must be submitted to the Legal Department with
approval by the Warden. The written request should include at
least the following information:

Inmate’s name and register number;

Case caption, case number and nature of matter;
Requested date and time;

Expected length of polygraph;

Name, title, and organization of each person

attending (all non-attorneys and non-legal
representatives will have to fill out an application soa
MCC can complete a background check (See ATTACHMENT B);
(6) List of all equipment to be used; and

(7) Indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been
obtained.

The Warden must be able to confirm the validity of the request
and the inmate being examined must give written consent on a form
provided for that purpose. Requesters are responsible for
meeting all state and local requirements in administering the
test.

1o0. Depositions

Requests for Depositions for state matters, both civil and
criminal, must be submitted to the Legal Department for review.
All deposition requests must be made in writing and include the
following information:

Video or tape recorders are not allowed inside the institution.
Furthermore, all equipment is subject to inspection prior to
entering the institution.

11. Sevaration Assignments/Co-Defendant Meetings

Co-defendant meetings must be requested at least 24 hours in
advance of the meeting, e.g. for a meeting on Tuesday at 2:00
P.M., the request must be submitted by Monday at 2:00 P.M.
Written requests shoula be faxed to the MCC New York Legal
Department, (646) 836-7665, and should include the names of
everyone attending the meeting, including, but not limited ta,
attorneys, paralegals, interpreters, investigators, co-defendants
on bail and co-defendants at MCC New York. Please indicate which
attorney represents each inmate. Also, please include with the
request a copy of the first page of the indictment showing that
the requested parties are co-defendants. This must be provided
every time a meeting is requested.

Separation Orders: An inmate with a “separation order” is
prohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or
she is separated. Such a restriction would normally prevent a
co-defendant meeting. Ordinarily, the request can be

accommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies
the institution that the separation does not apply to co-
defendant meetings. However, if the inmates have been separated
due to security concerns, whether based on information developed
by an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the
discretion to not allow the meeting. Attorneys who are aware of
separation orders between co-defendants should include with their
request the name and phene number of the AUSA assigned to the
case in question. These requests should be made as far in
advance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the
responsible Assistant United States Attorney cannot be contacted.

For co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from
McC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the
responsibility of the defense attorney to contact the responsible
Assistant United States Attorney, who will, in turn, contact the
USMS to arrange transportation of the inmate. The Bureau of
Prisons does not transport inmates for co-defendant meetings.

The request for the meeting should be sent to both MCC and MDC
Legal Departments. MDC Brooklyn’s Legal Department fax number is
(718) 840-4250.

12. Foreign Attorneys

Attorneys who are not licensed in a state or jurisdiction of the
United States must provide verification of their status as a
licensed attorney in good standing in a foreign jurisdiction,
prior to their initial visit. Foreign attorneys should contact
their respective Consulate Office, who will provide the attorney
official documentation (raised seal for most countries) stating
that the individual is in fact an attorney in good standing in
that country. The attorney must provide to the MCC New York
Legal Department, the original letter from his or her consulate
verifying the foreign attorney’s status as a licensed attorney
in good standing. Once the status of the foreign attorney has
been confirmed, that attorney will be processed as a legal
visitor for future visits for one year only. The attorney may
request to be placed on the list on an annual basis by following
the above described procedure.

B. Telephone Calls

lee Unmonitored Telephone Calls

Inmates may place unmonitored telephone calls to their attorneys.
See 28 C.F.R. §540.105; and Program Statement 5264.07, Sec.8,
elephone Regulations for Inmates. All housing units, excluding
Special Housing Unit (SHU), have access to unmonitored telephones
with a direct connection to the SDNY Federal Public Defenders’
Office. Some units also have unmonitored telephones with a
direct connection to the EDNY Federal Public Defenders’ Office.
If the inmate’s attorney cannot be contacted on the provided
telephones, the inmate must specifically request Unit Team staff
assistance in writing. The Unit Team staff will review the
request, and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit
Team’s unmonitored telephones. In order to receive an
unmonitored attorney call, the inmate or the inmate’s attorney
must request Unit Team approval, demonstrating that other
correspondence, visiting, and normal telephone use is inadequate.

Inmate requests for unmonitored attorney calls are carefully
reviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected.
Frequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate’s
opportunity to pursue illegal activities without detection.
Additionally, staff time and attention is unfairly focused on the
single inmate receiving numerous unmonitored telephone calls at
the expense of the many other inmates on a caseload.

----------------------------------------
An attorney may not call an inmate. Attorneys who need to speak
with an inmate and do not anticipate that the inmate will call
them must visit the inmate in person or contact the inmate by
letter. Similarly, attorneys may not fax documents to inmates
or to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.

2. Inmates Telephone System (1TS}

The Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as
part of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28
C.F.R. §3540.100, et seq., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for
Inmate; and Program Statement 5264.07, Telephone Regulations for
Inmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of
Maintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an
inmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a
person of his or her choice outside the institution on a
telephone provided for that purpose. However, limitations and
conditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges
to ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional
INManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set
forth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those
limitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure
the security or good order, including discipline, of the
institution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate
telephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.
See 28 C.F.R. Part 541.

Inmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on
their approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers
placed on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits
the initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.
Inmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are
assiqned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit
Team.

Inmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring
capability. See 28 C.F.R. $540,102. A notice is posted next to
each inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.
Ordinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases
the receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §540.105. Third party,
conference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or
other alternative call arrangements are not permitted, thus
limiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for
criminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the
telephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which
may result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases
criminal charges.

Inmates may place attorneys on their approved telephone list.
However, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such
calls are not attorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking
attorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored
telephone call as described above in section B{l).

3. Emergency Telephone Calls

Inmates requiring an emergency social phone call que to 4 death
or serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a
request to the Religious Services Department. Likewise, if an
individual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons, they
should call the main number and ask to speak to the Religious
Services Department.

C. Legal Mail

All legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail
addressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to
sender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.

1. Leqal Mail Envelopes:

The Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may
receive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 540.18; and
Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 5800.10, Mail Management
Manual (“PS 5800.10"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides
that special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of
the inmate, will be treated as such “if the sender is adequately
identified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is
marked ‘Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the
inmate.’" 28 C.F.R. § 540.18 (a). However, the presence of a
return address with a firm name does not suffacientiy identify
the sender of the material as an attorney.

Specifically, the attorney must be adequately
identified on the envelope as an attorney . . . The
use of the title "Esquire" without additional
indication of the sender's occupation does not
establish the bearer as an attorney or legal aid
supervisor. Mail from individuals using the title
"Esquire" as the exclusive identification of their
status shall not be handled as special mail, even if
the envelope contains some special mail markings.

P.S. 5800.16, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handiing of
legal mail, strict compliance with these procedures wiil be
enforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify
legai mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm's
name) and their legal status (i.e., attorney), in the return
address portion of the envelope. This information, in addition
to writing elsewhere on the envelope “Speciai Mail —- Open oniy
in presence of inmate,” will ensure that legal mail is treated
as confidential attorney-client communication.

----------------------------------------
2. Leqal Mail Packages:

Bureau of Prisons policy requires that incoming inmate property
packages be authorized in advance unless otherwise approved
under another Bureau policy. Packages containing only legal
material do not need to be pre-approved; however:

packages must be marked with words such as ‘Authorized
by Bureau Policy.’ This is to alert mail room staff
that enclosed materials contain matter which does not
require prior approval. .. . <A package received
Without an appropriately completed [authorization
form], or without markings indicating authorized
materials enclosed, is considered unauthorized and
shall be returned to the sender.

PS 5800.10, Ch. 3, pp.8-9.

This additional marking, 1.e., “Authorized by Bureau Policy,” is
only required on packages and should be in addition to the legal
mail markings explained above. Any legal mail that is delivered
in a box, a padded envelope or is wrapped in shipping paper 1s
considered a package and wili be handled pursuant to the above
policy. An attorney who is unsure whether a legal shipment wili
be considered a package or an envelope should write “Authorized
by Bureau Policy” to ensure that the shipmert is not rejected.

(Note: An inmate who wishes to receive a non-legal material
package from anyone, including an attorney, must contact a2
member of the Unit Team to complete the appropriate paperwork
and receive approval.)

3, FedEx:

Attorneys should not send packages via FedEx because no inmate
mail is received directly at MCC New York. Staff pick up all
inmate mail at the United States Post Office. FedEx will only
deliver to the actuai prison and staff are prohibited from
receiving a package for an inmate that is hand-delivered ta MCC
New York. Attorneys who wish to expedite the delivery of
documents or materials to their clients are advised to pass them
during a legal visit, place the materials in one of the
institution’s legal drop boxes or send the materials via the
Postal Service’s Express or Priority Mail services.

4, Stamps

Inmates may not receive stamps or stamped items other than
issuance from the institution or by purchase from the commissary.
C.F.R. §540.21(4). These items will be treated as contraband

in the institution. Attorneys are permitted to send self-
addressed envelope without affixed postage.

5. Court Clothing

Court clothing for trial can be delivered in one of two ways:

1) Prior to an individual bringing in clothes, it is the
inmate’s responsibility to submit an “Authorization to Receive A
Package or Property BP-331" to his Unit Counselor. This form
can be obtained from the inmate’s Unit Team. The Unit Counselor
will then deliver one copy of that form to the Receiving and
Discharge (R&D) Department. The inmate wili receive the other
copies of that form so that he may mail one to the individual
who will be dropping off the court clothes. The individual
bringing the clothing should call R&D staff in advance before
dropping off clothes. Once authorized, they must bring the copy
of the BP-331 form with the package and notify the iobby officer
who will contact a staff member from the R&D department. An R&D
staff member will then report to the lobby and accept the
clothing.

2) A court order can be obtained in lieu of the BP-331 form
mentioned above. A call to R&D in advance of dropping the
clothing must still be made. Inmates are allowed up to two sets
of trial clothes.

6. Mail for multiple defendants

If a case involves several co-defendants who will need to view
the same discovery material, the package/envelope of discovery
must be addressed te the Legal Department, as described above,
and the mailing must contain @ cover letter indicating all
inmates and Register Numbers who are to have access to this
discovery material.

D. Release of Records/Information

1. Subpoenas

subpoenas for documents may be faxed to the MCC New York Legal
Department at (646) 836-7665. Upon receipt of the fax, MCC New
York will begin gathering the requested documents. Please be
advised that the Privacy Act prohibits the release of any
information pursuant to a subpoena without the written
permission of the individual to whom the records pertain. This
requirement applies to attorneys requesting decuments about
their clients. Therefore, an attorney must provide an original
signed consent for release of information from his or her client
along with any subpoena for information. Any records to which
an inmate normally has access, i.e., the inmate’s medical
records and central file, will be provided directly to the

requesting attorney with the proper inmate consent. However,
all other subpoenaed records will be provided to the United
States Attorney’s Office for a determination of whether to
release the documents, pursuant to the Touhy regulations, 28
C.F.R. § 16.213 et seq.

2. Medical Records

Medical records may be obtained by defense counsel with a Consent
to Release Authorization signed by the inmate-the original
consent form is required. The request can be mailed to the Legal
Department. If the inmate is no longer assigned to MCC New York,
then the requesting attorney must file a FOIA request toe the
following address:

Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Section
Office of General Counsel, Room 841

Federal Bureau of Prisons

320 First Street, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20534

Health Services staff are not at liberty to discuss information
with an inmate’s attorney related to that inmate’s medical
condition. Attorneys are encouraged to seek such information
directly from their clients.

If a newly arriving inmate has prior non-Bureéau medical records,
you may send the materials to MCC New York, ATTN: Health Services
Unit.

E. Inmate Legal Activities

1. Law Library

The law library at MCC New York consistsof legal books, electric
typewriters, and computers on which inmates may access and view
discovery material on CD-ROM format. The Education Department
also provides copy machines for inmates to use in preparing any
legal documents.

Typically, inmates at MCC New York may access the law library
during their scheduled law library hours, which are one day a
week, Monday through Thursday. Inmates should check the bulletin
boards in their respective housing units for days and times
scheduled. Inmates may sign up to access the law library between
the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 10:40 a.m., and from 12:30 p.m.
through 3:30 p.m. Since MCC New York is a high-rise building,
each floor is allowed access to the law library one day per week
because many of the inmates must be separated from each other at
all times for security purposes. In addition, inmates who are
pro se or who have a demonstrated legal need, such as an imminent

court deadline or an excessive amount of discovery material to

----------------------------------------
review, may be granted an additional six hours of library time on
Fridays by making a request to the Education Department. All
requests for additional law library time are, of course, subject
to staff availability, number of inmate requests, and security
concerns. If the pretrial inmate is pro se, as in representing
his/herself, the inmate should provide the Education Department
with official court documentation verifying his/her status.

There is also a basic law library in the Special Housing Unit
(SHU).

If the law library does not have the reference material the
inmate needs to do the research, the inmate may consult with the
Education Department staff on the possibility of requesting
additional materials.

2. Access to Computerized Discovery Materials

McC New York’s law library has computers which inmates may access
during their scheduled law library hours.

All electronic discovery materials must be sent in CD-ROM formats

instead of DVD disks. MCC New York currently does not have the
equipment to support DVDs. Material from DVD disks should be
broken down and distributed onto several CDs. MCC New York

computers have the capability to play industry standard audio or
video files in the following formats:

l. video clips of AVI, MPG, MPEG, WMV
2. audio clips of WAV, MP3, WMA
3. documents in PDF form, HTML, TXT, JPG, DOC

Due toe licensing issues, MCC New York does not support RealPlayer
recorded audio or video formats, CD-RW disks, files made for a
non-Microsoft computer {such as MacIntosh) or discovery in non-
standard/proprietary format.

3. Leisure Library

All housing units have been assigned a time for utilizing the
leisure library. Inmates should check the unit bulletin board
for days and times scheduled.

4, Service of Process

Bureau staff are prohibited from effecting service of process on

inmates. MCC New York policy requires that an inmate be served
by a federal, state or local law enforcement official (Marshals
or Sheriffs). Because service of process occurs within the

secure confines of the institution, private process servers, who
are not also law enforcement officials, may not serve inmates.
The qualified process server must contact MCC New York’s Inmate
Systems Management department to schedule an appointment before
coming to the institution.

----------------------------------------
F. Administrative Remedy Program

It is imperative that inmates attempt to resolve any condition of
confinement issues internally either by speaking to appropriate
staff or through the Administrative Remedy Process. Further, all
housing units have bulletin boards that have information
explaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions,
etc.

The Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Program is a process through
which inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to
virtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures
have not resolved the matter. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 -
Administrative Remedy; and Program Statement 1330.13,
Administrative Remedy Program. This program applies as follows:
{1} to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of
Prisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract
Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally known as Community
Corrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and
(3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their
confinement. See C.F.R. §542.10.

Inmates are obligated to attempt informal resolution of
grievances prior to filing a formal request for administrative
remedy. See 28 C.F.R. $542.13. The deadline for completion of
informal resolution and submission of a formal written
Administrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 20
calendar days following the date on which the basis for the
Request occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.14. Once an inmate has
filed a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the
Warden of that facility has 20 calendar days to investigate and
provide the inmate a written response. See 28 C.F.R. §542.18.
If the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden’s response, he/she
has 20 calendar days to file a Regional Administrative Remedy

Appeal (BP-10). See 28 C.F.R. §542.15. Once received in the
Regional Office, the Regional Director has 30 calendar days ta
investigate and provide the inmate a written response. See 28

C.F.LR. $542.18. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional
Director’s response, he/she has 30 calendar days to file a
Central Office Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-11). See 28
C.FLR. $15. Once received in the Central Office, the
Administrator, National Inmate Appeals, has 40 days to
investigate and provide the inmate a written response. 28 C.F.R.
§542.18. After receiving the Administrator’s response, the
inmate has exhausted the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program.
The program provides for expedited investigations and responses
in emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both
filing grievances and receiving responses. At any level, an
Administrative Remedy may be rejected if it does not fully comply
with Program Statement 1330.13, Administrative Remedy Program.

----------------------------------------
Tf complaining about a sensitive issue, in the sense that the
inmate’s safety or well-being would be placed in danger if the
request became known at the institution, the inmate may submit
his administrative remedy directly to the appropriate Regional
Director, marking “Sensitive” upon the request and explaining, in
writing, the reason for not submitting the request at the
institution. See Program Statement 1330.13, Sec.8{d) (1),
Administrative Remedy Program. If the Regional Administrative
Remedy Coordinator agrees that the request is sensitive, the
request shall be accepted, investigated, and responded to.
Otherwise, the request will not be accepted, and the inmate will
be advised in writing of that determination, without return of
the request. The inmate may then pursue the matter by submitting
a request for Administrative Remedy locally to the Warden. The
Warden shall allow a reasonable extension of time for such a
resubmission. See 28 C.F.R. $542.17.

Special procedures regarding the appeal of Disciplinary Hearing
Officer (DHO) actions may be found at 28 C.F.R. §542.14(d) (2).
Appeals from DHOG actions shall be submitted initially to the
Regional Director for the region where the inmate is currently
located.

G. Inmate Designations

The majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates
who, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another
institution. However, an inmate is not transported to a new
institution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court
must first provide to the USMS the final presentence
investigation report and a signed judgement and commitment order.
The USMS must then forward these documents along with a request
for designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation
Center (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating
an institution for an inmate to serve 4a sentence, the Bureau
considers many factors, including but not limited to, the
security level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and
judicial recommendations. Once an institution has been
designated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or
airlift on which space is available. This entire process often
takes several weeks to complete. Contact information for DSCC is
as follows:

----------------------------------------
Court Ordered Studies

At anytime during an inmate’s pre-trial confinement, the judge
may order one of numerous studies found at 18 U.S.C. $4241 et

seq. Once a judge signs the request for designation, the court
must send a copy to the USMS and Probation who will then contact
Dbscc. Since the inmate is not sentenced, he is not yet in Bureau

custody, therefore the Bureau cannot make the designation without
an official request from the USMS to the Bureau in Grand Prairie.
Neither the Legal Department ner any institution staff have a
role in the process. It is up to the attorneys on the criminal
case to make sure the order is processed as described in this
paragraph. If questions arise, the attorneys may contact the
DSCC (contact info. above).

H. Health Services
1. Sick Call

Inmates are advised during their initial screening and physical
examination that if they wish to be evaluated by the Health
Services Department, they must submit @ sick call slip to the
department. It i858 imperative that inmate’s use this system, as
it helps the department track requests and have inmates seen on a4
first need to be seen basis. If an inmate has a verified chronic
condition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, etc.) he will be placed
in a chronic care clinic and scheduled for appointments
automatically.

Sick call slips are available on the housing units and there is a
sick call box on each unit in which to submit the slips. The
sick call box on each housing unit will be emptied daily by a
member of Health Services Staff and given to the medical staff
for triage. Requests will be prioritized in accordance with
greatest medical need. Inmates will be charged a $2.00 co-pay
fee for all non-chronic care, non-emergent appointments.

2. Emergency Care

Any time there is a medical emergency on a unit, the inmate
should notify the unit officer who can call the on-duty P.A.

3. Medication

With regards to medication, MCC New York staff will make every
effort to continue an inmate on a specific medication as long as
the inmate has proof that he is on that medication {a
prescription, a prescription bottle, ete.). However, for safety
of staff and other inmates, there are several medications that an
inmate may be on that are not on the national Bureau of Prisons
formulary. In this instance, if medical staff find it necessary
to prescribe a substitute medication, they will do se. If an
inmate is prescribed a medication that has refills, it is their
responsibility to notify the pharmacy when they need a refill.

METADATA_SOURCE: .
METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00023763.tif
----------------------------------------
This can be accomplished by placing the empty bottle on the daily
pill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least

once a day. If medical staff feel that an inmate should not he
in possession of certain medications they need (certain
psychiatric medications), the inmate will be administered the

medication by pharmacy during daily pill line.

4. Independent Medical Examinations (IME)

If an attorney seeks a court order for an IME, the following
information must be included:

{1) Inmate’s name and register number;

(2) A court order or similar court signea document for the
examination;

(3) A provision for time and date to be determined by all
affected parties;

{4) Expected length of examination;

(5) Name, title, and organization of each person attending

(all-non attorneys and non-legal representatives will
have to fill out an application so MCC can complete a
background check (See Attachment B);

(6) List of all equipment to be used; and
(7) An indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been
obtained.

All of the above should be faxed to the Legal Department who will
make arrangements with the medical department for a convenient
time and date. The physician entering will be subject to using
the equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also
have to complete Attachment B.

5. Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital

All USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will
be referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.

I. Special Housing Unit (SHU)

MCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general
population. The SHU consists of two categories of cells:
administrative detention and disciplinary segregation.

Disciplinary Segregation Status. A form of separation from the
general population in which inmates who commit serious violations
of Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,
for specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general
population. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary
segregation upon determining that no other available disposition
will adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence
necessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable
limits.

----------------------------------------
Administrative Detention Status. A non-punitive form of
separation from the general population used when the continued
presence of the inmate within the general population would pose a
serious threat to life, property, self, staff or other inmates,
or to the security or orderly running of the institution. This
housing status may also include inmates who require protective
custody, those who cannot be placed in local population because
they are en route to another institution (holdovers), and those
who are awaiting a hearing before the Unit Discipline Committee
or Discipline Hearing Officer. Program Statement 5270.07, Inmate

Discipline and Special Housing Units, found at Bureau’s public
website.

Additionally, all newly arriving inmates at MCC are placed in the
Special Housing Unit until they are screened and an appropriate
housing unit (general population or SHU) is determined.

J. Miscellaneous

1. Religious Programs
Title 28 C.F.R. §548, Religious Programs and Program Statement
5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices set forth the Bureau of
Prisons’ policy for inmates who wish to practice their religion
while incarcerated. Chaplains are available at all institutions.
See 28 C.F.R. $548.12. In addition, contract religious clergy
and volunteers from the community augment Bureau staff to make
available a wide variety of programs, including those involving
group worship, individual religions counseling, spiritual
guidance, and the study of sacred writings. See 28 C.F.R.
$548.14. Inmates must make all religious requests, including
common fare diets, through the Religious Services Department.

Peg Food Service

Title 28 C.F.R. §548, Subpart C - Special Food and Meals,
provides that special diets are available to meet the medical
needs of diabetics and others who require low-salt, low-calorie,
or other special diets. Additionally, “common-fare” meals are
offered to inmates whose religious practices require dietary
restrictions. See 28 C.F.R. §§547.20(b) and 548.20; Program
Statement 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices. The common
fare program is designed to meet the dietary requirements of
different religions.

5. Personal Property

Bureau of Prisons policy on inmate retention of personal property
is found in Program Statement 5580.07, Personal Property, Inmate.
See also 28 C.F.R. Part 553 - Inmate Property. Inmates may
possess only that property which by policy is authorized. See 28
C.F.LR. $553.11. Those rules contribute to the management of
inmate personal property in the institution, and contribute to a
safe environment for staff and inmates by reducing fire hazards,
security risk, and sanitation problems. Personal hygiene items
are issued by the institution for indigent inmates. Inmates may
also purchase personal property items from the institution
commissary.

Inmates going out to court may bring legal material relevant to
their current court proceedings. Inmates are not allowed toa
return from court with additional legal materials. Attorneys

Hi All,

(QeMasked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. |
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-

counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me
they would get back to me. | haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release
the funds?

college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are
not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for
“The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,” which will show the
world your support for women.

Alternatively PRO eave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math

professors. You can give me a similar award. of Oxford, former President of
the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was
nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Polya Prize-winner
which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in
infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject
your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a
lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting
money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be
open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you’d
have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publically defending you. I
could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

Hi All,

[Rasked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. |
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-
file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein’s will in the media, | told defense
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me
they would get back to me. | haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release
the funds?

Thanks,

el of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but especially African
Americans who may seo their intellectual potential in him. Harcard is prowd to
honor achievements and acknowledge his fine example.”

I can help you.

I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black
college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are
not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for
“The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,” which will show the
world your support for women.

Alternatively POMOC Rave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math
professors. You can give me a similar award BQR@OORIRA of Oxford, former President of
the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was
nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Pélya Prize-winne
which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in
infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject
your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my a/ma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a
lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowshi

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting
money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be
open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you’d
have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publically defending you. I
could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

Good morning Mr. [enenl

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a
meeting last Friday ith and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told
our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when
meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer QB¥Mitold my client and I that he would not be
allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from
Liutenant {Mor Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr.
Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone
calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with
his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to
9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been
eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

world’s niet impressive poung mathematicians,” said Dr. Counter. “He is a meod-
el of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but especially African
Americans who may seo their intellectual potential in him. Harcard is prowd to
honor achievements and acknowledge his fine example.”

I can help you.

I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black
college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are
not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for
“The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,” which will show the
world your support for women.

Alternatively, PEOme | gave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math
professors. You can give me a similar award PGW ORE of Oxford, former President of
the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was
nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Polya Prize-winnr iii
which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in
infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject
your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my a/ma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a
lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowshi

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting
money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be
open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you’d
have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publically defending you. I
could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

The Court will conduct a brief hearing on Tuesday, August 27, 2019 at 10:30 a.m. in
connection with the nolle prosequi order proposed to the Court on August 19, 2019 by the United
States Attorney.

The Court believes that where, as here, a defendant has died before any judgment has
been entered against him, the public may still have an informational interest in the process by
which the prosecutor seeks dismissal of an indictment.

At the hearing, Counsel for the Government and for the deceased Defendant, Jeffrey
Epstein, will be heard. Counsel for the victims and the victims will also be heard, if they wish to
be.

The hearing will be held in Courtroom 17B.

file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein’s will in the media, | told defense
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me
they would get back to me. | haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release
the funds?

are requesting:

Good morning Mr. Pe |

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a
meeting last Friday with and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told
our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when
meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (QQ told my client and I that he would not be
allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from
Liutenant (Q@@jor Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr.
Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone
calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with
his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to
9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been
eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

The letter looks like it was addressed tp OME] He's the former doctor for the U.S. Female Gymnastics

tried calling you earner. My Cent, Jetirey Epstein ( /03 18-UD4) intormed me that
he had a meeting last Friday with SOOO RG and Mr. Pluorde,
where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom
once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer
(QORtold my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless
a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [Qj or Mr.
Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde
or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to
have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day
meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would
have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for
the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper
meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Good afternoon Mr.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap
machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls.
Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Hello,

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in
responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream
media.

We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the
information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you
have any statement on the situation?

Thank you,

Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone
calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with
his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to
9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been
eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Wow, right as | finished my last email, my boss just gave me the final response that I'll now send to all the
reporters who reached out to our public affairs office in Central Office (you can send this to media who

contacted you too

Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been
reported. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an
inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.

Obviously numerous Epstein articles. This is a sampling.

Star Tribune: "Epstein's guards worked extreme OT shifts morning of death" Guards on
Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working extreme overtime shifts to make up for staffing shortages the
morning of his apparent suicide, a person familiar with the jail's operations told The Associated
Press. http://www.startribune.com/epstein-dies-in-the-dark-but-abuse-investigation-carries-

on/533900392/

WaPo: "Corrections officers did not check on Epstein for ‘several hours’ before his death,
violating protocol, person familiar with case says," Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett,
August 11, 2019, 11:13 PM Corrections officers had not checked in on financier and registered
sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for “several” hours before he was found hanging in his cell Saturday, a
person familiar with the matter said, just one in a series of missteps in the hours leading up to his
death. [Continue Reading]

AP: "Debbie Wasserman Schultz demands Epstein investigation," Jerry Dunleavy, August
11, 2019, 7:44 PM Democratic Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz described as "obscenely
inadequate" the Saturday announcement from Attorney General William Barr that Inspector General
Michael Horowitz would be investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of pedophile

Jeffrey Epstein. [Continue Reading]

NYT: “Before Jail Suicide, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left Alone and Not Closely Monitored,” Katie
Benner, August 11, 2019, 11:00 AM

Jeffrey Epstein, the financier wno hanged himself in a federal jail in Manhattan, was supposed to
have been checked by guards every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not being followed the
night before he was found, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said. In
addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell
just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail’s
normal procedure, two officials said. [Continue Reading]

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
MEMORANDUM

Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York

DATE:
TO:

FROM:

THRU:

SUBJECT: RESUBMITTAL OF PROCEDURAL MEMORANDUM FOR
PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION

The original Procedural memorandum for Psychological Observation was initially submitted on July 20,
2005 to the Warden and through the Associate Warden of Programs. The procedures outlined below
have been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmitted as revisions
have been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.

1. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),
New York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.

a) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a
mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental
status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate
is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general
population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological
observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal
(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to
his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,
disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.
Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until
such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in
general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an
inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

3, PROCEDURES: The following are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:

A. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an
inmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an
inmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological
Observation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff
(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food
Service Administrator, and Duty Officer.

B. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not

feasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The
inmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a

----------------------------------------
staff member.

C. An inmate on Psychological Observation status is allowed only items indicated by a
Psychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate’s psychological observation log
book. The suicide watch mattress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on
psychological observation.

D. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every 15
minutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but observation of
the inmate is continuous.

E. When the observation is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will
make hourly rounds and sign the log book.

F. A Lieutenant and Physician Assistant will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log

G. Ona daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological Observation and
sign the log book.

H. If there is a staff watch being conducted on 9S, the staff member cannot watch more than
two inmates on psychological observation at a time. If the Staff member is watching two
inmates on psychological observation, they must be directly next to one another so that the
officer can directly observe both of them on a continuous basis.

records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's
subpoena Is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death

tomorrow. His attorney, bas represented him in the past, and represents him in
connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC
today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in
because he is from out-of-state.

We’re concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment
(as we would be for any defendant) and so | wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address
this issue sop POOR can meet with his client this evening? I’m available anytime at

(GM discuss, if that’s helpful, or [PCO Jcan also be reached directly at if that’s
easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I’d be
grateful).

thanks very much,

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested
last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an
indictment tomorrow. His attorney, PEXQOORP Bas represented him in the past, and
represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the
weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but
was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.

We’re concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the
presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all

possible to address this issue s can meet with his client this evening? I’m
available anytime at to discuss, if that’s helpful, or PQ@VOMB an also be
reached directly at f that’s easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you

could please just let me know afterward I’d be grateful).

thanks very much,

Do you mind calling attorney conference in the morning and reminding them to hold room 3 open for 10:00
AM? POP MARME POO PIG and Epstein will likely have an attorney visit, but we need room 3
open for this hearing. If they have to keep Room 3 closed from 8:00 to 10:00 to ensure it is available, then

that's what we have to do. DOSS SSS his is

It is easier for us to initiate the call here at MCC. will be on a phone that does not allow incoming
calls, so we prefer to call the court (or you) at the designated time and transfer the call down to him. Please
let us know if that is an issue. Assuming there's no problem with that, please let us know the appropriate

Also, so you're aware, we make every effort to facilitate telephonic court appearances, but there may be
emergency circumstances that interfere. If we learn that we will not be able to facilitate the call for some

Good morning Mr EO

With apologies for the delay, medical staff can accept his CPAP machine. Would you or one of your

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday,
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, the Attorney General has
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter
as well.

Hi Darri eave

At Judge Berman's invitation, | went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the
government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

(b)(5)

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a
particular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel

obviously didn't know that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go
to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

METADATA_SOURCE: .
METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00024185.jpg
----------------------------------------
The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement.
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC
with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. | won't rehash the
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and
ended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; | verbally updated him, but he may need to
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Thanks,

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday,
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, the Attorney General has
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter
as well.

Good morning Christine,

| apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've

morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge
Berman another time. Perhaps the Warden and | could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a
time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.

Thank you for your help, and | look forward to seeing you on Monday (re and Tuesday.

Dear Warden N’Diaye,

Thank you for your letter of August 10, 2019 regarding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr.

Epstein’s death is a tragedy to everyone involved in his case.

One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your
will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019. To my

letter

knowledge, it has never been definitively explained whet the BOP concluded about that incident.

| hope this finds you well. My name is CS a I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm
sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to

Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (| hear there
have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and | was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat
on background (meaning that | will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you).

I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know,
and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please
let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556 {9/0}

Was he on some type of suicide watch, given the incident last month, and what did that entail?

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested
last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an
indictment tomorrow. His attorney, PEX@MOR Bas represented him in the past, and
represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the
weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but
was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.

We’re concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the
presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all

possible to address this issue s can meet with his client this evening? I’m
available anytime at to discuss, if that’s helpful, or PQ@QVOM an also be
reached directly at f that’s easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you

could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).

thanks very much,

Gentlemen. Do you have time for a quick update call before I leave for my trip with

Does 12 noon work? If there is something new and pressing, we can do a call

Couldn't see the entire article on my phone, but I wouldn't be surprised there are staff that are
paid contacts for local media outlets. This has also been discussed at the Department level all the

Gentlemen. Do you have time for a quick update call before I leave for my trip with
the AG?

Does 12 noon work? If there is something new and pressing, we can do a call
earlier.

Here is the approved response:

For privacy and safety and security reasons, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) does not release information on an individual inmate's
conditions of confinement. However, we can share that Jeffrey Edward Epstein is currently located at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday,
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, the Attorney General has
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter
as well.

Hello,

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in
responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream
media.

We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the
information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you
have any statement on the situation?

Thank you,

reporters who reached out to our public affairs office in Central Office (you can send this to media who
contacted you too PPO: CXC) |

Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been
reported. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an
inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.

they are getting media inquiries and called me. And DOJ's Legislative Affairs team as well as BOP's legislative

The final response to media that will be approved by DOJ should be given to me within the hour and | will

The CNN article is quite critical and says DOJ officials are expressing frustration that the info BOP provided is
turning up wrong. The only example they give is that officials believed over weekend he as released on bail,
but it turns out that he was just moved to another facility. That is NOT TRUE. He was released and is not in

The CNN article is quite critical and says DOJ officials are expressing frustration that the info BOP provided is
turning up wrong. The only example they give is that officials believed over weekend he as released on bail,
but it turns out that he was just moved to another facility. That is NOT TRUE. He was released and is not in
BOP custody. Can you call OPA and ensure they know the truth as they are the DOJ officials that CNN is
referring to. We never said he was released on bail...we only said he was released and that remains accurate.
Thanks.

Hello, I’m working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against, _|

Pemme ve spoken to an AFGE union official on EE cfnse attorney. The
story will run over the weekend so I’d appreciate a response by COB today.

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of
documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the
facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people | spoke to, there has not been a hiring
surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.

Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein’s death?

Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?

Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein’s suicide?

Is it correct that Noel and Thomas were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the
suicide?

What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays
in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it’s available.)

Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges?
What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?

Thank you,

Manhattan Federal Court reporter

| hope this finds you well. My name is nd I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm
sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to
Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (| hear there
have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and | was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat
on background (meaning that | will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you).

I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know,
and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please
let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-5569

Good morning Sey

| spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's
subpoena Is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death
in this context. Once | receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, | will have the USAO's Civil Division
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Hugh,

1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide
Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA.

2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding
more information.

(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOP’s
response to the union’s contention is staffing shortages Is at the root of the problem?

Hi there,

I'm writing a piece for the site Gothamist about conditions at MCC. See allegations below, compiled from
defense attorneys , current prisoners and their loved ones. Please send comment ASAP if you would like to
respond.

Regards

—that some cells in the facility are covered in mold

— that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for
prisoners to take showers at a reasonable temperature

— that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They “be lucky if they were treated like dirt under
somebody else's shoe, but they're not even treated that well,” said one lawyer

— that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility (“whether its
people who are suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need
spiritual guidance or religious accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get
warehoused there - all of that is lacking.”)

— that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women’s floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to
clean up the feces themselves

Hi there,

I'm writing a piece for the site Gothamist about conditions at MCC. See allegations below, compiled from
defense attorneys , current prisoners and their loved ones. Please send comment ASAP if you would like to
respond.

Regards

—that some cells in the facility are covered in mold

— that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for
prisoners to take showers at a reasonable temperature

— that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They “be lucky if they were treated like dirt under
somebody else's shoe, but they're not even treated that well,” said one lawyer

— that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility (“whether its
people who are suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need
spiritual guidance or religious accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get
warehoused there - all of that is lacking.”)

— that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women’s floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to
clean up the feces themselves

Good afternoon! We understand two employees of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan
are about to be charged re: lapses the night of Jeffrey Epstein’s death.

Are you representing either of them in the criminal matter? If not, who is? We’d like to reach out of
fairness and to ensure we are separating fact from rumors.

Any guidance/point in the right direction would be most appreciated.

Inmate Death at the MCC New York

New York, NY: On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:30 a.m., inmate Jeffrey
Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent
suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Life-saving
measures were initiated immediately by responding staff. Staff requested emergency medical
services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local
hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital
staff. The FBI is investigating the incident.

Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under
pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.

MCC New York is an Administrative security facility that currently houses 763 male offenders
in New York, New York.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by} ‘| Chief Psychologist. He
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

Hi, | know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details | see out there:

was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two

weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail’s normal procedure, two officials said.

Senior Editor, writer
The Daily Beast

1. When was Epstein taken off suicide watch?

2. How long was he on suicide watch?

3. What unit in the jail was he housed?

4. Was he by himself?

5. What’s protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period?

6. Is there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of restricted duty while
there is an ongoing investigation?

7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show?

8. What did he use to hang himself?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided b

Chief Psychologist. He

will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a

serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

and will be celled with inmate?"

Epstein Update
TEXT.htm

Good morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his
neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is
aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in
his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate

| told him he

can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned
to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to

Chief Psychologist

Federal Bureau of Prisons

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another

cell.

Thanks,

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another
cell.

Thanks,

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by|*"'""""’_ | Chief Psychologist. He
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the

placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a

serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to

intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
and will be celled with inmate)’ °""”’

PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were
not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations
by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special
Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since
the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the
beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely
limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish
converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,
information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support
actionable findings and recommendations is limited.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Mr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August 10, 2019, while housed
at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills,

former Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a
b}(6); (br MC}

psychological reconstruction._ The team consisted o National Suicide Prevention
Coordinator, Central Office;|°°° °°" Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator,
‘ica Mental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and
Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This
reconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement

5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.

(b (6) (bXT HC)

Social History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of
the reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.
The following was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in 1953
and grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,
Brooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein
graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969, at the age of 16. He attended Cooper Union and
New York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,
a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from September 1974 until he was

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a
number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at

Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a
financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Nicest also being identified ape

mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million
dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his
considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence
and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In

June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count
Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for
Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration
and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the
National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month
incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he
followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (a), (b) (2), 2
on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females
over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited
minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated
with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor
females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not
guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman
on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others
and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s
proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held
on remand.

Institutional History: On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in

New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this
arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that
evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22
hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit
(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness
of his notoriety among the inmate population.

With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report
while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident
report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether

Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s
prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate
Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION
BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with
hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis

unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,

omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the
prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.
However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”
thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications
prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine
which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP
machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

In regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no known available records. Any
records that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were
not available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System
records in BEMR (PDS-BEMR)] Forensic Psychologist at

MCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2019. During this screening,
Mr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No
symptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level 1 and
was not diagnosed with a mental illness.

Following a consultation wi National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on

July 8, 2019° ee hief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein
should be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary
consideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and
media attention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.
Mr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal

thoughts at that time, but due to the potential for other risk factors listed above, the on-call
psychologist placed Mr. Epstein on Psychological Observation in one of the suicide watch cells
until he could be assessed in person by a BOP psychologist. Psychological Observation is a
form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates
who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive
housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their
transition and safety after an acute suicidal oot Re July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a
formal, in-person suicide risk assessment wit She determined that, while suicide
watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation
status out of an abundance of caution. He was removed from Psychological Observation on
July 10, 2019.

Mr. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes.
Thereafter, he remained in the suicide watch cell and was placed on Psychological Observation,
where he remained housed until July 30, 2019, according to PDS-BEMR records. A discrepancy
exists regarding when he was removed from Psychological Observation. His cell assignment,
per SENTRY, indicates he was transferred back to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on

July 29, 2019, whereas PDS-BEMR indicates he was removed from Psychological Observation
on July 30, 2019, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

assessment. She determined suicide watch was not searcented at that time.

Mr. Epstein remained classified as a Mental Health Care Level 1 throughout his time at

MCC New York. During his contacts with psychologists, Mr. Epstein routinely denied current
mental health symptoms to include suicidal ideation, and he did not exhibit symptoms of a
serious mental illness. However, there was evidence Mr. Epstein was experiencing challenges

adjusting to his environment and changes in his lifestyle. He reported frequent complaints of
difficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided
to him on July 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At
times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or ona general population housing unit.

On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he des ribed himself as a coward and as
someone who does not like pain. On July 28,2019, he told) =‘ the toilet in his cell would
not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his
hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was
unable to sleep that night.

ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual
offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged
sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019,
Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

After 31 hours and 5 minutes on Suicide Watch, he was then
placed on Psychological Observation. On July 30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from

¥ (br IC)

Psychological Observation. sent an e-mail reporting Mr. Epstein had been removed
from Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate, This
e-mail was sent to 71 MCC New York staff and, as of August 13, 2019, only 27 staff members
had opened the message.

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the
public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book
order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for
Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their
Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The
documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who
alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was
Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.
According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days
although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist
and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and
the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A
social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein,
knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with
him.

Following his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein was moved into
his SHU cell. He was single-celled at that time because his cellmate (Efrain Reyes #85993-054)

(DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the
EW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer Specialist’ “’°"”"” SHU

DESCRIPTION OF SCENE

A detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered

Mr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report
of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in
the SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called

for medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff
stated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED
reportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to
Health Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at
6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:10 a.m. Mr. Epstein was
pronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing
video footage.

CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when
reviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,
were likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in
individuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of
sexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to
utilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative
affect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the
loss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the
loss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide
among individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,
and lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.

Mr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He
had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he
accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many
associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared

In the weeks
before his death, he made statements that he was “a coward” and was having difficulty adapting
to his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to
tolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were
unsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some
of his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status
in both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in
prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.

5. Telephone Calls: In a PDS-BEMR note written by’ jon July 16, 2019, she was
informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for
Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence
that they took place on a monitored telephone.

According to a memorandum from Unit Manage}
Mr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a
telephone call to his family" °"~’ who was the Institutional Duty Officer that
week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in
the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call.
Since Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to
use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that
reportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told!“ _{he was calling his

mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.

6. Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until
July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an
attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was
without “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by
P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on
July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for
9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on
July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated.
During these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not
maintained as required by MCC New York’s Procedural Memorandum for Psychological
Observation.

7. Follow-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While

okay, and he reportedly said he was. Howeve oted in her e-mail she was
not convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So
just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from
Psychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutena
the e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by

9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant
disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt
to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist
should have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The
BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.
Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider
the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”
Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to
move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate
are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security
concerns are highli Services staff,”|>

susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience
stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,
movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through
the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he
departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in
SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)
provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The
notice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The
USMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy.
On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m./?° 0" ene jan e-mail reporting she had
just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information
about this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services
about a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been followed as outlined
in P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when a staff member becomes
aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff
member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,

There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he
returned from court until he was seen by" |for a suicide risk assessment on
August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According toa SENTRY quarters

Mr. Epstein’s SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, ae him, at the time of his death. However.

assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU
locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region.
The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate".

cell 220L (SENTRY never shows a in ces cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The
suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit
code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified
by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed
Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books
indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while
there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to
HO1-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general
population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch
cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required
by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death.
Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby
areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not
secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the
reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a
suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law
enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime
scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence
and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent
investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic
concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the
Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one
in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff
were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the
reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,
entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and
out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently
labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been
torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an
adequate system of control and monitoring.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday,
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, the Attorney General has
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter
as well.

I’ll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, | just received a phone call from
defense counsel that a person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named
phonetic) who claimed to be an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that
Mr. Epstein’s body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and that the individual could make
arrangements for retrieval of the bodyJ?\°..__ left his phone number as 646-83?" 1"

Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is
understandably concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get
hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through phone calls and emails. And we would again
respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to go to
representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with
confidence that it is true and accurate.

(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein’s body, his defense
counsel is extremely concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any
other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has
also been informed—but that’s only if this is not a hoax, obviously.)

Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps
to retrieve the body.

This is the response [am sending the RD. Are you ok with this?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by|""'"""”' | Chief Psychologist. He
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
and will be celled with inmate|”’

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because

he requested Protective Custody.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the

placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm

functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,
no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines

and no proper meal.

| visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so |
had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom | saw him
interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention.
He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at
the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in
the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had
planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

The Honorable Ron DeSantis
State of Florida

400 S. Monroe St.
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

Dear Governor DeSantis,

“For 48 years, I've dedicated my life to enforcing and upholding the law; as a patrol officer, detective,
chief of police and, since 2004, as the Sheriff of Palm Beach County.

My job now, as it has always been, is to not only maintain public safety but also the public's trust.

Given the recent questions that have been raised around the Jeffrey Epstein case, | am formally
requesting that FDLE assume the existing criminal investigation and | pledge the cooperation and
participation of my agency. | believe the public interest would be best served by an FDLE-led
investigation examining every aspect of the Epstein case, from court sentencing to incarceration. My
agency will continue with the on-going internal affairs investigation.

As you know, Governor, I’m proud of this Department, and the men and women who devote their lives
every day to protecting others. Be rest assured as with any issue or concern that has crossed my desk
over the past 15 years will strive for the truth, wherever that leads, to ensure justice is served and the
public trust in our lay/enforcement agency is maintained.”

Sincerely,

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were
not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations
by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special
Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since
the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the
beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely
limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish
converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,
information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support
actionable findings and recommendations is limited.

Name: Jeffrey Epstein

Register Number: 76318-054

Date of Death: 08-10-2019

Prepared by: ational Suicide Prevention Coordinator,

Psychology Services Branch, Central Office

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Mr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August 10, 2019, while housed
at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills,
former Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a

(b}(6); (oF WC)

Central Office; Mental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and
orrectional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This

reconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement
5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.

Social History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of
the reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.
The following was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in 1953
and grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,
Brooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein
graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969, at the age of 16. He attended Cooper Union and
New York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,
a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from September 1974 until he was

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a
number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at

Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a
financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

Mr. Epstein had two significant periods of See the HS Gs these was his position as a
consultant wit

mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million
dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his
considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence
and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In

June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count
Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for
Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration
and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the
National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month
incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he
followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (a), (b) (2), 2
on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females
over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited
minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated
with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor
females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not
guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman
on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others
and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s
proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held
on remand.

Institutional History: On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in

New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this
arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that
evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22
hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit
(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness
of his notoriety among the inmate population.

With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report
while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident
report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether

Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s
prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate
Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION
BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with
hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis

unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,

omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the
prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.
However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”
thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications
prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine
which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP
machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

In regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no known available records. Any
records that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were
not available for review as of the sate of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System
wii Forensic Psychologist at
MCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2019. During this screening,
Mr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No
symptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level 1 and
was not diagnosed with a mental illness.

Following a consultation with|""’""””’ _|National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on

July §, 2019 Foe hief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein
should be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary
consideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and
media attention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.
Mr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal

thoughts at that time, but due to the potential for other risk factors listed above, the on-call
psychologist placed Mr. Epstein on Psychological Observation in one of the suicide watch cells
until he could be assessed in person by a BOP psychologist. Psychological Observation is a
form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates
who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive
housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their
transition and safety after an acute suicidal crisis. On July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a
formal, in-person suicide risk assessment with|"”” She determined that, while suicide
watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation
status out of an abundance of caution. He was removed from Psychological Observation on
July 10, 2019.

Mr. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes.
Thereafter, he remained in the suicide watch cell and was placed on Psychological Observation,
where he remained housed until July 30, 2019, according to PDS-BEMR records. A discrepancy
exists regarding when he was removed from Psychological Observation. His cell assignment,
per SENTRY, indicates he was transferred back to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on

July 29, 2019, whereas PDS-BEMR indicates he was removed from Psychological Observation
on July 30, 2019, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

Mr. Epstein attended a court hearing on July 31, 2019, and, upon his return, the United States
Marshals Service (USMS) provided paperwork to Receiving and Discharge (R&D) staff that
noted “suicidal tendencies.”|"""'"' _|was notified on August 1, 2019, about this paperwork.
She consulted with?’ and then met with Mr. Epstein to conduct a suicide risk
assessment. She determined suicide watch was not warranted at that time.

Mr. Epstein remained classified as a Mental Health Care Level 1 throughout his time at

MCC New York. During his contacts with psychologists, Mr. Epstein routinely denied current
mental health symptoms to include suicidal ideation, and he did not exhibit symptoms of a
serious mental illness. However, there was evidence Mr. Epstein was experiencing challenges

adjusting to his environment and changes in his lifestyle. He reported frequent complaints of
difficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided
to him on July 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At
times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit.
On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described himself as a coward and as
someone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2019, he told’’”’”””’ __the toilet in his cell would
not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his
hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was
unable to sleep that night.

ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual
offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged
sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019,
Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

After 31 hours and 5 minutes on Suicide Watch, he was then

from Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate, This
e-mail was sent to 71 MCC New York staff and, as of August 13, 2019, only 27 staff members
had opened the message.

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the
public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book
order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for
Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their
Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The
documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who
alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was
Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.
According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days
although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist
and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and
the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A
social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein,
knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with
him.

Following his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein was moved into
his SHU cell. He was single-celled at that time because his cellmate (Efrain Reyes #85993-054)

staff were informed at approximately 1:50 p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmat would likely not

DESCRIPTION OF SCENE

A detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered

Mr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report
of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in
the SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called
for medical assistance, activated the |" , and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff
stated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED
reportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to
Health Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at
6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:10 a.m. Mr. Epstein was
pronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing
video footage.

CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when
reviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,
were likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in
individuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of
sexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to
utilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative
affect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the
loss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the
loss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide
among individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,
and lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.

Mr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He
had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he
accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many
associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared

profile individuals. |?”

before his death, he made statements that he was “a coward” and was having difficulty adapting
to his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to
tolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were
unsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some
of his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status
in both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in
prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.

The following recommendations concern institution operations:

Manual.

5. Telephone Calls: Ina PDS-BEMR note written by/?'""° _|on July 16, 2019, she was
informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for
Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence
that they took place on a monitored telephone.

who was the Institutional Duty Officer that
week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in
the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call.
Since Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to
use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that
ere he was calling his
mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.

6. Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until
July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an
attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was
without “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by
P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on
July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for
9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on
July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated.

Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by"
9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant
disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt
to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist
should have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The
BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.
Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider
the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”
Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to
move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate
are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and

[DID
concerns are hig Services staff.”

Both of these groups of inmates are
susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience
stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,
movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through
the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he
departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in
SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)
provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The
notice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The
USMS requested R&D staff ae oe eve and they then departed with the signed copy.

aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff
member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According toa SENTRY quarters

roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to
Mr. Epstein’s SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However,

his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate

until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters histsey

assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU
locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region.
The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate[®® .,

212U (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate Epstein in
cell 220L (SENTRY never shows Bune. in Soe cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-

identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell
Z06-220U from August 5, 2019 to August 9, 2019.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The
suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit
code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified
by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed
Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books
indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while
there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to
HO1-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general
population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch
cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing
Format, only shows three cells.

12.

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required
by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death.
Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby
areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not
secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the
reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a
suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law
enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime
scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence
and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent
investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic
concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the
Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one
in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff
were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the
reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,
entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and
out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently
labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been
torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an
adequate system of control and monitoring.

. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution

revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and
incomplete.

. Post Orders & SHU Training: SHU Post Orders Sign-In Sheets were reviewed for the 34

Quarter, spanning June 9, 2019, to September 7, 2019. Office

this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or
when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell
them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

Thank you,

FINDINGS
This assessment and the resulting recommendations are based on the following sources of information:
Clinical Interview, Medical Record, Psychology Data System, Sentry

Reason for Referral

R & D staff reported to this writer this morning at about 8:30 AM on 8/01/19 that yesterday when Mr. Epstein was
brought back from court the US Marshals asked him to sign a form that noted Mr. Epstein has "suicidal tendencies." Mr.
Epstein was seen for a Suicide Risk Assessment at about 1:00 PM on 8/01/19 in Attorney Conference.

This note is being entered at about 4:20 PM on 8/01/19.

Mental Health History
According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by” |. "Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental
health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present
with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time."

Self-Harm History
According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by/®': "> | "Inmate Epstein denied any past or present

Current Problem

R & D staff reported to this writer this morning at about 8:30 AM on 8/01/19 that yesterday when Mr. Epstein was
brought back from court the US Marshals asked him to sign a form that noted Mr. Epstein has "suicidal tendencies."
This is likely due to the incident on 7/23/19, but as a precaution another Suicide Risk Assessment was conducted.

Mr. Epstein seemed surprised that there was a form noting suicidal tendencies. He denied stating he was suicidal.

Focus of Session

Inmate Epstein was seen by this writer this morning while on psychological observation in the hospital area of the
prison.
iv jective Presentation

Inmate Epstein was in good spirits today and engaged in reciprocal conversation with this writer this morning. He
smiled and remarked, "welcome back" when this writer arrived. [2

When this writer attempted to get a more detailed account from him, indicating that it would be rare to have
such impairments in memory as he does not suffer from an acute cognitive disorder, he smiled and said he understood
my position.

Inmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it "a
punishment cell." He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong. Inmate Epstein
stated he feels it is dangerous in the SHU, he cannot sleep well up there due to noise from the other inmates, it smells,
and it is difficult for him to work on his legal case up there. He stated he has not received the phone calls he was
promised nor has he been able to receive recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the
attorney conference room and it is likely that he has missed the times when staff members have attempted to give him
phone calls and recreation. Inmate Epstein also reported complaints about the attorney conference room, stating they
do not take him to the bathroom frequently enough.

Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating "| am too vested in my case to fight it, | have a life
and | want to go back to living my life." He denied any acute symptoms at this time.

According to his log book, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has
also been attending his daily legal visits.

Intervention(s)
Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping
strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was mostly receptive to these interventions. He requested to be housed in general
population rather than the SHU and stated he wanted to remain on psychological observation due to his concerns with
being in the SHU.

Progress/Plan

In an abundance of caution, inmate Epstein will remain on psychological observation.

Inmate Epstein will be seen daily by psychology while on

and the high profile nature of his alleged offense, Mr. EPSTEIN will be stepped down from
Suicide Watch to Psychological Observation.

Changes in Risk Factors Assessed

having previously taught mathematics and physics. He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating,
and drinking within normal limits.

Upon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shower. His requests were
made known to the lieutenants and he was provided a shower prior to attending his legal visit. This writer also provided
him a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products.

Reason for Removal from Watch

Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "| have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his
being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include
interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not
do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than
in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be
re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU
and asked if there were a "safer" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr.
EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on
Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for
one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this
information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.

Focus of Session

Inmate Epstein was seen today for a psychological observation contact in the hospital area by this writer.
iv jective Presentation

Inmate Epstein appeared well and it was noted in his log book and eating/sleeping chart that he has been eating his
meals, sleeping, interacting with the inmate companions, and pacing in his cell. Today, he presented this writer with
numerous concerns and requests. He stated he does not want to be housed in the SHU because he is not comfortable
there; he wants to be single-celled if he goes to the SHU; he wants Colace, not the Ducolex he received from medical
yesterday; he wants to be able to walk around and go to recreation; he does not want to wear an orange uniform to his
legal visits because he is treated “like a punished inmate;" he wants a phone call before he leaves the psychological
observation area; he wants a shower and towel; he would like to be housed in the cadre (5S) unit; and would like his
property, paper, and a pen.

Inmate Epstein's concerns were addressed by this writer and it was explained to him he will not be single-celled or
placed in a housing unit for safety and security concerns. His medical concerns (constipation) were discussed with
health services as well as his desire to be placed on Colace. Inmate Epstein was provided a shower this morning.

Intervention(s)

Inmate Epstein was provided with supportive intervention and coping skills strategies today. He was receptive to
interventions and was able to elucidate his various needs. He did not present with any acute psychopathology and
continues to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He is looking forward to his bail hearing on Monday but
stated he is aware that even if he gets bail, it will take at least two weeks to sort things out so he can leave the jail.

Progr Plan
Inmate Epstein is not in any psychological distress, does not present with any mental health symptoms or complaints,
and is denying any suicidality. He appears psychologically stable at this time and can be released from the
psychological observation area. Inmate Epstein will be housed in the 9S area with a cellmate. He will be seen again
tomorrow by psychology to evaluate his mental status and psychological stability.

Questionnaire (PSIQ) when he entered the institution. Nonetheless, Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for
suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had
a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein

suicide.

The following STATIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate’s risk for engaging in suicide related
behaviors: Sex offender status, Lack of family connections, High Profile Crime

Of the DYNAMIC risk factors assessed, none were found to be present.

The following PROTECTIVE factors were assessed to be present and may decrease the inmate's risk of suicide:Willingness to
engage in treatment, View of death as negative, Future orientation, Denial of suicidal ideation/intention/plans, Adequate problem
solving skills, Able to identify reasons to live

As noted above, Inmate Epstein is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time
including a high profile case with extensive media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court
proceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this

Despite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly
denied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his
attorney, to take a shower, and to brush his teeth. He was eating his cereal when this writer arrived and said "| have my paper

health histories. Inmate Epstein stated he is a mathematician and took post graduate classes in this area of study. Inmate
Epstein stated he has a support system in the community, including friends and other associates. Finally, inmate Epstein
demonstrated a good sense of humor and did not appear dysphoric, agitated or anxious. No acute psychopathology was noted.

Overall, inmate Epstein has numerous protective factors at this time that outweigh his risk factors for suicidality. He has a
positive outlook regarding his legal case, demonstrates no psychiatric symptoms, has no psychiatric or suicide history, and

Inmate Epstein is currently on psychological observation pending suitable housing placement. In light of his current sex offense
charges and extensive media coverage on the television, he will need to be confined in a suitable housing unit. Inmate Epstein
will be seen daily while on psychological observation and will be seen for a psychological observation follow-up session once he
is released from observation. Inmate Epstein denied the need for psychological intervention, self-help materials, or follow-up.
He has been classified as a CC1-MH inmate at this time. CARE1-MH is indicative of an inmate who shows no significant level
of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and demonstrates no need for regular mental health intervention.

factors for suicidality including a high profile case — media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court
proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate
Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology
department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist
and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment.

( ) High Risk of Abusiveness. It is recommended this inmate be housed in the Special Housing Unit in accordance with

Correctional Services
Inmate Accountability: SHU

*" A whiteboard has been installed in the Special Housing Unit
identifying the cell assignment of each inmate and
pertinent information of each inmate which aids in
accountability. This assists in correcting cell assignment
discrepancies and aid in identifying programing needs (3
man hold, razor restriction, etc.).

=" TDY Staff have been assisting Correctional Services with
vacant positions; Correctional Officers, Lieutenant’s and
Deputy Captain.

=" Addition to the Captains 2 hour SHU video review, IDO’s are
reviewing 6 hours of SHU video encompassing all three shift
weekly.

" IDO’s are conduction Bed book counts on weekends during the

10:00 am count.

" Single cell report emailed to the Warden each shift and
receives approval memorandum for each.

" Morning Watch Lieutenant supervises one count in SHU and is
documented in the LT’s Log.

Psychology

=" Running Hospital Rosters Every Morning to see if inmates on
SW are in the proper cells according to their Sentry
assignments. Inconsistencies are reported the Associate
Warden of Programs. Further, C&A is contacted to make
appropriate corrections on the roster.

"=" Court rosters are reviewed every day to see if any Psy
Alerts are going out to court so that we can check in with
them upon their return.

=" PSY ALERT inmate assignments are considered for inmates
with ongoing risk factors associated with suicidality
(e.g., sex offender status, high profile) even regardless
of whether they exhibit substantial acute mental health
symptoms.

" The Chief Psychologist has written a new procedural
Memorandum for Psy Alert inmates which is undergoing review
in Central Office.

*" Psychology has been routing Hot List via e-mail to
Lieutenant's and Executive Staff each time new inmates are
added to the hot list.

*" Psychology has been providing feedback at Executive Staff
Meetings regarding inmates at-risk for suicidality and

discussing cellmate placement (both GP and SHU) for inmates
with significant mental health issues and suicide risk
factors.

= When inmates are added and released from Suicide Watch, an
email and a phone call is made to Warden and the Operations
Lieutenant notifying them of the addition or termination of
the watch as well as their need for cellmates. This
recommendation is also placed in the Post Suicide Watch
Report in PDS and the psychologist indicates exactly who
they contacted about the inmate's need for a cellmate in
the recommendation section of the report.

=" Suicide Watch Books are reviewed daily by a psychologist
and audited to see if the Unit Officer and Lieutenant make
appropriate rounds and signed the log books each shift (MW,
DW, and EW). Inconsistencies are sent to the Captain and
Associate Warden of Programs.

Correctional Systems

=" Since September 9, 2019, inmates have been tracked when
released from court by utilizing the PP63 Sentry function
as opposed to tracking by out count. There has been no
issues to date utilizing this procedure.

*" All releases are being reviewed by a higher authority other
than the CSO/SCSS. Typically reviewed by the Case
Management Coordinator.

Correctional Programs

Inmate Accountability:

" New bed books have been provided to each unit. A daily
schedule of bed book counts has been established to ensure
appropriate accountability of all inmates. Bed book counts
are notated in the Daily Lieutenant Logs for Executive
Staff review. Additionally, an Executive Staff member is
present each evening to monitor this process and identify
discrepancies. All discrepancies are typically corrected
immediately.

MCC NEW YORK UPDATES

Current Assessment:

Some of the issues identified are due to seriously reduced
staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and
oversight. Since January 1, 2019, MCC New York has hired 18
staff and lost 33 staff to retirement, and transfers within the
BOP and other agencies.

To date approximately approximately 148 staff from multiple
regions assisted NYM which we are very grateful for their
assistance. All subject matter TDY staff are required to
provide a report to the Warden prior to their departure. This
report is similar to a Program Review report and includes areas
of concern, tasks done well and recommendations. These reports
will be shared with the Associate Wardens and Department Heads
for guidance.

Further, to ensure the training and efforts that will occur is
sustainable, there will need to be continuous oversight by
leadership. Therefore, several positions will need to be added
to the staff compliment, such as an Associate Warden over
Correctional Services, a Deputy Captain, and an Assistant Case
Management Coordinator, Assistant Food Services Administrator,
to name a few.

MEMORANDUM FOR HUGH J. HURWITZ, ASSISISTANT DIRECTOR,
REENTRY SERVICES DIVISION

FROM: ARY.,. Warden, MCC New York

SUBJECT: Institution Response to Psychological Reconstruction
Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (763 18-054)

This is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (763 18-054) dated
December 27, 2019.

2. 30 Minute Rounds

The substance of the two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video review is unclear, Please clarify
the requirement for the Captain and IDO. Additionally, please identify the documentation used to maintain
accountability of the reviews.

Institution Response:

Video review requirements have been instituted by NERO. Specifically of each week, the
institution is notified by NERO of the date, time, and SHU range in which to download video. The video is a
two hour block. The video is to be reviewed by the Captain. During the reviews the Captain is looking for
strict adherence to the requirements that rounds be conducted at least once during every 30-minute period, not to
exceed 40 minutes between rounds and that all scheduled counts are being conducted in the SHU. The Captain
will then submit an assurance memo to the institutional executive staff and Correctional Services Administrator
(CSA) indicating the designated video footage was reviewed, and corrective actions which were taken for an
deficiencies noted. This memorandum will be submitted to the Regional Office by COB a
Institutional Duty Officers (IDOs) are required to review 6 hours of SHU video, The surveiltance
footage is downloaded by the institutional SIA and a compact disk is provided to the [DOs for review. The

IDOs are reviewing the video for accuracy of the 30 minute rounds. All reviews are documented in the weekly
IDO Report.

3. Cellmate Assignments

Documentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the
importance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes
consultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision
making of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members
present when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not
accurately reflect what occurred.

Institution Response:

As was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions
were made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff
meetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or
Acting Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on
housing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate
presents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a
sex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.
Moving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where
housing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with
psychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.
Please see the attached checklist.

4, Documentation Accuracy

Professional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted
in your response. However, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in
documentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.

As noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be written within 24 hours of having

the information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules, [0
BT WAY

bit? HA}

Preconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative
explanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.

Please develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for
writing incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include
an outline of the training and evidence of staff who attended the training.

Institution Response:

Additional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In
addition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when
it is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more
appropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual
Training began the week of January 6, 2020, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2020.

telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However, this does not address the report of two telephone calls being provided.
This response implies that the reporting of two staff members is inaccurate.

The response neglects the documented telephone call to Mr. Epstein's deceased mother.
Institution Response:

On August 29, 2019, Warden J. Petrucci, signed a referral related tof" failure to follow policy in
allowing Epstein to complete an unmonitored phone call. The referral was submitted to the Office of Internal
Affairs on that same date and is pending further action at this time.

7. Follow-Up
Please provide documentation for the follow-up training provided to staff detailing the content of the training
and to whom it was provided.

Institution Response:

As recommended by Central Office, the Chief Psychologist has conducted suicide prevention trainings during
Department Head Meetings, e-mail correspondence, SHU Staff Trainings, and Lieutenant’s Trainings. The
follow-up training sign-in sheets, Department Head Meeting Minutes, and e-mails provided by psychology staff
regarding PSY ALERT Inmates are attached for your review.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy

Periodic and unannounced checks are now conducted in SHU to determine pp30 assignments and actual inmate
placement match. Please provide an operational definition of periodic. Please do the same for routine, as it
relates Executive Staff bed book counts in all units. Where will the periodic and routine reviews be documented
and will they include the identity (e.g., name and title) of staff who complete them?

Institution Response:

An Executive Staff and Duty Officer schedule has been implemented to conduct daily 4 P.M. and 10 A.M.
weekend bed book counts. Any discrepancies noted are documented and sent via email to Unit Mangers and
Captain at the conclusion of each count for corrective action. Please see the attached schedule.

9. Attorney Log Books
Please provide a copy of the log book audit.

Institution Response:

The audit revealed the Random Visitor Log Book did not reflect visitor pat searches after May 19, 2019. In
addition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The Contractor/Volunteer Log
Book was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; however, the time of
departure was not always documented. The Attorney Log was missing inmate register numbers and more often
than not was legible. There was no Visitor Denial Log created. The audit conducted on September 25, 2019, is
attached for your review.

Additional corrective measures will now include the Activities Lieutenant checking all Front Lobby log books.
The Captain will ensure these checks are included in the Lieutenant’s Daily Log for Day Watch and Evening
Watch. In addition, the Activities Lieutenant will address any discrepancies immediately through on the spot
training and/or performance log entries.

13. Sex Offense Risk Factors

Psychologists are subject matter experts in sex offender risk factors and they play a crucial role in sharing this
knowledge through traditional settings such as ICT, AT, and institutional meetings. However, Executive Staff
play a pivotal role in establishing and addressing institutional culture and promoting and participating in
training. A lack of a broad understanding of sex offender specific risk factors requires an intentional training
approach led by Executive Staff. They must be out front talking about inmates with a sex offense, expressing an
understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency condoned expectations for the understanding and
treatment of inmates with a sex offenses, and assisting with institutional trainings. These practices encourage a
broader acceptance by line staff.

Institution Response:

The MCC New York Executive Staff are out front talking about inmates with sex offenses, and expressing an
understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency expectations for the understanding and treatment of
inmates with sex offenses. This is done through departmental meetings, trainings, staff recalls and walking and
talking throughout the institution.

MEMORANDUM FOR HUGH J. HURWITZ, ASSISISTANT DIRECTOR,
REENTRY SERVICES DIVISION

FROM: J. Petrucci, Warden, MCC New York 1

SUBJECT: Institution Response to Psychological Reconstruction
Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (763 18-054)

This is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (763 18-054) dated September 17,
2019.

Institution Response: |. Single Cell Placement:

A system has been put in place to ensure inmates are not single celled. A single cell report is completed during each
shift by the SHU Lieutenant during Day Watch and the Operations Lieutenant during the Morning Watch and
Evening Watch. Notifications are made to the Institution Duty Officer (IDO) and Executive Staff.

Psychology discusses the status of inmates who are at-risk for suicidality. their housing needs, as well as their needs
for cellmates during staff meetings, department head meetings. SHU meetings. morning meetings, and close out
meetings.

When inmates are placed on and off suicide watch. the Warden is notified verbally, regardless of the time of day.
The Warden then determines which suicide watch area a suicidal inmate will be housed and if they will be observed
with an inmate companions or a staff member.

Page 753

Psychology verbally notifies the Operations Lieutenant when inmates are removed from suicide watch and that they
will need to be placed with a cellmate. Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from
suicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population setting. The C&A officer is responsible for
entering the proper assignment.

Once an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and
Lieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.
The e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with. This recommendation for
a cellmate and conversation with the Lieutenant is also documented in the Post Suicide Watch Report and placed in
BEMR/PDS.

Psychology Services has eliminated the use of Psychological Observation to avoid any confusion as to the needs of
inmates on a watch status.

2. Rounds: 30-minute rounds are required by P5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.
Institution Response: 2. Rounds:

SHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within
the policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a
daily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets
will be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds. A staff member must
observe all inmates confined in continuous locked down status, such as administrative detention or disciplinary
segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour, followed by another round in the second 30
minute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be
conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart. All observations must be documented.
Closer observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre
behavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take
more security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate. Two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video
review are being conducted.

3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7,2019/"""

a In an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement

repeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk
factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2019,

Institution Response: 3. Cellmate Assignments:

Inmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department
head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens,
Warden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s
attorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making
recommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.
Psychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares
their knowledge with Executive Staff.

The psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.
Epstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. However, that is not correct. MCC New
York Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,
including but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.

BUT HA}

Prior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology
staff, posers all the inmates in SHU at that time and narrowed the list down to the most appropriate candidates.

ihe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be
housed with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses,
dangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narrowed the
possibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-054, was placed in SHU for claims
he was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Attorney’s
Office. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.

Based on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate
in SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York
Executive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators
who are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.

It is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect

staff member should describe the error in the correct log book, to include indicating when they became aware of the
error. The staff member should then notify the Chief Psychologist.

A review of Special Housing Unit Records (BP-A0292) revealed a number of incomplete entries. This document is
used to monitor provision and receipt of basic services such as recreation, medical rounds, showers, meal
consumption, etc. The Officer in Charge signature is missing on 10 occasions and a medical provider's signature is
missing in seven instances. There are six instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein ate his meal. There are nine
instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein took a shower. There are ten instances in which it is not clear if Mr.
Epstein was offered recreation. P5500.15, Correctional Services Manual requires accurate and complete information
on the BP-A0292.

Observation Procedural Memorandum, dated April 15, 2019. A Correctional Officer is required to complete hourly
rounds and sign the log book.

Institution Response: 4. Documentation Accuracy:

The Reconstruction team indicates it is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective
evitenot and references

(7A)

In reference to typographical errors noted in PDS/BEMR notes, the Chief Psychologist has spoken to all psychology
staff members concerning proof reading all documents entered to reduce typos and to improve information accuracy.
Additionally, there is a second Staff Psychologist in the department which helps reduce the workload on current
psychologists, allowing more time for documentation review.

Regarding the Reconstruction team’s concerns in reference to Mr. Epstein’s expunged incident report, staff shall
continue to follow Program Statement 5270.09, Inmate Discipline Program in writing incident reports as
appropriate. As more complex matters (including attempted suicide) warrant, Special Investigative Services staff
will conduct appropriate investigations and make a determination as to whether an incident report is warranted.
Psychology Services staff will also be consulted where their expertise is required.

The Reconstruction team stated medical staff conducted Mr. Epstein’s Intake Screening late. SENTRY records
reflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area on July 6, 2019, at
approximately 9:24 com" m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician
Assistant (PA}Sio fon the same night and approximately 14 minutes after his arrival in R&D. On J uly 9, 2019, he
was placed on Psychological Observation and at approximately 12:38 p.m., he was escorted from Psychological
Observation to Health Services for a Medical Assessment and a History and Physical, which was performed by PA
' ‘within three (3) days of his arrival. According to Program Statement 6031.04, Patient Care, a provider
must perform a History and Physical within 14 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical
and Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.

Regarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug
Abuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide
watch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log
book written by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as
he had written in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff
log book. However, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone
else observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide
watch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are now being closely
monitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.

Incomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be
placed on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s ona daily
basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every
Sunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwritten
manner.

The Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.

The Psychology Department has eliminated Psychology Observation at MCC-NY. Both Staff and the Lieutenants
received additional training on when they are required to complete rounds and sign Suicide Watch log books. With
regard to suicide watch log books signatures, correctional staff are required to perform routine rounds every hour.
The 2 Sally Officer on Monday- Friday during Day Watch is required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates as
prescribed by the Captain. After-hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,
collecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal | or Internal 2 assisting with duties as
assigned by the Captain. Additionally, Psychology staff check the suicide watch logs daily when they interview the
inmates on suicide watch. If it is noted hourly rounds are not being conducted by the Unit Officer and/or the
Lieutenants are not rounding and signing the books each shift, the Associate Warden over Programs and the Captain
are notified immediately and enforce accountability.

5. Telephone Calls: Ina PDS-BEMR note written by" jon July 16, 2019, she was informed by an unnamed
staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these
calls were placed and no evidence that they took place on a monitored telephone.

According to a memorandum from Unit Manage} yn August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein terminated his
legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a telephone call to his family. Mr. |°°’“"|(who was the
Institutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed

system, = Unit Manager placed the call, me a number that reportedly _ with area code 347. Mr. _—

Institution Response: 5. Telephone calls:

There is no documentation to substantiate that a Lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However,
there is documented evidence that Unit Manageleiric)_|provided a call to Mr. Epstein on July 30, 2019, at 5:15 p.m.,
| eilcladeniaala friend, on a monitored telephone/speaker phone. The call was documented in a log that is
maintained in the Correctional Systems Department. Mr. Epstein was provided a call because he had not been able
to conduct voice recording on the inmate telephone. This is standard procedure by the Unit Team at MCC New

York, to occasionally provide a call to new arrivals, when necessary.

6. Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until July 24, 2019. While on suicide
watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an Attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m.
During this time, he was without "direct, continuous observation" by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by
P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on
July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for 9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019,
for 10.5 hours; and on July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated. During
these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not maintained as required by MCC New
York's Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation.

Institution Response: 6. Direct Observation:

The Psychology Department has eliminated Psychology Observation at MCC-NY. Inmates on Suicide Watch are
only provided legal visits under special circumstances as deemed by the Court.

7. Follow-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While conducting the 10:00 p.m.

continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When" "©" ]opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr.
Epstein was evaluated by?!" Jat approximately 9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and
likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's
decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP
developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.

Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological
and management-related risks associated with the inmate." Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert
Function states, "When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the
inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are
highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff." Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more
frequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these
groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress
associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,
institutional movement, and release of information through the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New
York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals
Service (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice
indicated Mr. Epstein had "MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies." The USMS requested R&D statt sign the
form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m., DrJi)>\c) |sent Dr.|¢)
mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional infieriation about
this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate
and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when
a staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff
member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is
placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these
conditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. |t\°/c) {for a suicide risk assessment on

August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.

Institution Response: 7. Follow Up:

Staff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant
when they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is
placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.

As part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the following: “If you are emailing about an inmate
that may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation. Please make sure that you make contact

the inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”

The Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with
a history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or
identification, and notj ust when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our
institution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.

R&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified
immediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an
inmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and
Warden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the
general population.

Inmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a
member of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general
population. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates
entering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY
ALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be
notified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to
screen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other
pertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.

Inmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.
Psychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,
but will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex
offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.

The attached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and
implemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follow-up procedures when existing PSY
ALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an
existing PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the
institution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology
Department will also be notified of aPSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology
Department will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These
reports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is
scheduled to go out to court the following day.

When an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department
returns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or
concerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their
return to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to
general population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there
is no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk
assessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.

When an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department
returns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal's Office, they will be screened by a
member of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress
regarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.

Per guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with
R&D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and
suicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology
Services Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting. Further, an e-mail regarding
PSY ALERT procedures was sent to all Lieutenants, Receiving and Discharge (R&D), Psychology and Health
Services staff.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According to a SENTRY quarters roster generated on August
10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to Mr. Epstein's SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him,

b}(6); (bI7 IC)

at the time of his death. However, his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate
i - a and Mr. = aero were all assigned to os same cell. On August 13, 2019,

to cell Z04- 212UAD. Inmate ‘ cell assignment was mS from August L. 2019, until August 11,
2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters history roster was generated for Mr. Epstein on August
13, 2019, at 9:07 a.m. His cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU locator forms were sent to the
cocresional Service ni gps in the Northeast Region. The SHU locator form is dated pig 9, Ao It shows

in cell 206. The photo sheets saw the cell being 220 with inmates Epstein and Reyes'
identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell Z06-220U from August 5,
2019 to August 9, 2019.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are
located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code HO] in SENTRY followed by the four-digit
cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first
revealed Mr. Epstein was in HOI-OOIL according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in
cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells.
SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to HOI-OOIL, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a
general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four
HOI cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional
Service Procedures Manual.

Institution Response: 8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy:
With regard to the accuracy and accountability of inmates placed on suicide watch status in the hospital area,

Psychology Services now runs a daily SENTRY roster of all the inmates on suicide watch in that area. The roster is
examined to ensure that the inmates placed on suicide watch in a suicide watch cell are keyed into SENTRY with


DOJ-OGR-00025122

METADATA_FILENAME: DOJ-OGR-00025123.jpg
----------------------------------------
Page 761

the correct cell assignment noted. The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.
Moreover, the four suicide watch cells now all have SENTRY Assignments of H0O1-001L — HO1-004L. Further,
Psychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants
have conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly
rounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain
and the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.

The Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP30 Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on
suicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments
correctly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the
Lieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that
upon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell
assignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP30 with the selection category for suicide watch. The
Operations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is
in the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate
bed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.

Additionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when
the need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the
Warden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate
whether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of
this determination.

To ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks
are conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP30 Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.
Executive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.
Results will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is
responsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants
Log.

In order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due
to the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along
with a SENTRY PP30 Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish better oversight over inmate
accountability.

Correctional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day
watch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as
prescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,
collecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal 1 or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as
assigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and
responsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll
Call notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.

9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Attorney
Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the
Attorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after
the reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, "In the event of a suicide, institution staff,
particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same
level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred." This policy further states, "All possible

evidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a
psychological reconstruction."

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern. For example, there
were two concurrently open attorney log books in the Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the
two attorney log books, one in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff
were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books
could not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not
consistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled,
log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the
current time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.

Institution Response: 9. Attorney Log Books:

On August 10, 2019, log books deemed relevant to the investigation were removed from various locations
throughout the facility. The Reconstruction Team did identify pertinent logbooks that had not been secured. At this
time, all relevant logbooks have been removed and replaced. In addition, a logbook audit was conducted to ensure
accuracy of the documentation and compliance with policy. Measures are being taken to ensure in the future that all
relevant logbooks are identified, secured immediately and replaced with new ones to ensure the institution can
continue to run efficiently.

10. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution revealed that the list used for
accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and incomplete.

Institution Response: 10: Automatic External Defibrillators:

A review of the Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) report presented by Great Lakes Biomedical Services
dated July 22, 2019, revealed that all AEDS were accounted for and were placed in the correct respective areas. The
report was accurate and complete. New AEDs have been purchased and will be inspected Great Lakes Biomedical
Services upon their arrival. The list reviewed by the reconstruction team was an old and outdated list from January 8, ”
2018.

Medical staff provides training and conducts monthly inspections of all AEDs in the institution. Great Lakes
Biomedical Services, an outside contractor, conducts a bi-annual inspection and provides a report. Procedures on
inspecting all AEDS in the institution have been prepared and are awaiting approval. These procedures are attached
hereto.

11. Post Orders & SHU Training: SHU Post Orders Sign- -In Sheets were reviewed for the 3rd Quarter, spanning June
9, 2019, to September 7, 2019. Offices?"

Quarterly SHU Training Sign-In Sheets were reviewed. The 2019 3rd Quarter SHU Training was conducted on June
6, 2019. Three staff assigned to the 3rd Quarter SHU Roster in SHU did not attend or receive the SHU Training:

Institution Response: |1. Post Orders & SHU Training:

The Suicide Watch Post Orders are located in the Lieutenant’s Office and SHU with a quarterly sign-in sheet. A
copy of the Suicide Watch Post Orders will also be placed in a secure container outside of the suicide watch cells
on Tier H in SHU. This container will also hold signature sheets and additional Staff Suicide Watch Log Books.

All staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the
staff suicide watch. Attached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permitting staff monitored suicide watches in
SHU.

With regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. However, the
sign-in sheets for this training are now be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is
assigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the
Chief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.

SHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from
Psychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will
be completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be allotted time during that day to
complete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not
received the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to attend another training day as
assigned by the Captain.

Staff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be
maintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence
immediately upon the initiation of watch. It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a
blank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each
log book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall
be clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are
made.

During some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In
this instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant
visual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual
observation (yellow). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion
log book every 60 minutes.

Lights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will
make rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,
eating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not
prescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.

The inmate will be outfitted in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive mattress.
and if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate
Companions are not allowed to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them
from maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on
suicide watch.

12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the
staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing

the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory
psychologist to provide critical clinical services.

Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this
topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.

Institution Response: 12. Staffing:

The Drug Abuse Coordinator position is currently a shared position. The Warden has re-established the Drug Abuse
Coordinator position as a full-time position to provide the Psychology Department with an additional supervisory
psychologist to perform critical clinical services. At the current time, the position is pending selection.

We are currently in the process of requesting to hire a Staff Psychologist position to provide additional psychological
services to inmates in the SHU, including therapy sessions with PSY ALERT, CC2-MH and CC3-MH inmates who
are currently housed there. An additional psychologist could also monitor Hot List inmates arriving to the SHU and
ensure they are housed with appropriate cellmates. This psychologist could conduct daily rounds to look for signs of
psychological distress and address the concerns of our Long Term SHU inmates. Finally, an additional Staff
Psychologist could assist with our daily crisis interventions and suicide risk assessments.

New York. did not appear to be present in all staff but was vital to his adjustment and safety in prison. A more

Institution Response: 13. Sex Offense Risk Factors:

The Chief Psychologist is a member of the Executive Staff. The Chief Psychologist or her designee continues to be
present at all Executive Staff meetings, Department Head meetings, and SHU meetings. During these meetings, the
Chief Psychologist offers feedback regarding the treatment and management of sex offender inmates. Additionally,
the Chief Psychologist continues to educate all staff during Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT) and
Annual Training (AT) about the sex offender specific risk factors and suicidality.

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic
information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get
either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with
someone?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided b)’"”"""” —_| Chief Psychologist. He
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
and will be celled with inmate*’?°"""

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because
he requested Protective Custody.

had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom | saw him
interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention.
He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at
the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in
the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had
planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

While | will probably reply to this reporter with something like my draft below which doesn't reveal much if
anything, nonetheless we want to be sure we understand from you or the institution what if anything may
have happened with inmate Epstein. Could you see if the institution can look into this and provide us with
what they may know for our internal purposes (not for release to media)? We will reply to media inquiries
about Epstein (not the institution) since stories about him are national news (unless we finalize an answer that
we could give to the institution to use as well if media ask about this tomorrow).

PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were
not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations
by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special
Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since
the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the
beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely
limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish
converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,
information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support
actionable findings and recommendations is limited.

Name: Jeffrey Epstein

Register Number: 76318-054

Date of Death: 08-10-2019

Prepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator,

Psychology Services Branch, Central Office

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Mr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August 10, 2019, while housed
at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills,
former Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a
psychological reconstruction. The team consisted of National Suicide Prevention
Coordinator, Central Office Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator,
since lealth Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and
Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This
reconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement

5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.

Social History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of
the reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.
The following was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in 1953
and grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,
Brooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein
graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969, at the age of 16. He attended Cooper Union and
New York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,
a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from September 1974 until he was

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a
number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at

Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a
financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

Mr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a
consultant with}? in the late 1980s. [°° O'%™

first mentor. was later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi
scheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his own
personal use. Years later’? Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,
granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as{?°'""
mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million
dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his
considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence
and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In

June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count
Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for
Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration
and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the
National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month
incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he
followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (a), (b) (2), 2
on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females
over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited
minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated
with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor
females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not
guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman
on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others
and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s
proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held
on remand.

Institutional History: On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in

New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this
arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that
evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22
hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit
(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness
of his notoriety among the inmate population.

With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report
while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident
report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether

Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s
prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate
Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION
BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with
hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis

unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,

omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the
prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.
However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”
thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications
prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine
which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP
machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

In regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no known available records. Any
records that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were
not available for review as of the dite ot this report. With regard to Psychology Data System
witch Forensic Psychologist at
MCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2019. During this screening,
Mr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No
symptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level 1 and
was not diagnosed with a mental illness.

Following a consulta

should be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary
consideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and

media attention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.

Mr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal

thoughts at that time, but due to the potential for other risk factors listed above, the on-call
psychologist placed Mr. Epstein on Psychological Observation in one of the suicide watch cells
until he could be assessed in person by a BOP psychologist. Psychological Observation is a
form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates
who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive
housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their
transition and safety after an acute suicidal crisis. On July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a
formal, in-person suicide risk assessment with/°"’''’""" | She determined that, while suicide
watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation
status out of an abundance of caution. He was removed from Psychological Observation on
July 10, 2019.

Mr. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes.
Thereafter, he remained in the suicide watch cell and was placed on Psychological Observation,
where he remained housed until July 30, 2019, according to PDS-BEMR records. A discrepancy
exists regarding when he was removed from Psychological Observation. His cell assignment,
per SENTRY, indicates he was transferred back to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on

July 29, 2019, whereas PDS-BEMR indicates he was removed from Psychological Observation
on July 30, 2019, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

Mr. Epstein attended a court hearing on July 31, 2019, and, upon his return, the United States
Marshals Service (USMS) provided paperwork to Receiving and Discharge (R&D) staff that
noted “suicidal tendencies.) °°" as notified on August 1, 2019, about this paperwork.
She consulted with®’'°""" and then met with Mr. Epstein to conduct a suicide risk
assessment. She determined suicide watch was not warranted at that time.

Mr. Epstein remained classified as a Mental Health Care Level 1 throughout his time at

MCC New York. During his contacts with psychologists, Mr. Epstein routinely denied current
mental health symptoms to include suicidal ideation, and he did not exhibit symptoms of a
serious mental illness. However, there was evidence Mr. Epstein was experiencing challenges

adjusting to his environment and changes in his lifestyle. He reported frequent complaints of
difficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided
to him on July 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At
times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit.
On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described himself as a coward and as
someone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2019, he told)" [the toilet in his cell would
not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his
hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was
unable to sleep that night.

ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual
offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged
sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019,
Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

A er 31 hours and

from Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. This
e-mail was sent to 71 MCC New York staff and, as of August 13, 2019, only 27 staff members
had opened the message.

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the
public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book
order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for
Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their
Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The
documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who
alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was
Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.
According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days
although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist
and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and
the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A
social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein,
knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with
him.

Following his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein was moved into
his SHU cell. He was single-celled at that time because his cellmate (Efrain Reyes #85993-054)

DESCRIPTION OF SCENE

A detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered

Mr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report
of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in
the SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called
for medical assistance, activated the|”””’ and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff
stated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED
reportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to
Health Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at
6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:10 a.m. Mr. Epstein was
pronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing
video footage.

CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when
reviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,
were likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in
individuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of
sexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to
utilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative
affect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the
loss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the
loss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide
among individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,
and lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.

Mr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He
had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he
accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many
associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared

to cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother.
Indeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, power, and association with other high-
profile individuals.|"'""”

In the weeks

before his death, he made statements that he was “a coward” and was having difficulty adapting
to his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to
tolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were
unsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some
of his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status
in both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in
prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.

continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. Whe opened the e-mail the following
Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by POO at approximately

9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant
disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt
to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist
should have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The
BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.
Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider
the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”
Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to
move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate
are reviewed and considered by Esyohology SEIVAGES staff [and] any safety and securit

Both of these groups of inmates are
susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience
stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,
movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through
the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he
departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in
SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)
provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The
notice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The
USMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and the departed with the signed copy.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According toa SENTRY quarters

roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to
Mr. Epstein’s SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However,

until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters history

assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU
locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region.
The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate DTIC) in cell 207L

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The
suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit
code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified
by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed
Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books
indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while
there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to
HO1-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general
population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch
cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing
Format, only shows three cells.

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required
by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death.
Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby
areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not
secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the
reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a
suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law
enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime
scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence
and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent
investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic
concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the
Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one
in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff
were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the
reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,
entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and
out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently
labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been
torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an
adequate system of control and monitoring.

10. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution
revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and
incomplete.

Good afternoon,

Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special
housing unit until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in
court and upon his arrival will be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this
inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to
go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on
Suicide Watch.

There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged
around the back side of our building and in front of the court house which is less then 100 yards apart from
each other.

lf you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thank you

| just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment
with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the
day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case,
he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has
multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted with?’ °'"" Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has
various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-
trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal
situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been
informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the
aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein ona
watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by ~~" —Ss||Chief Psychologist. He
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

| visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so |
had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom | saw him
interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention.
He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at
the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in
the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had
planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or

My apologies, but | have been away from my desk in meetings the past three days. | received your
voicemails regarding the status of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation
continues, any personal property attributable to Mr. Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside
investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family as expeditiously as possible.

If you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to
chat further.

Thank you,

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his
attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had
a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any
mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was
asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various
needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker
phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not
depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting
with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

Findings

The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical
assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their
own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is
COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by}”"
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
and will be celled with inmate|*“’""”

| just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment
with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the
day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case,
he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has
multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted wit entral Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has
various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-
trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal
situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been
informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the
aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein ona
watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Thanks,

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday
morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death
(Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-
mail me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

Thanks.

| just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment
with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the
day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case,
he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has
multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted with = entral Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has
various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-
trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal
situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been
informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the
aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein ona
watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Good afternoon,

Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special
housing unit until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in
court and upon his arrival will be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this
inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to
go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on
Suicide Watch.

There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged
around the back side of our building and in front of the court house which is less then 100 yards apart from
each other.

If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thank you

cl made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert.
Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an
ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring
that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere
with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is
between you and them and not my business.

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein
received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29" after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-
New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on
suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that
he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9", In addition, the
SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

On August 9" at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court
appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return

to the institution. On August 9". Enstein was in a legal visit with his lawvers all dav until oma

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an

that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere

Is there any reason why this information shouldn’t be released to the public?

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein
received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29" after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-
New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on
suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that
he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9", In addition, the
SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

On August 9" at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court
appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return

to the institution. On August 9". Enstein was in a legal visit with his lawvers all dav until oma

““'T made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert.
Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an
ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring
that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere
with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is
between you and them and not my business.
