received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 2gth Epstein was removed from suicide watch by Psychology Services Department at
MCC-New York after daily interaction with him and according to established procedures.

On August 9" at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate was taken out of the institution fora

Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not
return to the institution. On August gth Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day
until 6:45 p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cellmate even though Epstein was on PSYCH

Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an
ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring
that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere
with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for

7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for

as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all

this, I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Good morning all. | apologize | was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Office called me just
before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. | was
whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction.

informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not
required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement
for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. | had recently updated the Psychological
Observation Procedural Memorandum which | will attach here. | have not updated the SW supplement for
several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer.

s requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for
the sign-in sheets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch.
Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post
orders, | think we should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on
inmate Epstein signed for the quarter.

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

s discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse/?"®! | saw him.
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. | infor

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal toda’

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another
cell.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit | suggest based on PDS is to delete the text | colored red and
replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from
court and was assessed the next morning.

>>> Hugh Hurwitz 8/12/2019 1:17 PM >>>
Please review for accuracy before | send tq°"")'""""

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for
evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not
warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I’ve seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing
shortages, overtime and this incident.

staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a
lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US
Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I’ve seen additional press reports
trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

From: Hugh Hurwitz ®bop.gov>
Sent: Sunday, August 11, ani is a PM

this. I will need io ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Subject: Epstein arrival at MCC

Attachments: TEXT.htm

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

21°.) here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another

Please review for accuracy before | send to/®@)

ere is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

Please review for accuracy before | send to}; ><;

ere is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for
evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not
warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

Epstein arrival at MCC

From Hugh Hurwitz

To Ray Ormond, Kb y(6); (BMF WC)
Date 2019/08/12 13:52
Subject: Epstein arrival at MCC

Attachments: TEXT. htm

&ere is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no plans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc
Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24
hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

Hello, P’'m working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against
ai . ’'ve spoken to an AFGE union official an(’”
attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I’d appreciate a response by COB today.

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification
of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note
that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not
been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.

(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein’s death?

(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I’ve seen additional press reports
trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

Thanks,

this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit | suggest based on PDS is to delete the text | colored red and
replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from
court and was assessed the next morning.

>>> Hugh Hurwitz 8/12/2019 1:17 PM >>>

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that
he was coming so no pkans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for
his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for
evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not
warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic
information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we could
speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and
Assistant Warden.

He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited

A couple of issues came out of the Epstein Reconstruction which | wanted to problem solve when you have
an opportunity to meet:

Other issues regarding the SW program:

1. We need to ensure the Unit 2 Officer is making rounds each hour and signing the log book. While the
officer is back there, if an inmate companion needs to utilize the bathroom he should be allowed to do so.
Inmate Companions have been urinating in the garbage cans out of desperation.

2. Inmates on suicide watch need to be fed as timely as possible.

3. Inmates on suicide watch need to receive showers on M, W, and F.

4. Suicide Watch mattresses are being taken from our area to be used in GP. They are specialized and
expensive mattresses.

5. If my orderly brings dirty smocks to the elevator, can internal bring them to the laundry in the basement?
Dirty Smocks are getting misplaced or thrown away.

6. Lt.'s need to strip out the inmate going on suicide watch and thoroughly search the inmate companions
coming down for contraband and inappropriate items. If the inmate companions bring down contraband
for the inmates on Suicide Watch, they will be terminated.

7. Lt." need to search the suicide watch room before inmates go into the room on suicide watch.

8. Lt.'s need to ensure inmates on suicide watch are placed in a smock without clothing, glasses, etc. unless
otherwise indicated by a psychologist and with on the front of the log book.

hope you are well. We saw an article tonight on someting called Radaronline
reporting that Jeffrey Epstein attempted to commit suicide at the MCC
(unsuccessfully.)

Are you in a position to help me on that with some sort of confirmation or

information. (Or to dispel its veracity?) thanks,

Subject: Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054
Attachments: TEXT.htm

Good Morning:

| would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be
delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference?

Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every
hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate?

Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other
inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch
which is sent up from food service every morning.

Please provide a response.

Thank You,

Good Morning:

| would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be
delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference?

Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every
hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate?

Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other
inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch
which is sent up from food service every morning.

Please provide a response.

Thank You,

prry to bother you with this:

Update: We got over 30 inquiries. My boss is drafting a very short answer that will probably say we don't
comment on an inmate's health status or conditions of confinement for privacy reasons.

My boss had me call MCC NY just now to be sure they are not releasing varying statements to the media, we
want the institution & me to use the same exact statement to all media (we'll give them the statement we
come up with shortly and be sure they're fine with it) and they just told me you're acting will call me back
shortly.

Last thing - | didn't realize he went to the hospital, | might ask your acting exec. if he's still at the hospital or
how long there, etc., if that's true (news article say he went to a hospital).

Attachments: TEXT.htm, Certification of Identify Form.pdf

Good morning

| spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's
subpoena Is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death
in this context. Once | receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, | will have the USAO's Civil Division
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462
(1951) and the associated regulations.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Internal Notes:

The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The
BOP has an extensive Suicide Prevention Program that begins upon an inmate’s arrival at each BOP
facility, including pretrial facilities such as MCC New York. See BOP Program Statement 5324.08 "Suicide
Prevention Program" here https://www.bop. gov/policy/progstat/5324 008.pdfand BOP Program

Statement 5310.17 "Psychology Services Manual" here
https://www.bop. gov/policy/progstat/5310_017.pdf. During the initial intake screening by medical
staff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately

notified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place
an inmate on suicide watch.

The Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program
Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance
with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral,
assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly
restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for
housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's
Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without
compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to
the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects,
materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are
evaluated daily by apsychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions.
Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist
following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.

With regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654
correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and
retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. The
BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess
any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.

The factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors
include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a
plan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.

SHU, and Epstein’s cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would
appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given
the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and

Focus of Session

He was seen by writer while he was on Psych Observation.

iv jective Presentation
The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12
hours per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the "Eating/Shower Chart” may not reflect
all of his meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water
at night. The Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept.

this.

When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist
with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse }>'!'@(°

He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and
upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was
not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got
with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism
spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also
really good with numbers.

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a mildly anxious mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and
coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual
hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior.
He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff and Inmate Companions if he
starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to
self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff and Inmate Companions if he has these thoughts.

Intervention(s)

Supportive and educative interventions were again provided. He had not been given the Turning Point handouts
yesterday that were on his cell door, so they were handed to him by staff today.

Progress/Plan

He will remain on Psych Observation in an abundance of caution and pending housing arrangements to be made on
Monday. While on Psych Observation, he will be seen daily by Psychology.

Changes in Risk Factors Assessed

Upon a review of the log book, it was indicated Mr. EPSTEIN has been speaking to the inmate companions about
having previously taught mathematics and physics. He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating,
and drinking within normal limits.

Upon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shower. His requests were
made known to the lieutenants and he was provided a shower prior to attending his legal visit. This writer also provided
him a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products.

Reason for Removal from Watch

Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "| have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his
being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include
interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not
do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than
in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be
re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU
and asked if there were a "safer" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr.
EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on
Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for
one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this
information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.

Diagnosis:
No Diagnosis, No Dx - Current

Conclusions
The Overall Acute Suicide Risk for this Inmate is: Low
Overall Chronic Suicide Risk for this Inmate is: Absent

suicide.

The following STATIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate’s risk for engaging in suicide related
behaviors: Sex offender status, Lack of family connections, High Profile Crime

Of the DYNAMIC risk factors assessed, none were found to be present.

The following PROTECTIVE factors were assessed to be present and may decrease the inmate's risk of suicide:Willingness to
engage in treatment, View of death as negative, Future orientation, Denial of suicidal ideation/intention/plans, Adequate problem
solving skills, Able to identify reasons to live

As noted above, Inmate Epstein is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time

proceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this
writer that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.

Despite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly
denied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his
attorney, to take a shower, and to brush his teeth. He was eating his cereal when this writer arrived and said "| have my paper

positive outlook regarding his legal case, demonstrates no psychiatric symptoms, has no psychiatric or suicide history, and
verbalized a desire to be alive at this time and future orientation.

DAG Rosenstein were also acutely aware of), over the 5 years leading into this administration our prison
population had dropped 40,000 inmates, but our staffing had gone up (and pop has continued to drop
another almost 9,000 since the start of the Administration)! The drop in staffing that they are referring to
also likely includes the 5156 unfunded vacant positions that were eliminated...positions we never could fill in
the first place.

Subject: Last contact with Epstein

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after
the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied
any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the
time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not
depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

CASE NUMBER: M-19-019432

NAME OF DECEDENT: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD

(AUTOPSY PERFORMED By?" °"” IN 8/11/2019)

MACROSCOPIC EXAMINATION (PERFORMED By °°"
ATTENDANCE, ON 8/20/2019):

The unfixed brain weighs 1520g (expected, 1200-1500g). Examination of the fixed brain (minus
the left occipital pole, removed at the time of autopsy for possible toxicology) shows normal
leptemeninges. No contusions, stigmata of herniation, or other surface abnormalities are seen.
External brainstem landmarks and cranial nerves are normal. Vessels at the base are distributed
normally, and have no atherosclerosis. The cerebellum is normal.

Coronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres reveal normal cortical ribbon, white matter, and deep
gray nuclei. There is no midline shift. Hippocampi are symmetrical and of normal volume.
Ventricles are normal in size and appearance.

Axial sections of the brainstem and cerebellum en bioc show the substantia nigra and locus
ceruleus to be well-pigmented. The aqueduct and fourth ventricle are normal. Cerebellar cortex,
white matter, and dentate are normal.

Cranial dura from the convexities, tentorium, and base shows falcine ossification (comment
common age-related finding}. The venous sinuses and tributary (bridging) veins are patent.

Spinal cord and dura from upper cervical! to cauda equina levels show no abnormality, externally
or on midsagittal section.

PHOTOGRAPHS: YES
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: NO

MEMORANDUM

Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York

DATE: August 10, 2019

TO: Charisma Edge, Associate Warden Programs

Psy.D., Ph.D., Forensic Psychologist} Ps, PP4b

SUBJECT: Epstein #76301-054

This memo summarizes the psychology contacts with Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Epstein arrived on July 8, 2019, and was seen by psychology services for an intake screening in SHU. He
denied any psychology history or symptoms. The Chief Psychologist spoke with Central Office on July 8, 2019,
and it was determined he should be placed on suicide watch and seen for a suicide risk assessment after he
returns from court due to his increased suicide risk factors. Mr. Epstein was seen on July 9, 2019, for a suicide
risk assessment where he denied any suicide ideation, intention, or plan. Despite his risk factors of his sex
offence charge, high profile case with media attention, and pretrial status housed in SHU, his protective factors
outweighed his risk factors. He was future oriented, wanted to fight his case, and denied any mental health
history or suicidality. He was removed from suicide watch and placed on psychology observation. He was seen
the following day at which time he requested to be celled alone if housed in SHU and was told he could not. Mr.
Epstein was released from psychology observation and seen on July 11, 2019, in attorney conference. He
expressed concerns such as wearing an orange jumpsuit, not receiving medication, and not having enough water
during attorney visits. Mr. Epstein was seen one week later, July 16, 2019, for follow up and because he was
asking to be seen. He did not express any psychological concerns, rather correctional issues such as not getting
a phone call and needing a spoon. An attempt at a SHU review was made on, July 18, 2019; however, Mr.
Epstein was with his legal team.

iio Mr. Epstein was seen daily while on psychology observation, each day denying he was suicidal.
During one interview, he claimed he could not remember what happened because of his “sleep apnea.” On July
30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from psychology observation and returned to SHU. He reported he did not
think he could sleep in SHU because of the noise. He denied any psychological concerns. It was noted he
would be placed with a cellmate.

~ On July 31, 2019, Mr. Epstein was seen for a psychology observation follow up. He stated he was doing as well
as can be expected given his circumstances and reported he was going to court for a status hearing. He also
reported he slept well. Mr. Epstein was seen for another suicide risk assessment on August I, 2019, at

approximately Ipm, as he returned from court with a note from the court indicating “suicidal tendencies.” Mr.

about the noise in SHU, Mr. Epstein’s protective factors outweighed his
€ was not placed on suicide watch. He denied suicidal ideation, reported fighting his case,
stated he has emotional support, and stated suicide is against his religion.

would continue to be seen for weekly rounds.

the inmate would be transported to the morgue so we escorted the staff to the morgue. While|in the
morgue, we still maintained direct supervision of the inmate until approximately 12:57pm. At this time,
the inmate was no longer under our direct supervision as medical staff took over. Operations Lieutenant
was notified and we were instructed to report back to the institution — we arrived at 1:03pm.

I know this sounds like pure paranoia, But I have a strange feeling something might happen to Epstein, I've also heard (BG) OME) Jas recently been

Major alleged criminals in close proximity can be dangerous.
especially with 2 conflicting individuals who have a huge impact on our current environment.

I don't know about you but if I was an angry prisoner and was given an opportunity to hurt a child sex trafficker, as a parent, you never know what could.
All I'm asking is please take precaution and be careful.
I would prefer if his case goes to court, and he stays alive after his alleged cult-like island and all the people connected/ Involved to get the same.

PD 1/7/2020 7:52 AM >>>

Epstein didn’t kill himself, and Ag Barr is lying.... Well | guess more misleading is appropriate way of
saying it (Lying through obfuscation). No one was “on camera” that could have went to Epstein’s cell.
Barr “has watched the videos.” What he left out is that if you know the camera’s timing and locations
you could easily get to Epstein’s cell easily. In fact 2-3 men (F.orB.illionairesl.nterests agents) could pass
through the camera holes on their way to kill Epstein. So in order to debunk this “conspiracy theory”
please release the camera type and capabilities of each camera, service records, repairs and upgrades.
Can probably find this by going through your public budget/spending info, but thought this might be a
quicker way. Now | understand you wouldn’t want to give out location of cameras and | fully
understand the need for that. Cameras pan, tilt, zoom in and could very easily create “holes” for people
to go undetected. Yep there’d have to be many of you corrupt to pull this off and well that just adds to
the credibility of my claims. Most of you are corrupt. Why was every “news’ outlet reporting for WEEKS
that two cameras were out and there was no correction to the story from anyone? Then Ag Barr claims
to have watched all videos and says no one enter that area. Except you could get there without being
on camera. So, technically he didn’t lie, but he is trying to cover it up with completely misleading
statements. Oh, and there was one camera out, the one pointed at his cell. Did he watch only a few
hours, or a day or two prior? Criminals will wait and do crazy things in order to achieve their goals. | can
only imagine the lengths the sick wealthy pedos in power and corrupt underlings would do to keep
themselves safe. Just look at the ongoing coup by traitors. They’d do much worse than any criminal |
am sure. Wait 1-?? days hidden to kill someone ABSOLUTELY!

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by} ‘| Chief Psychologist. He
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided b

Chief Psychologist. He

will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a

serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

and will be celled with inmate?"

Subject: Epstein Update
Attachments: TEXT. htm

Good morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his
neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is
aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in
his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate
| told him he
can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned
to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another
cell.

Thanks,

will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He © has a ager incident oon tor Self: Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the

placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm

functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a
number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at

Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a
financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

Mr. Epstein had two sig enificant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a

granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Nicest also being identified ape

mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million
dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his
considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence
and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In

June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count
Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for
Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration
and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the
National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month
incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he
followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (a), (b) (2), 2
on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females
over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited
minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated
with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor
females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not
guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman
on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others
and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s
proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held
on remand.

----------------------------------------
Institutional History: On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in

New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this
arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that
evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22
hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit
(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness
of his notoriety among the inmate population.

Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s
prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate
Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION

BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with
hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis
unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,
omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the
prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.
However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”
thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications
prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine
which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP
machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

He reported frequent complaints of

y did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided
to him on Tuly. 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At
times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or ona general population housing unit.
On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described himself as a coward and as
someone who does not like pain. On July 28,2019, he told == the toilet in his cell would
not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his
hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was
unable to sleep that night.

ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual
offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged
sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019,
Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the
public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book
order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for
Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their
Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The
documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who
alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was
Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.
According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days
although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist
and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and
the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A
social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein,
knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with
him.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by|°"""~
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
ing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate|"'°"""’

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because
he requested Protective Custody.

addition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The Contractor/Volunteer Log
Book was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; however, the time of

All staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the
staff suicide watch. Attached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permitting staff monitored suicide watches in
SHU.

With regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. However, the
sign-in sheets for this training are now be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is
assigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the
Chief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.

SHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from
Psychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will
be completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be allotted time during that day to
complete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not
received the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to attend another training day as
assigned by the Captain.

Staff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be
maintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence
immediately upon the initiation of watch. It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a
blank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each
log book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall
be clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are
made.

During some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In
this instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant
visual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual
observation (yellow). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion
log book every 60 minutes.

Lights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will
make rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,
eating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not
prescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.

The inmate will be outfitted in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive mattress.
and if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate
Companions are not allowed to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them
from maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on
suicide watch.

12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the
staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing

the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory
psychologist to provide critical clinical services.

Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this
topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.

Institution Response: 12. Staffing:

The Drug Abuse Coordinator position is currently a shared position. The Warden has re-established the Drug Abuse
Coordinator position as a full-time position to provide the Psychology Department with an additional supervisory
psychologist to perform critical clinical services. At the current time, the position is pending selection.

We are currently in the process of requesting to hire a Staff Psychologist position to provide additional psychological
services to inmates in the SHU, including therapy sessions with PSY ALERT, CC2-MH and CC3-MH inmates who
are currently housed there. An additional psychologist could also monitor Hot List inmates arriving to the SHU and
ensure they are housed with appropriate cellmates. This psychologist could conduct daily rounds to look for signs of
psychological distress and address the concerns of our Long Term SHU inmates. Finally, an additional Staff
Psychologist could assist with our daily crisis interventions and suicide risk assessments.

13. Sex Offense Risk Factors: A broad understanding of risk factors associated with sex offenders, by staffat MCC
New York, did not appear to be present in all staff but was vital to his adjustment and safety in prison. A more

Institution Response: 13. Sex Offense Risk Factors:

The Chief Psychologist is a member of the Executive Staff. The Chief Psychologist or her designee continues to be
present at all Executive Staff meetings, Department Head meetings, and SHU meetings. During these meetings, the
Chief Psychologist offers feedback regarding the treatment and management of sex offender inmates. Additionally,
the Chief Psychologist continues to educate all staff during Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT) and
Annual Training (AT) about the sex offender specific risk factors and suicidality.

If you happen to get this tonight, maybe you can call me on my cell at 202-32)?'°'., _| My boss may want to
answer this reporter tonight, but before we send an answer perhaps like the one below we wanted to see for
our own internal awareness what you may know about this if any of it is true in regard to Epstein.

My mobile Samsung is not always receiving emails and leaving work now, so my personal cell by calling the
number above is best if you get this.

Thanks s SO much,

While | will probably reply to this reporter with something like my draft below which doesn't reveal much if
anything, nonetheless we want to be sure we understand from you or the institution what if anything may
have happened with inmate Epstein. Could you see if the institution can look into this and provide us with
what they may know for our internal purposes (not for release to media)? We will reply to media inquiries
about Epstein (not the institution) since stories about him are national news (unless we finalize an answer that
we could give to the institution to use as well if media ask about this tomorrow).

Upon a review of the log book, it was indicated Mr. EPSTEIN has been speaking to the inmate companions about
having previously taught mathematics and physics. He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating,
and drinking within normal limits.

Upon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shower. His requests were
made known to the lieutenants and he was provided a shower prior to attending his legal visit. This writer also provided
him a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products.

Reason for Removal from Watch

Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "| have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his
being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include
interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not
do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than
in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be
re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU
and asked if there were a "safer" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr.
EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on
Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for
one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this
information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.

The Overall Acute Suicide Risk for this Inmate is: Low

MEMORANDUM

Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York

DATE: August 10, 2019

TO: Charisma Edge, Associate Warden Programs

Psy.D., Ph.D., Forensic Psychologist} Ps, PP4b

SUBJECT: Epstein #76301-054

This memo summarizes the psychology contacts with Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Epstein arrived on July 8, 2019, and was seen by psychology services for an intake screening in SHU. He
denied any psychology history or symptoms. The Chief Psychologist spoke with Central Office on July 8, 2019,
and it was determined he should be placed on suicide watch and seen for a suicide risk assessment after he
returns from court due to his increased suicide risk factors. Mr. Epstein was seen on July 9, 2019, for a suicide
risk assessment where he denied any suicide ideation, intention, or plan. Despite his risk factors of his sex
offence charge, high profile case with media attention, and pretrial status housed in SHU, his protective factors
outweighed his risk factors. He was future oriented, wanted to fight his case, and denied any mental health
history or suicidality. He was removed from suicide watch and placed on psychology observation. He was seen
the following day at which time he requested to be celled alone if housed in SHU and was told he could not. Mr.
Epstein was released from psychology observation and seen on July 11, 2019, in attorney conference. He
expressed concerns such as wearing an orange jumpsuit, not receiving medication, and not having enough water
during attorney visits. Mr. Epstein was seen one week later, July 16, 2019, for follow up and because he was
asking to be seen. He did not express any psychological concerns, rather correctional issues such as not getting
a phone call and needing a spoon. An attempt at a SHU review was made on, July 18, 2019; however, Mr.
Epstein was with his legal team.

During one interview, he claimed he could not remember what happened because of his “sleep apnea.” On July
30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from psychology observation and returned to SHU. He reported he did not
think he could sleep in SHU because of the noise. He denied any psychological concerns. It was noted he
would be placed with a cellmate.
