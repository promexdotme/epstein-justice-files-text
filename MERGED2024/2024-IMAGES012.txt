Epstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars.
Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was
waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage.
Robson stated “I know” and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.

The victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein’s picture placed in position five. The victim
immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated
simultaneously.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the
Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone
561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The
victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the
more you get paid.” Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified,
and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the
victim’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at
Epstein’s house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.

It should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the
house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the E] Brillo house in which
Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate.

During the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach.
Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our
arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to
Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time
she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein.
Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within
the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson
made the comment “ I’m like a Heidi Fliess”. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in
California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On November 7, 2005, I made contact with P| at her home. During a sworn taped
statement tated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson would approach females who
wished to work for him. MMB stated she was offered to work for him but declined. BE tained that
“work” means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no.

said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein’s house to provide massages.
further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl
was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked.
It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the
request, just to tell him and he would stop. PE stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought
over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim,
stated she looked really young, fifteen years old at the most. BN sucthes stated she did not know
the victim personally stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson.

As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and
based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts
to a victim under the age of 16.

RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS

The top donations to gov. elect Bill
Richardson's campaign came from:

ile

Labor unions: $633,488

The top union donor was AFSCME,
the public-employee's labor group,
which gave $300,000 in cash
contributions. AFSCME also produced
its own radio and television ads
during the Republican primary that
were critical of GOP candidates.

AFSCME is angling to persuade the
Legislature and the governor to
reinstate collective bargaining for
state employees. Outgoing Gov.
Gary Johnson allowed the previous
agreement to expire, and Richardson
has promised to work on a new
agreement.

The Communication Workers of
America, which represents several
thousand employees in New Mexico,
contributed $100,000 through its
political action committee in New
Mexico. The American Federation of
Teachers, one of two national
teachers unions that represents New
Mexico educators, gave $50,000.

Gambling interests: $648,392
This is a significant development in
New Mexico campaign finances. In a
matter of five years, gambling
money has become one of the top
influences in state politics.

The top gambling contributor was
the Downs at Albuquerque, which
donated $100,000.

The Downs has a relationship with
the state because the racing license
is regulated by the state Racing
Commission. The Downs also

by the state Gaming Control Board.

The Downs also rents the racetrack
and casino facilities from the New
Mexico State Fair. The state recently
sued the Downs on behalf of the
State Fair for more than $100,000 in
back rent that has not been paid.

Paul Blanchard, the president of the
Downs, was a key player in helping
Richardson raise campaign money.
He donated $10,000 of his own
money. Blanchard's wife, Kandace,
also donated $10,000.

Other major gambling contributors
include Riviera Gaming Management
Inc., a Las Vegas corporation that is
working with partners in New
Mexico, including Ken Newton, to get
a license to open a horse racetrack
and casino in Hobbs. Riviera donated
$50,000 to Richardson's campaign.

The Pueblo of Sandia contributed
$56,148 in cash and in-kind
donations to Richardson. Sandia
operates the state's largest tribal
casino.

Richardson also attracted $51,000
from the New Democrat Network, a
political group that embraces
centrist Democrats.

Richardson also received $12,751 in Mipbl E EAST

4. Richardson's congressional
account: $289,315
Richardson transferred all of the
money from the bank account he
previously used for his congressional
campaigns in the state's 3rd
Congressional District in northern
New Mexico.

Richardson had fought in court in
the early 1990s for the right to
transfer money from a federal
campaign account to a state
account, even though the state
constitution bans the practice. The
state Supreme Court ruled that the
constitutional provision violated the
federal constitution.

5. Peters Corporation: $138,376
Gerald Peters, owner of the Peters
Gallery in Santa Fe, is a close friend
of Richardson.

In addition to $102,000 in cash
contributions donated to the
campaign, Peters also flew
Richardson in his private plane
during several campaign swings
around the state. He also provided
food and beverages for an event and
donated art. Those in-kind
contributions amounted to $35,000

Epstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars.
Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was
waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage.
Robson stated “I know” and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.

The victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein’s picture placed in position five. The victim
immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated
simultaneously.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the
Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone
561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The
victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the
more you get paid.” Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified,
and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the
victim’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at
Epstein’s house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.

It should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the
house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which
Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate.

During the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach.
Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our
arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to
Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time
she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein.
Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida
before me this 20 day of September, 2005 by County of Palm Beach
Det. Joe Recarey ,who is personally known to me.

She was told she would have to provide a massage and would make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer
and agreed to meet with Jeffrey. Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) Picked her up
and was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of
the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main
bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein’s bedroom . Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with
a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and
informed her Jeff would be in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He laid on the table onto
his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He tried
to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how did he tried to touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt
uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told
Epstein, I'll massage you but I don’t want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I know you’re not
comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once
tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson was asked how

many girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she
(oT sy SMI ond the victim in this case

I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim was the youngest. Robson
stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a
massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if the victim was aware. She stated every girl
she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew the victim wanted to make money . She
approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The victim agreed and arrangements were
made to bring the victim to Epstein’s house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and (Later identified as

through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein’s assistant Sarah. The victim was introduced
to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. Sarah led the victim upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When
the massage was over, the victim returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bring the

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within
the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson
made the comment “ I’m like a Heidi Fliess”. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in
California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On November 7, 2005, I made contact with her home. During a sworn taped
statemen| stated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson would approach females who
wished to work for him stated she was offered to work for him but declined JM explained that
“work” means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no.

said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein’s house to provide massages.
further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl
was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked.
It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the
request, just to tell him and he would co ca Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought
over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim,

BE tated she looked ~ young, fifteen years old at the most. [further stated she did not know

the victim personally, stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson.

As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and
based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts
to a victim under the age of 16.

-trIB HOME |— | RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN

CONTRIBUTIONS

The top donations to gov. elect Bill
Richardson's campaign came from:

1.

Labor unions: $633,488

The top union donor was AFSCME,
the public-employee's labor group,
which gave $300,000 in cash
contributions. AFSCME also produced
its own radio and television ads
during the Republican primary that
were critical of GOP candidates.

AFSCME is angling to persuade the
Legislature and the governor to
reinstate collective bargaining for
state employees. Outgoing Gov.
Gary Johnson allowed the previous
agreement to expire, and Richardson
has promised to work on a new
agreement.

The Communication Workers of
America, which represents several
thousand employees in New Mexico,
contributed $100,000 through its
political action committee in New
Mexico. The American Federation of
Teachers, one of two national
teachers unions that represents New
Mexico educators, gave $50,000.

Gambling interests: $648,392
This is a significant development in
New Mexico campaign finances. Ina
matter of five years, gambling
money has become one of the top
influences in state politics.

The top gambling contributor was
the Downs at Albuquerque, which
donated $100,000.

The Downs has a relationship with
the state because the racing license
is regulated by the state Racing
Commission. The Downs also

operates a casino that is regulated
by the state Gaming Control Board.

The Downs also rents the racetrack
and casino facilities from the New
Mexico State Fair. The state recently
sued the Downs on behalf of the
State Fair for more than $100,000 in
back rent that has not been paid.

Paul Blanchard, the president of the
Downs, was a key player in helping
Richardson raise campaign money.
He donated $10,000 of his own
money. Blanchard's wife, Kandace,
also donated $10,000.

Other major gambling contributors
include Riviera Gaming Management
Inc., a Las Vegas corporation that is
working with partners in New
Mexico, including Ken Newton, to get
a license to open a horse racetrack
and casino in Hobbs. Riviera donated
$50,000 to Richardson's campaign.

The Pueblo of Sandia contributed
$56,148 in cash and in-kind
donations to Richardson. Sandia
operates the state's largest tribal
casino.

Democratic organizations:
$490,751

The Democratic Governors
Association chipped in $427,500 to
help elect Richardson. That amount Oo

House and Congress on issues that
affect states.

Richardson also attracted $51,000
from the New Democrat Network, a
political group that embraces
centrist Democrats.

Richardson also received $12,751 in
cash from the state Democratic
Party, although he contributed
$350,000 from his account to help
the party's coordinated campaign to
elect Democrats.

4. Richardson's congressional
account: $289,315
Richardson transferred all of the
money from the bank account he

previously used for his congressional

campaigns in the state's 3rd
Congressional District in northern
New Mexico.

Richardson had fought in court in
the early 1990s for the right to
transfer money from a federal
campaign account to a state
account, even though the state
constitution bans the practice. The
state Supreme Court ruled that the
constitutional provision violated the
federal constitution.

5. Peters Corporation: $138,376
Gerald Peters, owner of the Peters
Gallery in Santa Fe, is a close friend
of Richardson.

In addition to $102,000 in cash
contributions donated to the
campaign, Peters also flew
Richardson in his private plane
during several campaign swings
around the state. He also provided

food and beverages for an event and

donated art. Those in-kind
contributions amounted to $35,000
in aid.

6. Jerry Perenchio, president of
Univision: $116,667
Perenchio founded Univision, the
Spanish-language TV network that
broadcasts throughout the United

States. He also owns Chartwell
Partners, a Los Angeles investment
company.

Perenchio has actively supported
candidates, mostly in California. He
gave at least $200,000 to California
Gov. Gray Davis during this election
cycle. He also gave money to
national Republican Congressional
Committees and made smaller
donations to Democratic
congressional candidates.

Richardson has known Perenchio
since his days in Congress.

7. Maloof family: $87,417
The high-profile New Mexico family,
known for its support of Democratic
candidates and causes, put its
financial backing behind Richardson.

The Joe G. Maloof Company, the
family's liquor business, pitched in
$30,000. Gavin Maloof donated
$40,000.

Family matriarch Colleen Maloof
used her Albuquerque home and
catered a fund-raising event - to the
tune of $15,917 - on Richardson's
behalf. Former Vice President Al
Gore was the featured guest at the
event.

The Maloofs own the Sacramento
Kings basketball team and the Palms
Casino and Resort in Las Vegas,
Nev.

The Maloofs also donated a $1,500
trip to its Las Vegas resort as an
auction item that Richardson used
during a fund-raising event.

8. BGK Equities III LLC: $50,000
The Santa Fe real estate company is
one of the largest commercial firms
in the state.

Among its clients are state agencies,
which lease office space from BGK.

dob/122986 and on the 200 block
of Bahama Lane, charging them both with possession of marijuana under
grams and possession of drug paraphernalia under the following
circumstances:

On this date at approximately 2340 hours, I observed a four door
white Mitsubishi, Florida tag Cl04VY, parked in a safety zone along a
curve in the roadway, across from 760 N. Ocean Blvd. As I drove up
behind the vehicle, the vehicle left the safety zone which I then
conducted a car stop on the 200 block of Bahama Lane. Upon

approaching the auto, I observed five occupants inside the car,
several having bloodshot eyes. I also detected an odor of marijuana
from inside the auto along with observing the occupants appeared very
nervous. I first spoke with the operator of the vehicle, Benjamin
Bryan and asked him if he had marijuana in his auto. Benjamin Bryan
informed me that he did have marijuana, handing me a quantity of
marijuana rolled in brown paper. I then asked the remainder of the
tely if they had marijuana and a female, identified as
informed me that she did have marijuana, handing me

from her pocketbook a clear plastic bag containing a quantity of
marijuana, a brown paper bag containing a quantity of marijuana and a
glass pipe containing marijuana residue. A search of the vehicle
incident to the lawful arrests, I recovered a glass pipe containing
marijuana from under the front seat. Both individuals were charged
with possession of marijuana under 20 grams and possession of drug
paraphernalia and issued NTA's, returnable to Criminal Court, 3238 Gun
Club Rd., on 9/27/05 at 0800 hours without incident. The marijuana
possessed by Benjamin Bryan tested positive and weighed at 1.3 grams.

The marijuana possessed by ~~ s “" tested positive and 3.0
grams. All recovered items were placed into evidence.

I also conducted an investigation on the remaining three
individuals: David A. Cruz, dob/030987, William L. Tucker, dob/032887
and Paul J. Abrams, dob/052386. Paul Abrams was found to be in
possession of a suspended license, which I confiscated his license and
issued him a criminal citation for such, returnable to the Criminal
Justice Complex, 3228 Gun Club Rd., on 9/27/095 at 1330 hours.

rough times
Current mood: © sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.)
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time.
There's been so much death around me. It's really
overwhelming.

Hey,

Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit!
For all of you who are not aware, I moved to
Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will
and I are getting along. Not like everyone
predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of
that time together will be horrible,...." the complete
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this"
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired.
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool.
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it.
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview
the day he came in with the application, I think that's
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a
lil’ while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS
job and the lady called me back and told me that
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence
that she didn't need to call anyone else back,.....he
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the old
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back
home. ilove you guys. Don't forget about me.

Biker Bitch
Current mood: @) exhausted
Category: Automotive

I am soooo0000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys
For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I
went with him. It was soooo0000000 cool! There was
400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this
guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving

TU CEEE EEOC I donated a football and a
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap.
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to.
Bye!

Current mood: @) crushed
Category: School, College, Greek

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for Jn Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling
different emotions and I have no idea how to deal
with it.

halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up
going to a party. our makeup was awesome. i only
have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have
more. the one i have up is of us after the make-up
had been on for hours,...... it started to peel off in the
pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found
a red pitbull puppy a few days ago. i wrote a bulletin
about her but i forgot to add that she is soooc00
good with children. i have an 18 month old living
with me and she is just soooo nice to him. she loves
to play with him and has not shown one sign of
agression. even with another dog that is bigger than
her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i
want to keep her soooo bad, i just can't tho.

Greetings from Tallahassee
Current mood: © peaceful

I made it! I'm ati love it here. My dorm is so
big and nice, compared to most of the other dorms
on campus. I've been going to class now for three
weeks and I love it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing
quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in
love with [fhe weather, most of the time is
perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is
visiting and I am so excited. I'm goinna show him all
over. We're going to have the best time! Hopefully,
everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this
pace I'll have a descent chance at the dean's list.
OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss
everyone! XOXO -,

Bitching and Moaning
Current mood: ©) exhausted
Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes

So, I am Officially a “college gal." The past two days
have been incredibly stressful. I've been so busy; all
I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm
yesterday but I still have alot of stuff to buy to make
it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is awesome.
There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky
enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal
with and the room is a decent size so I can have
privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement,
however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going
Ot. I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who
knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not used to falling asleep by
myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked
women on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not,

I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely.
Anyway, I finished orientation today. It was sooo00
boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when
registration opens and go on the computer and finish
applying for classes because for some reason that
shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My
INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it
this morning at 3am because I had to register today
and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last
minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME

WEEDI!ITIEPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE etree T CAN'T
WAIT! (Hold On: Let me say that
again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY
WEED! T also want to get a

vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because
apparently there are 'narcs' everywhere. Well, I'm
really excited about starting class and meeting
people. If you've read to this point then I feel bad for
you. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up,...... I
hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry
to those of you I promised to hang out with but
couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch
to all of those who know me. Wish me luck!

guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving
KUTT I donated a football and a
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap.

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for Jpn Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u

awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only
have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy
too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's
going on,..... I miss Will,....1 guess he misses me, but who knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not
used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women
on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I
don't know how I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished
orientation today. It was sooooo boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it
this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted
to do. I'm so last minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME

vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs'
everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If
you've read to this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this
thing up,..... I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me.

I am $00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My
neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was sooooco000000 cool! There was 400
bikes, It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes
all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and
went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to
promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing
there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving

two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to
let everyone know what I was up to. Bye!

How will system judge

We soon will find out whether
big money can buy from the crimi-
nal justice system what everyone
assumes that big money can buy.

The penalty news reports say
parttime Palm Beach resident
Jeffrey Epstein is expected to face
suggests that he will plead guilty
to something more than one felony
count for solicitation of prostitution.
A Palm Beach County grand jury
indicted the Manhattan money
manager on that charge in July
2006. But a guilty plea that does not
recognize the age of the girls whom
police say the billionaire paid for
sex would be a disservice to the
girls, an insult to the investigators
who pressed the case and, lor good
measure, a general outrage.

Palm Beach police have said that
Jeffrey Epstein, 54, paid underage
girls, one as young as 14, to come ta
his 7.200-square-foot waterfront home
for “massage” sessions. Police said
interviews with five alleged victims
and 17 witnesses under oath, phone
messages, a high school transcript
and other items they found in Mr
Epstein's trash and. home show that
he knew how young the girls were.
But after Mr. Epstein’ attorneys told
prosecutors about the girls’ MySpace
pages, which mentionec| marijuana
and alcohol use, State Attorney Barry
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury,
instead of filine charges himself.

Blaming these victims, however,
does not make them any ruore de-
serving of what happened. And Mr.

grand jury, after_an J1-month police

Accused of paying underage girls for sex, superrich money manager Jeffrey Epstein is
finding that living in a dream world is dangerous—even if you can pay for it.

@ By Philip Weiss
e@ Published Dec 10, 2007

Corts!

Jeffrey Epstein is under indictment for sex crimes in Palm Beach, Florida, and I’d expected that when he
came into the office of PR guru Howard Rubenstein, he would be sober and reserved. Quite the
opposite. He was sparkling and ingenuous, apologizing for the half-hour lateness with a charming line—
“I never realized bow many one-way streets and no-right-turns there are in midtown. I finally got out
and walked”—and as we went down the corridor to Rubenstein’s office, he asked, “Have you managed
to talk to many of my friends?” Epstein had been supplying me the phone numbers of important
scientists and financiers and media figures. “Do you understand what an extraordinary group of people

of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein’s rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house;
Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein’s forte was dealing with wealthier
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no
footman; he loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who
could show the rich how to live with their money. “I want people to understand the power, the
responsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. “I
think it’s all done with mirrors,” says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and
lost) when an oil deal didn’t work out.

Next: Epstein's Icarus moment.

The New York Times

Stroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. “Everybody who’s his friend thinks he’s so
darn brilliant because he’s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, | never saw him work. Anybody |
know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.”

Those who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind
goes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from
mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct
answer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of 1Q.”

A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to
make connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is
extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also
to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an
extremely short attention span. Why?— it’s not that he’s bored. He has enough information after fifteen

minutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert’s
statements.”

Epstein has been a munificent supporter of cutting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early
biotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the
late nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference
on the West Coast in his beautiful 727.

“Tt was all a little giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a little food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after
fifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he
had a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual attire. Jeans, no socks,
loafers, a button-down shirt, shirttails out. And he was followed onto the plane by—how shall I say
this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, 18, 19, 20, who
knows? They were model-like. They towered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.
You didn’t know what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very
tall girls?”

Soon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 71st Street. He understood that there was a
purpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the
media mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to show up in the press. In 2002, he flew
Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being
written about. In 2003, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was
involved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his
office at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His
literal office is where Bennett Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at
all. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the
trading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throwback, a
bunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and
a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s
going on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”

Epstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting attention. One
friend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural
forces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory
of the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief battened onto a rich man because he was not living
in a box like everyone else.

The dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knowing it—in March 2005. That was
when a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,
said that she believed her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The
stepmother had learned about the matter in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an
“involuntary -admitted juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shown up at
the schoo] with $300 in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a
“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a
call from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.
The girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic
Intracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of
who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,
naked but for a towel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he
touched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.

Next: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.

The lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear how police connected gray-haired Jeff with
Jeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw
themselves into an investigation of the modem and palatial house on El Brillo Way.

Palm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for towering ficus privacy hedges on
Mediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the
police did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,
where, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The 14-
year-old was used to set up her 18-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once
and thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $200 a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.
The police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer
parks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,
who said they could make $200 by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her
the younger the better—which she said meant 18 to 20. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re 18.
There might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A
couple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 50 times,
another hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-19-year-old
beauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in
Yugoslavia.

Epstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto
Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of
the sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the
statue of the man with a bow. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an
eye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac
Escalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,
through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York
decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized
a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-
shaped soaps.

Those soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t
hiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and
basic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have
been prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgrown it.
You can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not allowed. It may be allowed if you’re
secretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an
achievement to Jeffrey.”

Some girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who
allegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love
with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were matter-of-
fact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.

But generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein
was the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was
very uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,
and Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They
didn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what

Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they
talked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “powerful” and was
afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in
which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to
model the underwear he’d bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was
so upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship
with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”

Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly
and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom
was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with
sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like
Hugh Hetner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge pom is
men with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,
and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,
Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and
Coeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that
his activities would result in a police investigation.

His claim that he’d given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The
massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily
massages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities
preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue
masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy
endings.

Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.

The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The
law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls
might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein
wouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying
that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered
whatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told
police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could
happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of
roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.

“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he
was talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, “Maybe you should say, ‘] like
young women.’ ”

Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law
professor, provided the police and the state attorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims
gleaned from their MySpace sites—showing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police
complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to
appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say,
“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”

By then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the

Next: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong.

The police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had
had a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the
daughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died
mysteriously off his yacht in 1991. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father
and that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas
says he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,
and the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was
five years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never showed up in all the surveillance,
only her stationery.

Epstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told
police that toward the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to
wash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,

said that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scattered on the floor. 9 pS yo an =

No need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it yn

The U.S. attorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would
be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein
will not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state attorney on the prostitution charge.

Not that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the
air that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endowed him with utter
shamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the
mora] questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the
social contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this matter, he has a
philosophical position.

“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich
get richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this
whole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more
successful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater
the discrepancy actually is.”

There is no better place to observe how Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of
life are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from
Bulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls
came from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,
and pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.
An attractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams
it. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”

Driving home with their $500, Haley said to the 14-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd
be rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest
stories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,
said she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation
with him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm
Beach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.

“In my mind, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, when this is over you’re getting so much money.”

José Lambiet says the case went forward in Palm Beach despite the efforts of the dream team because of
community rage arising from the class issues in the case—Epstein found the girls not from his own
fancy neighborhood but from the struggling suburbs.

He has never shown a glimmer of understanding that a high-school girl could be damaged by a powerful

50-year-old’s demands, or that some of the girls were already emotionally damaged. For someone who
could dream anything, it seems a little small.

Entered By.: OREGERO, LAURA D. 10/06/03

On Sunday 10/5/03 at approximately 0824 hours, I
was dispatched to a burglary at 358 El Brillo Way. Upon
arrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white
male, dob/012053. Epstein advised he and his personal
assistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/052579, arrived in
the residence on Friday evening, 10/3/03. Epstein advised
that on Saturday evening 10/4/03, he left his briefcase at his
desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein
said when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately
$5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100
bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase.
Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday,
10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had
been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein
believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase.
Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was
sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black
Glock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind
his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been
taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was
in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day

was accounted for. Possible footage of the incident may
exist. I next met with Kellen who advised she went to bed at
approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see
anything unusual through the night or on the morning of
10/5/03. Cotxrin, the resident chef advised that he went to

and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike
stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately
8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm
same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said
he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on
10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated
that she checked the exterior of the residence at
approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties.
Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything
appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at
approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30
on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie
Friedman have been employed as the house managers since
9/24/03. Prior to them, the live on site house managers were
Patrick and Evelyn, Epstein was unsure of the last name.
Patrick Evelyn were employed at 358 El Brillo approximately
months. Prior to the house manager was John Alessi who
was employee at 358 El Brillo approximately 10 years.
Epstein signed an affidavit of prosecution, it is attached to
this report. Crime Scene manager Parkinson responded and
processed the scene. Det. Melnichok also responded. See
Det. Melnichok's report for further information. Officer Nault

At 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home
by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a
burglary had been reported at 358 El Brillo. I responded to the
scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up
the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process
the crime scene.

I went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m.
Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west
end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with
the front of the house facing north. ‘The house is basically a two
story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim
is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with
metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch

pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops

of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals

approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358.

The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way
leading to a three car garage.

The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage
two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on
them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was
degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been
touched or tampered with.

On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer

room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass
windows present. The eastern most and western most are

identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of
flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was
found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism

in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to

have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a
xubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central
window.

Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on

the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a
supplement to that effect that will follow.

358 £1 Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video
footage of the suspect burglar.

mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein

Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at

At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed
several video cameras on the outside of the building and
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the
building.

At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager
Greg Parkingon that he had located fingerprints for the
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach
identification card application.

At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and
spoke with the manager of the condominium who
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement.
Dement gave me his direct business number
561-833-8170, and his home phone number
§61-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes.

Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on

Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he
advised that he would check and call me back in the
morning.

On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into
the police department and informed me that earlier today he met
with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm
Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph
obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi
admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi
told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that
Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the

gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having
problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun
because he was contemplating suicide.

Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the
stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi
to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of
Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that
Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would
make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to
be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute
Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said
he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi
said he does not have it.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein

and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of

the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag
U72UGL.

On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time.
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had
denied taking the Glock hand gun.

In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun.

On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with
mailing the original back to me for my case file.

At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo.

Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a Full recovery of the U.S.
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.

young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn

report these incidents because he was not sure the money
was accounted for. Possible footage of the incident may
exist. I next met with Kellen who advised she went to bed at
approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see
anything unusual through the night or on the morning of
10/5/03. Cotrin, the resident chef advised that he went to
bed at approximately 1030 pm on 10/4/03 and began work at
approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03. Cotrin stated that he did
not see or hear anything unusual from the staff residence
locate don the east side of the property. I next spoke to Mike
and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike
stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately
8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm
same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said
he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on
10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated
that she checked the exterior of the residence at
approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties.
Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything
appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at
approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30
on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie
Friedman have been employed as the house managers since

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way
reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53.

Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the
amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident
and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was ina
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it.
Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar
bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up
and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there
were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope
and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the
suspect.

Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer
monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and
then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein

told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was

but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size
and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the

video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman

did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who

was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt,

and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's
information which was Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, Living at

1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida.

I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the
surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to
have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working
knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who
had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday.

Epstein told me he would call when he had more information.

Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry
into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side
cf the house but not the west side of house because he had
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house.

It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the

same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee

Bivd. to obtain the information.

Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and
collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.

Entered By.: GREENE, LINDA C.

On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video
footage of the suspect burglar.

Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk

drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a
property receipt.

At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed
several video cameras on the outside of the building and
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the
building.

At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach
identification card application.

At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and
spoke with the manager of the condominium who
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement.
Dement gave me his direct business number

561-833-8170, and his home phone number _

561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes.

Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on

Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he
advised that he would check and call me back in the
morning.

he lives at 358 El Brillo. Juan said he worked for Mr.
Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as
the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with
Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked
Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the
past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did
take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained
approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed
about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous
medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he
became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr.
Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr.
Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr.
Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver
revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan
did not know the exact date, but he said it was
approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a
Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's
house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the
gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it
in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the
house through an unlocked sliding glass door located
near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office
and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched
the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then
went into Epstein's briefcase and removed
approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a
white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he
immediately left the house.

Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at
approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358
El Brillo in order to steal money once again from

_.. Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white
Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan
entered the house through the sliding glass door and
entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase
and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a
white envelope. Juan said he left through the same
glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he
wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a
short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did
not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the
money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers.

I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was
not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly
basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan
omce again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house.

Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03,

and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the
money that was taken.

rough times
Current mood: € sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.)
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been
Snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time.
There's been so much death around me. It's really
overwhelming.

predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of
that time together will be horrible,.,.." the complete
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the
second day that we were here but all I did was get
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this”
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired.
Yesterday is when I took them, I ended up getting a
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool.
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it.
The boss guy caijled him back to set up an interview
the day he came in with the application, I think that's
a good sign. It starts at4¢pm. He's at the mall right
now. I got to call him and ask him_how it went ina
lil' while. It's only 3:45 right now.(h, it was so
funny - 1 used him as one of my references for my VS
job and the lady called me back and told me that
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence
that she didn't need to call anyone else back,..... he
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the o
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8fNo
( complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

Fronstin had telephoned her reference this case. Although nothing was
discussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate

about massages.

I also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss reference the previous employees,
Juan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through
a subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on
Monday November 21, 2005 at 12:00 p.m.

On November 21, 2005, I met with ASA Weiss, Atty. Donnie Murrell and
Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney Office. ASA Weiss had
requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the
Alessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her attorney,
Donnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight
years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had
never had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her
husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing
house cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The
girls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not know any
of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that
when Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis
during his stay in Palm Beach.

I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie
Murrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with
Mr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then
moved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.
Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance
person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s
arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing
with his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with

Epstein directly.

I asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.
Alessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and
younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be
sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would
occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled
that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a
massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator anda
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.
\dditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made
after the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the

short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did

“met wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the

money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers.

I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was
not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly
basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan
once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house.

Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03,

and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the
money that was taken.

Entered By.: GREENE, LINDA C. Li/its fos

On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's

vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag
U72UGL.

on 10/13/03, T was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time.
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had
denied taking the Glock hand gun.

In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun.

On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with
mailing the original back to me for my case file.

{ae 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo.

Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a full recovery of the U.S.
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.

awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only
have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy
too, I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's
going on,..... I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not
used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women
on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I
don't know how I'm going to adjust, I’m so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished
orientation today. It was sooooo boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it
this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted
to do. I'm so last minute on everything£L CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME

everywhere,jWell, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If
you've read to this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this
thing up,...... I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me.

Wish me luck!

rough times
Current mood: & sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.)
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already
looked 'not so good’ so I decided not to try and see
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time.
There's been so much death around me. It's really
overwhelming.

predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of
that time together will be horrible,,..." the complete
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the
second day that we were here but all I did was get
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this"
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired.
Yesterday is when I took them, I ended up getting a
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool.
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it.
The boss guy cailed him back to set up an interview
the day he came in with the application, I think that's
a good sign. It starts at4pm. He's at the mall right
now. I got to call him and ask him_how it went in a
lil’ while. It's only 3:45 right now.(Oh, it was so
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS
job and the lady called me back and told me that
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence
that she didn't need to call anyone else back,.....he
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the o
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str83 No
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply
of mary j and have to conserve. J] miss everyone back
home. ilove you guys. Don't forget about me.

lL _DETECTFVE: The next time you went, or as you continued to go, did it escalate
more?
Lo Uh huh. I actually, I don’t remember how long it took for me to
start working for him regularly from the first time I went there, um.
But, I started working every day. Every single day he was in the
(4 country I would be there. Um, I’m, I’m sorry, I like — can you give
me a second.
10’ DETECTIVE: Sure, absolutely.
an Yeah. I started working there every single day, and um, I told him
that I wouldn’t let him put anything inside of me, that was my rule.
Nothing inside of me, no fingers, no, no nothing, absolutely
nothing inside of me. He increased my pay to three or four
hundred dollars as long as he could touch me. Um, I still never, I,
I swear I never touched him, the whole entire time I never ever
touched him. Um, but he, he
20. DETECTIVE: //How many times would you say you went?
> i Hundreds. Hundreds, I was — he used to tell me I was his favorite.
He bought me a car. He bought me
25° DETECTIVE: //This Jeep that you’re driving?
P| No. I had a brand new Dodge Neon. I got plane, I got a plane
ticket to New York, I got spending money whenever I wanted.
Like, I was in there deep. I was — he asked my parents to
emancipate me so I could live with him. Or he didn’t ask my
parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I’m sorry. He act — he
actually wanted me to come live with him.
34. DETECTIVE: As like a girlfriend?
S| Sex slave, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Um, but it
escalated — he, he just increased my pay, as long as he could touch
me. I wouldn’t let him put anything inside of me. And then one
day he just did, one day he just put his hand like his fingers. And
um,
DETECTIVE: How long would you say, from the very first time you went,
ao SS Months. Honestly, I never kept track, like of, of what happened
when. | just can tell you in which order things progressed.

DETECTIVE: Okay.
P| But not specifically, oh, three months later he did this, three
months later like, I can’t do that.
DETECTIVE: Okay. When he purchased the car, how far were you, um.
f How old was I?
DETECTIVE: Yeah.
P| That what you mean? He bought the car in, [sigh] I gotta recall, I
haven’t thought about this in forever. Um. I can I can give you
like four, four months that it possibly was during, but I can’t
specifically remember if it was before or after the New Year. Um,
November, December, January February, that just passed.
18... DETECTIVE: Of 2004?

Wait a second.

ae)

DETECTIVE: So were you a senior in high school when you had the car?

Yeah, it was recently.

NN
nA

DETECTIVE: Okay.


P| It was, it was like, towards the middle and end of my school year.
But I remember that for the last like six or eight weeks of high

school, I didn’t have a car cause | gave it back to him. Because he,
he asked me to have sex with him and like, like suck him and stuff
[giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not. I was like, [ll let
you touch me but I’m not gonna do that.


a This is 2005, right?


r Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the
New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a
year before they were supposed to come out. So if I got it, I

obviously didn’t get a 2006 cause that’s this year. I got a 2005

4] Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. That car was

awesome [giggles].


44. DETECTIVE: Okay. And that’s the car that you used to drive to and from,


S| To and from school, just out with my friends.

me and stuff, and I stopped working but then I lied to, I lied to Will
a couple times and I worked, but then Will found out. And that’s
when, like he, he broke up with me, and then that once he broke up
with me that was what I needed to really snap me into reality and

“NEw Yor«K. SOCIAL Diary

Abe autiful warm day 1 in New York

Under a canopy of Cherry Blossoms in + Central Park. L: 45 PM. Bhole: 3H.

Some people were beginning to complain about the heat. A good
sign. Beauty abounds.

| went to an early dinner over at Swifty’s with some old friends in from
out of town. The place was jammed on this early Monday night in New
York.

At the table by the open windows was Lee Radziwill with friends. At
another table, Jim Kaufman was dining with Laura Codman, in from
Texas on her way to London. Laura is directly descended from Ogden
Codman, the gran-pappy of 20th century interior design. Ogden
Codman is now the god of interior design. Talk about influence, talk
about power in New York! Except he’s dead. Daid. And I'll bet at least
50% of the design community (sorry, but I'll bet I’m right) doesn’t have a
clue as to WHO Ogden Codman is/was. Or even his collaborator Edith
Wharton. That's okay, that’s show biz.

Re: Jane Doe v. Epstein

Dear Jack:

This letter is written due to the deep and serious concern about the ethics of your co-counsel.
Because your co-counsel refused to provide copies of the documents and photographs used in his
direct examination of yesterday to the State Attorney or me, which is the professional and
customary thing to do, and the fact that he refused to even allow the court reporter to mark the
documents as exhibits I am quite fearful we may never see the exhibits again.

Dear Ms. Belolavek:

Po was apparently served with the attached subpoena sometime last week.
It is a Subpoena for Deposition ques who is not presently residing with ___<l. I
attempted to contact you today to discuss this matter, unsuccessfully. The deposition is
scheduled for February 6 at 9:30 a.m. It is my understanding that __ is not aware of this
subpoena and will not be appearing for the deposition. In addition, I do not know that service of
the subpoena on Ps is sufficient for because she does not reside with him.

Mr. Epstein’s counsel Jack Goldberger is aware that I represent a. a
civil claim filed on behalf of his daughter ~ “_ [| however, he did not send me a copy of the
notice or subpoena for deposition, nor did he contact me to coordinate same. In the future, I
would appreciate if your office and Mr. Goldberger’s office would keep me in the loop on the
scheduling of the depositions for the J. ‘amily.

Thank you for your assistance in this regard.

Very truly yours,

Jeffrey Herman

Defendant.

RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his attorney and
files his response to the Motion For Protective Order filed by counsel for State’s witness

Jane Doe No. 1.

1. In summary fashion, counsel for Jane Doe No. 1 complains that serving a
witness for deposition by the use of a process server and the service of the witness’
parents for the deposition to ensure service, amounts to “continuous and systematic

harassment”. '
2. The Motion For Protective Order was filed by one of the attorneys purporting to

represent Jane Doe No. 1 in a separate civil proceeding.” While disagreeing with the

' Undersigned counsel for the Defendant responds only to the issues in the Motion for
Protective Order concerning service of a subpoena for deposition and the date for that deposition.
Defendant and undersigned counsel have no knowledge of any agent of the Defendant going to
the witness’ place of employment representing “himself as an attorney who needed to contract
(sp) her” as alleged “on information and belief” in paragraph 8 of the Motion for Protective

Order.

* The Motion for Protective Order was filed by attorney Theodore Leopold. While he
purports to represent Jane Doe No.1, attorney Jeffrey Herman also claims to represent the
interests of Jane Doe No. 1. In that separate civil proceeding, the two law firms are presently
litigating who represents the interests of Jane Doe No. 1.

assertion in the Motion For Protective Order that Mr. Leopold and the undersigned agreed
that Mr. Leopold would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe No. 1, and that the
undersigned had agreed not to take the disposition on February 6, 2008, the matter has
been rendered moot.

3. Prior to filing of a Motion For Protective Order, Mr. Leopold and the undersigned
conferred and agreed in writing with the consent of the State Attorney’s Office to the taking
of Jane Doe No.1's deposition on February 20, 2008. The parties have also agreed that
Mr. Leopold will accept service for Jane Doe’s No.1's appearance on that date eliminating
the need to use a process server to serve Jane Doe No.1. See Exhibit “A” attached. (Jane
Doe No. 1's real name has been redacted from the exhibit.)

WHEREFORE, given the fact that the parties have agreed to a procedure for the
taking of Jane Doe’s No.1's deposition, it is respectfully requested that this Court deny
Jane Doe No.1's Motion for Protective Order as moot.

Defendant.

RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his attorney and
files his response to the Motion For Protective Order filed by counsel for State’s witness
Jane Doe No. 1.

1. In summary fashion, counsel for Jane Doe No. 1 complains that serving a
witness for deposition by the use of a process server and the service of the witness’
parents for the deposition to ensure service, amounts to “continuous and systematic
harassment”. '

2. The Motion For Protective Order was filed by one of the attorneys purporting to

represent Jane Doe No. 1 in a separate civil proceeding.” While disagreeing with the

' Undersigned counsel for the Defendant responds only to the issues in the Motion for
Protective Order concerning service of a subpoena for deposition and the date for that deposition.
Defendant and undersigned counsel have no knowledge of any agent of the Defendant going to
the witness’ place of employment representing “himself as an attorney who needed to contract
(sp) her” as alleged “on information and belief” in paragraph 8 of the Motion for Protective
Order.

The Motion for Protective Order was filed by attorney Theodore Leopold. While he
purports to represent Jane Doe No.1, attorney Jeffrey Herman also claims to represent the

interests of Jane Doe No. 1. In that separate civil proceeding, the two law firms are presently
litigating who represents the interests of Jane Doe No. 1.

Plaintiff,
vs.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN
Defendant.

MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

Jane Doe No. | (“Jane Doe”), by and through her mother and natural guardian, hereby

files this Motion for Protective Order. As grounds for said motion, Jane Doe states as follows:

I. On July 19, 2006 the State of Florida filed a criminal Indictment against Jeffrey
Epstein (“Epstein”).

2. Jane Doe, a victim of Epstein’s actions, recently filed a civil lawsuit against
Epstein. The complaint alleges among other things that Epstein has a sexual preference and
obsession for underage minor girls. That he engaged in a scheme in which he gained access to
minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Jane Doe was
one of Epstein’s victims. She was lured into Epstein’s Palm Beach home under false pretenses
and was sexually assaulted by Epstein. As a result, Jane Doe suffered injuries, including

intentional infliction of emotional distress damages.

----------------------------------------
3. After the filing of the civil lawsuit and during the week of January 25, 2008,
Epstein’s criminal attorney, Jack Goldberger, Esq., contacted the undersigned to advise that he
wished to take the deposition, in the criminal matter, of Jane Doe on February 6, 2008. The
undersigned informed Mr. Goldberger that he would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, but
was not available on February 6, 2008. Counsel agreed to use best efforts to schedule the
deposition at a mutually convenient date and time.

4. Despite these assurances and understanding, on Friday evening, February 1, 2008,
Epstein’s process server served Jane Doe at her place of work for a deposition scheduled to take
place on February 6, 2008. ' See Subpeona attached as Exhibit “A” (Jane Doe’s real name has
been redacted from the exhibit).

a The undersigned was forced to call Mr. Goldberger on Friday evening and remind
him of our earlier conversation and agreement and to insist that the deposition be re-noticed.’

6. After the conversation of Friday evening and with the expressed assurances that
the undersigned would accept service for Jane Doe, two days later on Monday morning February
4, 2008, Mr. Goldberger had a process server serve Jane Doe’s mother who resides out of state in

Po See Subpoena attached as Exhibit “B” (Jane Doe’s mother’s name has been
redacted from the exhibit).

i. The service of process on Jane Doe’s mother was defective as an Out of State
Commissioner was never appointed and no order was issued by this court authorizing such
service. Additionally, Mr. Goldberger had been told not once, but twice that the undersign would

accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, yet despite this Epstein and/or his attorney has insisted on

' Mr. Goldberger unilaterally set Jane Doe’s deposition for February 6, 2008 despite knowing that the undersigned
was not available on that date.
? Mr. Goldberger has now agreed to postpone the deposition.

having the victim’s privacy repeatedly intruded upon by process servers seeking her out at her
employment and then again, intruding upon her mother.

8. Additionally, during this same time period yet another adult male came to Jane
Does’ employment and represented himself as an “attorney” who needed to contract her. Upon
information and belief that person was also an agent of Mr. Epstein’s.

9. It can only be concluded that Epstein and/or his counsel are purposefully
attempting to harass Jane Doe and her mother. These actions are nothing more than a continuous
insult to injury upon a young girl who has already been emotionally scarred for life.

WHEREFORE, Jane Doe, by and through Jane Doe’s mother and natural guardian,
hereby move the Court for a Protective Order prohibiting Jeffrey Epstein and/or his counsel from

continuous and systematic harassment.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was furnished by

Facsimile and U. S. Mail, postage prepaid, this 4 day of February 2008 to all counsel on the

attached service list.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN,

Defendant
/

MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

COMES NOW, Witness Y. Doe,’ by and through undersigned counsel,
respectfully moves for a protective order pursuant to Florida Rule Criminal Procedure
3.220(1)(1), requiring that the deposition of Y. Doe be taken in this matter in conjunction
with and at the same time with the deposition of Y. Doe in the civil case captioned Jane
Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida. As grounds therefore, Witness Y. Doe
states as follows:

‘ Y. Doe has been subpoenaed for deposition in this case by the Defendant
Jeffrey Epstein. The subpoena schedules the deposition for April 2, 2008.

es Y. Doe is a victim in this matter who alleges that she was sexually
assaulted by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein when she was 16 years old. Y. Doe has brought a

civil case against Defendant Epstein captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case

' The witness is named here anonymously as “Y. Doe” because of the sensitive
allegations of sex abuse upon a minor involved in this case.

no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.

3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and
issues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.

4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and
necessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by
Defendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and
traumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.

5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this
case if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same
time.

6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220(1)(1) provides that the Court
may issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment,
unnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the
deposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(h)(1) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s
circumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be
deposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued
on good cause shown.”

Defendant Epstein would be harassment. A protective order under rule 3.220(1)(1) would
prevent this harassment.
8. Counsel for Witness Y. Doe has contacted both the attorneys for the State
and for Defendant Epstein regarding this request, and neither has responded.
WHEREFORE, Witness Y. Doe respectfully requests a protective order requiring
that the deposition in the criminal case and the civil case captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v.
Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida, be taken at the same time, and for such further relief as
this Court deems just and proper.

Re: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2006CF009454AKX
Dear Ms. Belohlavek:

We have left a number of messages with you to coordinate depositions of our clients in
this case, without response. With regard to the depositions of our clients, it is necessary and
appropriate for the entry of a court order which would require that one deposition be taken of
each of our clients for use in both the criminal case and the civil case. A single deposition is
warranted given that the facts of the sexual assault are common to both the civil and criminal
cases, and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is the same in both cases. A single deposition is in the
best interests of the emotional well being of the victim. In another case we were involved in
where both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Attorney’s office filed a
motion for protective order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(1)(1) asking that
the depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time.

We would like to coordinate and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue
conceming the depositions of our clients. The deposition of is presently
scheduled for Wednesday, April 2, 2008. Please let us know how you would like to proceed in
this important matter as soon as possible.

Very truly yours,

Stuart S. Mermelstein

as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Food Stamps, Medicaid,
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP), or Federal Public Housing/Section 8. If you are at or below 125% of the
poverty level, but not currently receiving benefits from one of the listed programs,

RE: Freedom of Information Request
Jeffrey Epstein Case

Case Number 2005CF009454A

Dear Ms. Belohlavek:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Freedom of Information that was sent on
August 14, 2006 to the Public Information Department of the State Attorney’s Office and
pending there ever since.

J understand that at the moment the file cannot be released because it is still an
“active investigation”, yet all notices related to hearings on this case, or the dates,
time and place of the hearings for this case are public record, even if the decision to
postpone, cancel or change is done “orally” I was informed that the file in your office has
no record of this request to change the date of the scheduled plea conference of January
4,2008. The Freedom of Information Act was created to ensure transparency from our
government officials and prevent sub rosa dealings.

I respectfully request that I be informed of the the hearing dates related to this
case. If the hearing date is changed “orally” I respectfully request pursuant to this FOIA
that I still be contacted. It is imperative to ensure the trust that we have in your office
that hearings are public and that the public be given due notice of them, particularly when
a citizen pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act makes such a request.

Thank you.

RE: Mr. Epstein
FROM: Aileen Josephs, Esq,

Mr. Lewis:

Women in our County have been watching this case with great concern. I
strongly suggest you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel that your client has been
defamed, as you mentioned in the February 7, 2008 Palm Beach Post article, you can file
a libel suit- of course, the truth is an absolute defense to libel and please keep in mind
that not knowing the age of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime
committed against a child.

conducted a car stop on the 200 block of Bahama Lane. Upon

rough times
Current mood: @ sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.)
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already
looked ‘not so good' so I decided not to try and see
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time.
There's been so much death around me. It's really
overwhelming.

second day that we were here but all I did was get
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this”
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired.
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool.
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it.
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview
the day he came in with the application, I think that's
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a
lil’ while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS
job and the lady called me back and told me that
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence
that she didn't need to call anyone else back,.....he
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the old
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back
home. ilove you guys. Don't forget about me.

Biker Bitch
Current mood: @) exhausted
Category: Automotive

I am sooooo000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys
For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I
went with him. It was sooooo000000 cool! There was
400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this
guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving
HHT T donated a football and a
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap.
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to.
Bye!

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for jn Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling
different emotions and I have no idea how to deal
with it.

have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have
more. the one i have up is of us after the make-up
had been on for hours,...... it started to peel off in the
pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found
a red pitbull puppy a few days ago. i wrote a bulletin
about her but i forgot to add that she is sooooo0o
good with children. i have an 18 month old living
with me and she is just soooo nice to him. she loves
to play with him and has not shown one sign of
agression. even with another dog that is bigger than
her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i
want to keep her soooo bad, i just can't tho.

Greetings from Tallahassee
Current mood: ©) peaceful

I made it! I'm afi love it here. My dorm is so
big and nice, compared to most of the other dorms
on campus. I've been going to class now for three
weeks and I love it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing
quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in
love with jhe weather, most of the time is
perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is
visiting and I am so excited. I'm goinna show him all
over. We're going to have the best time! Hopefully,
everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this
pace I'll have a descent chance at the dean's list.
OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss
everyone! XOXO -,;

Bitching and Moaning
Current mood: @) exhausted
Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes

So, I am officially a "college gal." The past two days
have been incredibly stressful. I've been so busy; all
I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm
yesterday but I still have alot of stuff to buy to make
it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is awesome.
There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky
enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal
with and the room is a decent size so I can have
privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement,
however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going
On,..... I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who
knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not used to falling asleep by
myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked
women on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not,

but atleast it feels like it right now. I don't know how
I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely.
Anyway, I finished orientation today. It was sooo00
boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when
registration opens and go on the computer and finish
applying for classes because for some reason that
shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My
INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it
this morning at 3am because I had to register today
and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last
minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME

WEEDI!ITIIEECEETEEEEEEEEEE EET CAN'T.

again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY
WEED!H!HTIIIIEIITIEHEEEE! I also want to geta

vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because
apparently there are 'narcs' everywhere. Well, I'm
really excited about starting class and meeting
people. If you've read to this point then I feel bad for
you. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up,...... I
hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry
to those of you I promised to hang out with but
couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch
to all of those who know me. Wish me luck!

guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving

Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap.

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for bn Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it’s making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling
different emotions and I have no idea how to deal

Greetings from Tallahassee
Current mood: © peaceful

I made it! I'm atl love it here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of
the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love
it. AS a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with rhe weather,
most of the time is perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over. We're going to have the best time!
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a
descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss
everyone! XOXO -""

ip tpyeethomatgs awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only

have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy
too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's
Blog Archive going on,..... I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not
[ Older Newer J used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women
= oG me eS on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I
ll don't know how I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished
orientation today. It was sooocoo boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it
this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted
to do. I'm so last minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME

vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs'
everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If
you've read to this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this
thing up,...... I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me.
Wish me luck!

I am $00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My
neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was soooo0000000 cool! There was 400
bikes, It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes
all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and
went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to
promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing
there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving

two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to
let everyone know what I was upto. Bye!

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for pn Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room
soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not
having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem
like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through
this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20

days ago. i wrote a bulletin about her but i forgot to add that she is sooo00o0 good

Ricci-Leopold “Consumer Justice Attorneys”
2925 PGA Boulevard, # 200

Palm Beach Gardens, Florida 33410

Dear Mr. Leopold:

Yesterday’s fax from you is more of the same misrepresentation of the record and self-
serving grandstanding that you engaged in throughout Wednesday’s deposition. Anyone
who reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to
object on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking
objections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.
BREE ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you
filed against Mr. Epstein for $50,000,000.00 [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. CIv. P.
11. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your
availability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation
plans.

Finally, your letter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. ‘The
deposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of
herself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —
were numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well know that we provided the court
reporter with color copies, which will be attached to the deposition transcript. You also
know that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the
deposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs
when you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed
last week after she was already under subpoena.

I hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.

Very truly y.

Michae

Probable Cause Affidavit

Palm Beach Police Department
Agency ORI# FLO 500600

Police Case#: 05-368
Defendant: Jeffrey Epstein
Race/Sex: White Male
DOB: 01-20-1953
Charges: Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor (2) counts
Lewd and Lascivious Molestation

On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as “The Victim”, and her family
reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. The victim
reported that a subject known to her as “Jeff” had touched her vagina area with a vibrator/massager while within
his residence.

During a sworn taped interview, the victim admitted to knowing that W/F, Haley Robson worked for a wealthy
man and possibly did sexual favors for him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to
make money. The victim identified Robson’s boss as a white male named "Jeff who lived in Palm Beach (Later
positively identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up). During the beginning of February 2005, the
victim explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Jeff's house. The victim stated
Robson said that she would pick her up at the victims house on Sunday. The victim was not sure of the exact
dates but knew it was a Sunday. According to the victim, Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified
as BM icked her up at her father’s house. The victim told her father that they were going shopping. It was
later confirmed by the victim’s father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to

the victim’s father, Robson drove a pick up truck. Robson drove the victim to Palm Beach. Sometime on the
way there, a conversation occurred between Robson and the victim whereas Robson reportedly told the victim
that if Jeff asked her (the victim) age, she should say she was eighteen. The victim recalled that Jeff's house was
on a dead end street. The victim described Jeff's house as a two story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade
parked in the driveway. The girls walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room.
In fact, the victim recalled a male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to
see Jeff. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. The victim stated the man told them that
Jeff was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them
something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly after, Jeff and a woman, described as white with blond hair
entered the kitchen.

The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida

The victim believed the woman was Jeff's assistant. The victim added that the woman did not seem friendly and
kept her responses short and direct. Jeff introduced himself to the victim. The victim described Jeff as being
approximately forty-five years old, a long face, and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair.

Robson and Jeff left the kitchen leaving the victim alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They
all spoke briefly in the kitchen. The victim stated the woman instructed her to follow her upstairs, which she did.
The victim recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room. Upon entering the room there
was a large bathroom to the right. The victim recalled a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door
on each side of the sofa. The victim recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as
several photographs of naked women ona shelf. According to the victim, the woman led her to a room that had
a massage table init. The woman started to fix up the room, putting the covers on the table and taking lotions
out. She then told the victim that Jeff would be up in a second.

The woman left the room, and soon after, Jeff walked in wearing only a towel and told the victim to take off her
clothes. The victim stated he was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. The victim said she did not
know what to do as she was the only one there in the room. The victim took off her shirt leaving her bra on.

Jeff, had removed his towel and told the victim to take off everything . The victim stated Jeff was nude when
he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. The victim stated she removed her
pants leaving her thong panties on. Jeff then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for
her to use. As the victim began to give Jeff the massage, he told her to get on his back. The victim stated she
straddled herself on Jeff's back. The victim stated her exposed buttocks were touching Jeffs bare buttocks.

The victim said Jeff was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage, telling her to go clockwise or
counter clockwise. Jeff then turned over and instructed the victim, to massage his chest. The victim resumed
massaging his chest area. The victim was now standing on the ground. Jeff turned to his side, started to rub his
penis in an up and down motion. The victim stated Jeff held on to the small of her back as she massaged his
chest and shoulder area. Jeff pulled out a purple vibrator and began to massage her vaginal area. The victim
stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. The victim recalled Jeff ejaculating
because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Jeff then left the room and the victim got
dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. The victim admitted to getting paid three
hundred dollars in cash from Jeff. Before they left, Jeff asked the victim to leave her phone number. As they
were leaving the house, Robson told the victim she received only two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.

Probable Cause Affidavit

Palm Beach Police Department
Agency ORI# FLO 500600

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the
driveway. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were
investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would
accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the
interview she would be returned home.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I
explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to
leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson
stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked how she became in contact with
Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the
Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the
driveway. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were
investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would
accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the
interview she would be returned home.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I
explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to
leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson
stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked how she became in contact with
Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the
Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she
would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to

meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked her up and she was taken to Epstein’s
house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also
introduced to a white female known to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as
Jeff Epstein’s bedroom . Sara arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out
the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sara, then left the room and informed her Jeff would be
in, ina minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the
massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him.
During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how did he tried to
touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator
which is large and white in color. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched.
Robson stated she performed the massage naked.

While in the home, I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls
previously mentioned. The stair way which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area is lined
with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females were obtained
as they appeared to be photographs of the girls that had been at the house to provide massages. Various phone
message books were also taken in which his assistant had left messages for Epstein as to which girls were coming
to provide massages.

During the course of the investigation, It was determined that Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant made the
arrangements to have girls come and “work” for Epstein. Kellen was aware of various ages of girls as she had
maintained contact with the girls that had been previously at the house. Additionally, there were various phone
messages left for Epstein by Kellen in which the message had made references such as “the girls would have to
come after they are released from school”.

Based on the facts, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen for Principal in the 1* degree for
Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor 2 counts a second degree felony in direct violation of Florida State Statues
794.05(1) as she orchestrated the arrangement with Epstein and the masseuses in which Epstein had vaginal
intercourse with!” ~* and MMMM it should be noted that both girls were minors when this occurred. There is
sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with Principal in the 1“ degree for Lewd and Lascivious
Molestation (The Victim), a second degree felony in direct violation of Florida State Statues 800.04 (5) as Sarah
Kellen orchestrated the initial contact with the victim who was only 14 years of age when Epstein performed the
molestation with the vibrator on her vagina area.

©. Before your wife came.

A. I started full-time with him on January 1,
1991, and we both left December 31, 2002. So I worked
elleven years: exactly. Prior to that, prier fo working
full-time for him, I worked part-time for him, on-and-off
basis.

ae What were your responsibilities?

A. In the full-time basis, I started as a
houseman, and I became a major domo and butler and
everything else, driver, and did everything. We both did
all the chores in the house, but I was in charge of the

house. I was above my wife and above the cleaning crew,

the gardners, pool people. So I was house manager, major
domo.

You would have been the go-to guy for the
house?

Yes. And the one who would get the blame.

We are talking about Jeffrey Epstein?

Of course.

Do you remember the address of the house?
558 EL Brille,

Was it in the beginning of the street --

At the end of the street, on the left-hand

We're talking about the same house.

oO. During the time that he was here, you

prepared the house, did all the chores.
Did you do any of the cleaning?

A. Sometimes. Many times. I did -- last two
or three years the work was so much that we have to
hire -- we hire a clean-up crew that they came twice a
week or once a week, then it was twice a week. Depends
upon his schedule, because he did not allow anybody at
the house except us when he was in town. So when he was
in town, it was just us doing the cleaning and the
cooking, the driving, shopping, everything else.

oF Did you stay on property in the guest

A. Yes and no. We had an apartment right
across the bridge. We had an apartment in Tower 1515 on
Flagler, and we had an apartment at the house.

Q. Why would you stay at the house, then?

A. We stay at the house mostly when he was
there. When he was not in town, we went home. We went
to our apartment. When he was there, it was -- the job
was Just too much to go home 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock and
come back 5 o'clock in the morning. We would just stay
and sleep and get up and work.

O.. When he was in town, did he receive a lot

of guests at the house?

stay there, he also have a chef, a gourmet chef that he
would Eravel with ham. That"™s it.

OQ. Do you remember the chef's name?

A. There were quite a few. The last one I
know is Adam Perry. P-E-R-R-Y, I think. And he was from
New York.

And there was another French chef, Didier
(phonetic); I don't know his last name.

And there was another English chef. But
they went quickly.

OQ. They would come and go, come and go.

What about the assistant that was his

personal assistant that would fly with him?

De ves.

QO. How many massages would he have in a day?

A. Sometimes one, sometimes two, three.

0. Was it the same girl that would come back

during eleven years, I probably saw a hundred, two
hundred different massage therapists.

Q. Did they seem young to you?

A. No, Sir. Mostly no... We Saw one oF two
young ones in the last year. Before that, it was all
adults.

OQ. During your last year when you were working

it was in the balcony of his quarters. His room has a
wraparound balcony facing the pool. So the massages were
in the balcony outside in the sun, or inside in his
bathroom or her bathroom.

QO. Would you set up the room for the massages?

A. Many times. Yes, he will tell me, Set up
the room inside my bathroom or in the bedroom or in
Elaine's bathroom, or outside on the balcony. And I
would go and set up or my wife would go and set up the
table.

We had a table in every room of the house,
the massage tables, for the different guests. Because
not only he got massages, all the other guests got
massages too. So we have a table -- massage table in
basically every room, guest room.

Or The girls that would come over to do

massages, they would massage him first or massage guests?

A. Different times. There were -- mostly they

was his massage. Mostly he would get massages.

as Would Ms. Maxwell be in the room with him
while he was getting the massage?

A. We don't know. Apparently we saw her going
upstairs, because it was -- when they went upstairs, they
closed -- his quarters, it had a double door, so it was a

door on top of the stairs -- I don't know if you've been

in the house -- and then there's another door going into
his room. So it was a long corridor. So everything was
closed and nobody saw anything.

OD. Would you clean up after?

AG Once in a while, yes, I did. Most of the
times I did. I did the cleanup.

Q. Did it appear as if there was going to be

more than one massage going on in the room?

A. More than one massage? I don't know. It
was massages. There was massages, because it was a hot
oil, and it was -- you know this vibrator, the neck
vibrators with the long handles. And towels, a lot of
towels. We used a lot of towels in the house. Used like
maybe 40, 50 towels a day, because every time he go in
into the pool, it was two or three towels. Everything
had to be cleaned up. I went most of the time to pick up
the room and get it ready.

O. Did it ever appear to you that more went
in the room other than a massage?

A. I just imagine. I never saw anything. But
I imagine there was more than -- I never saw anything
because it was closed doors. It was never done outside.

OE Based on the cleanup?

A. Based on the cleanup -- at the end, I

cannot say there was. At the end, it was a few times

that the bed was undone. You know, we make the beds
three or four times a day. And sometimes we went to
clean up the massage to put it back, the massage table,
to pick up the towels, but the bed was undone again. So
either he took a nap or he went for a nap, I don't know.

A. Mostly they would come alone. It was one

girl, one of the young girls, the one I can't think of

it, she would bring somebody else. She'd bring other
girls. But I didn't even know the names.

Oo, All of them would go downstairs?

A. Yes.

Ae Most of the times when that girl came, it
was at night. So after dinner -- after dinner, they went
to the movies. And by the time they went to the movies,
we clean up right away and tried to get out of there.
And that was about 8, 9 o'clock at night.

After, when they come back, I don't know

Before I even spoke to you.
O., Just when you found the card?

A. When I find the card, I get scared. rE

said, What's going on now? Why are you bothering me now

in my house?
That's why I called him.
He said, John, there is an investigation
going on. I have nothing to talk to you. That's it.
I said, Okay.
O. He didn't give you any information as to --
A. No, not a word.
Q. Has anybody else contacted you from
Mr. Epstein or his organization, his assistants, his
attorney?
A. Ne; mo, mo.
Q. Anyone that works for his attorney?
A. For his attorney? Yes. For his attorney,

the present attorney? Yes. That was an investigator

that it was investigated on his side, I can't remember
his name, but I understand it was from Roy Black's
office. That was his attorney. And he -- this
investigator basically asked me the same questions,
exactly the same questions: What did I know, what did I
know.

When did this happen?

A. This happened about ten days ago -- about a
week ago, ten days ago. I'm not sure what date.

oF Was his investigator's name --

A. It's the date after I contacted you.

== Paul, first name Paul?

Paul, Paul, yes.

You have the last name?

No.

He asked me exactly the same questions.

Did he offer you any money?

Absolutely not. I would not take it.

Did he tell you not to speak to me?

A. No. He says -- no, he told me not to speak
to you. He didn't say that to me. He says, It's your
choice. You make that decision.

And he says, If you hire a lawyer, you make
that decision.

And we feel that was important for us. [I
don't want to be involved with this thing. I'm out of
the job three years ago, and that's why we hired
Mr. Murrell. He suggested that.

Ole Did he ask you if anybody else has been
contacted?

Bus No.

0. Did he tell you that to call him back after

A. No,' mo:
QO. Were you to have any contact with him at

any time after our meeting?

A. If I will have a contact? J have no reason
for it. I have no reason to call Jeffrey or anybody
else. This is over, I hope.

or Well, Mr. Alessi, this is basically an

ongoing investigation, so obviously anything that we

discuss hopefully will stay between us. Because it is

still ongoing, I wouldn't want this out until the
investigation is complete.

A. It"s not going anywhere. Even my kids
don't know it.

O. He contacted you after you called
Mr. Epstein?

A. res.

When I call him and I said, Jeffrey, what's

going on?
He said, John, I don't know what's going
There's an investigation against me.
So then I said, Whew, thank

And that was the end of it.
I think his name was Paul. I only met him
about fifteen minutes, ten minutes.
Q. You met at your house?
A. No, no. I don't want him at my house. We

at Carrabas restaurant, but it was not open, so we

outside Carrabas. It took about ten minutes.

Oo. Going back to the items that were found in

sink, can you describe any of those massagers?

A. I only saw two things: It was a big,
big -- IT think a vibrator. Big (indicating). And it was

think. Rubber thing. And there was a thing you used it
in the back, the vibrator in the back.

O'. What color?

A. We always had those. Not those toys.
Vibrators, we have different types, one for the neck, one
for the back. You know the one that has a battery and
they move, with balls on it, vibrator. That's LE.

That's what I find there. I never find anything else.
Those two things.

A. As many as I can remember.

Q. I know it's been a while.

A. It was Jody. It was Donna. And it was --
it was Virginia. It was -- how many? Virginia, Lana.

It was also a young girl, but she was not a

massage therapist. She came to the house as a friend, I
think. I don't think she was a massage therapist. Her
name was -- as a matter of fact, she's in a soap opera

now, she's a star. Just give me a minute.

Nadya Jorlin, J-O-R-L-I-N.
There also were men masseuses.

Allison. There was an Allison. There was
a Dina. I think every name -- girls' names. In
eleven years, I cannot remember.
Oe That's fine.
A. There were girls coming and going. There
were girls traveling with him as massage therapists.
They would travel with him all over the world, because he

was in the plane, he got massages on the plane,

because -- I know because I used to supply the oils and

OQ. Would you clean his plane too?

a NO, lO.

. Did you ever travel with him anywhere?

A. No, mo.

oF When he went to New York or Arizona or his
private island?

A. I've been on his island. I've been as a
guest, as a vacation. We just took vacations, and I went
to his island in the Caribbean. And I've been in New
Mexico. I've been at his house in London. But not as a
worker, just vacation.

hs As a vacation?

A. Uh=hub .

We went to New Mexico for -- it was kind of
a symposium about how to clean homes. It was this lady
who make -- teach all the house people, housemen, and
they invited us to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to teach us how
to clean homes. That was kind of stupid.

Oe How he wanted it to be cleaned?

A. Yes. We didn't get that much.

Oc Can you think of anything that I haven't
asked you that might be relevant to this?

A. i can’t think of anything. -Basically it's

the same questions that the other investigator asked me.

THE PALM BEACH POST

e TUESDAY, AUGUST 8, 2006 9B

Attorney: Police gave media ‘distorted view’

B EPSTEIN from 1B

They did that Monday via Gold-
berger and a Los Angeles publicist
for Miami criminal defense attorney

Roy Black, who also has represented ©

Epstein in the case.

“We just think there has been a
distorted view of this case in the me-
dia presented by the Palm Beach po-
lice,” Goldberger said.

Reiter has consistently declined
to comment on the case and did not
respond to a request for comment
Monday.

- The implication that State Attor-
ney Barry Krischer was easy on Ep-
stein by presenting the case to a
grand jury rather than filing charges

directly against him is wrong, Gold-
berger said.

‘The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment was “happy and ecstatic” that
the panel was going to review the
evidence. “I think what happened is
they weren’t happy with the result.
They decided to use the press to
embarrass Mr. Epstein.”

But records show that Reiter
wrote Krischer on May 1 — well be-
fore the case wentto the grand jury —
suggesting that Krischer “consider if
good and sufficient reason exists to
require your disqualification from the
prosecution of these cases.”

Rather than flat-out decline to
charge Epstein, Krischer referred
the case to the grand jury to “ap-

pease” the chief, Goldberger said.

A state attorney’s spokesman
would say only that the office refers
cases to the grand jury when there
are issues with the viability of the
evidence or witnesses’ credibility.

Both the state attorney and the
grand jury concluded there was not
sufficient evidence that Epstein had
sex with minors, according to Gold-
berger. “It was just a childish perfor-
mance by the Palm Beach Police
Department,” Goldberger said.

The defense attorney said one of
the alleged victims who claimed she
was a minor was in fact over the age
of 18. Another alleged victim who
was subpoenaed to testify to the
grand jury failed to do so. Epstein’s

Chief Michael Reiter to State Attorney
Barry Krischer on the Epstein probe.

accusers, he added, have histories of
drug abuse and thefts. “These wom-
en are liars. We've established that.”

But why would they all invent
their stories about meeting Epstein
for sexual massages?

“I don’t have an answer as to what
was the motivation for these women
to come forward and make these al-
legations,” Goldberger said.

Indictment: Billionaire solicited 3 inion |

Palm Beach police will report
today about their prostitution
probe of the money manager.

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Billionaire money manager and
Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey
Epstein solicited or procured prostitutes
three or more times between Aug. 1 and
Oct. 31 of last year, according to an in-
dictment charging him with felony so-
licitation of prostitution.

‘Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm
Beac County ‘jail at 1:45 am. Sunday.
He was released on $3,000 bond.

Epstein’s case is unusual in that
suspected prostitution johns are usually
charged with a misdemeanor, and even
a felony charge is typically made in a
criminal information — an alternative to
an indictment charging a person with

the commission of a
crime.

His attorney, Jack
Goldberger, declined to
discuss the charge.

State attorney's of-
fice spokesman Mike
Edmondson also had
little to say.

“Generally _speak-
ing, there is a case that
has a number of different aspects to it,”
Edmondson said of a_ prostitution-
related charge being submitted to a
grand jury. “We first became aware of
the case months ago by Palm Beach
police.”

Prosecutors and police worked to-
gether to bring the case to the grand
jury, he said..

Palm Beach police confirmed that
and said the department will release a
report today regarding its investigation.

Epstein has owned a five-bedroom,
7'%-bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a
pool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal

Waterway since 1990, according to
property records. A man answering the
door there Monday said that Epstein
wasn't home. A Cadillac Escalade reg-
istered to him was parked in the drive-
way, which is flanked by two massive
gargoyles.

Epstein sued Property Appraiser
Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that
the assessment of his home exceeded
its fair market value. He dismissed his
lawsuit in December 2002.

A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fa
magazine said he owns what are be-
lieved to be the largest private homes in
Manhattan — 51,000 square feet — and
in New Mexico — a 7,500-acre ranch.
Those are in addition to his 70-acre is-
land in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet
of aircraft

Epstein’s friends and admirers, ac-
cording to the magazine, include prom-
inent businessmen, academics and sci-
entists and famed Harvard law professor
Alan Dershowitz.

Mystery money man faces soliciting charge

By NICOLE JANOK
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
A part-time Palm Beacher who has
socialized with Donald Trump, Bill
Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed

early Sunday with accused drug dealers,

drunken drivers and wife beaters after
he was charged with ata a prosti-
tute.

Manhattan money manager Jeffrey
Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home
on El Brillo Way at 1:45 am. He was
released hours later on $3,000 bond.

07/26/17

Epstein was indicted last week bya
state grand jury, according to state at-
torney’s spokesman Mike Edmondson.
Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment
containing the allegations remained
sealed Sunday and Edmondson provid-
ed no details.

Unlike most accused johns, Epstein

was charged with a third-degree felony

instead of a misdemeanor. Under state
law, a solicitation charge usually is ele-
vated to a more-serious felony when the
defendant has at least two solicitation

convictions.

However, checks of court records
here and in New York Sunday turned up
no such convictions. .

Epstein could not be reached. ory

Goldberg, who declined comment.

He has been in trouble
before. In 1993, he and two

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS

Because of reporting errors, The
Palm Beach Post Monday said that Jeffrey
Epstein, a parttime Palm Beach resi-
dent, pleaded guilty in 1993 to a charge of
conspiring to steal U.S. Treasury checks.
That was another Jeffrey Epstein, not the
one indicted here on a prostitution so-
licitation charge. Jeffrey Epstein of Palm
Beach has never been charged with
postal larceny and theft of U.S. Treasury
checks, has never pleaded guilty and has
never been on probation. The story also

incorrectly said that Epstein was arrest-
ed Sunday at his Palm Beach home. He
surrendered at the Palm Beach County
Jail, according to his attorney, Jack
Goldberger. Goldberger’s name also
was misspelled in the article. The story
appeared on the front page of the Local
section.

MWLYVILUMMy JUL! £U, 2UU0

Police kept watch on home, airport, sifted through wvddh

& EPSTEIN from 18

suggesting the county’s top
prosecutor disqualify himself.

“I must urge you to ex-
amine the unusual course that
your office’s handling of this
matter has taken and consider
if good and sufficient reason
exists to require your dis-
qualification from the prose-
cution of these cases,” Reiter
wrote in a May 1 memo to
Krischer.

While not commenting
specifically on the Epstein
case, Mike Edmondson,
spokesman for the state at-
torney, said his office pre-
sents cases other than mur-
ders to a grand jury when
there are questions about
witnesses’ credibility and
their ability to testify.

By the nature of their jobs,
police officers look at evi-
dence from a “one-sided per-
spective,” ondson said.
“A prosecutor has to look at it
in a much broader fashion,”
weighing the veracity of wit-
nesses and how they may fare
under defense attorneys’
Shearing he said.

Epstein’s attorney, Jack
Goldberger, said his client
committed no crimes.

“The reports and. state-
ments in question refer to
false accusations that were
not charged because the Palm
Beach County state attorney
questioned the credibility of
the witnesses,” Goldberger

said. A county grand jury
“found the allegations wholly
unsubstantiated and not
credible,” and that’s why his
client was not charged with
sexual activity with minors,
he said.

Goldberger said Epstein
passed a lie detector test ad-
ministered by a reputable
polygraph examiner in which
he said he did not know the
girls were minors. Also, a
search warrant served on
Epstein’s home found no evi-
dence to corroborate the
girls’ allegations, Goldberger
said.

According to police docu-
ments:

@ A Palm Beach Commu-
nity College student said she
gave Epstein a massage in the
nude, then brought him six
girls, ages 14 to 16, for mas-
sage and sex-tinged sessions
at his home.

BA 27-year-old woman
who worked as_ Epstein’s
personal assistant also facili-
tated the liaisons, phoning
the PBCC student to arrange
for girls when Epstein was
coming to town. And she es-
corted the girls upstairs when
they arrived, putting fresh
sheets onamassage table and
placing massage oils nearby.

@ Police took sworn
statements from five alleged
victims and. 17 witnesses.
They contend that on three
occasions, Epstein had sex
with the girls.

Chief Michael Reiter wrote to
State Attorney Barry Krischer

on the Epstein case.

A money manager for the
ultra-rich, Epstein was named
one of New York's most eligi-
ble bachelors in 2003 by The
New York Post. He reportedly
hobnobs with the likes of
former President Clinton,
former Harvard University
President Lawrence Sum-
mers and Donald Trump, and
has lavish homes in Manhat-
tan, New Mexico and the Vir-
gin Islands.

He has contributed tens of
thousands of dollars to Dem-
ocratic Party candidates and
organizations, including Sen.
John Kerry’s presidential bid,
and the Senate campaigns of
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clin-
ton, Christopher Dodd and
Charles Schumer.

Goldberger is one of five
attorneys Epstein has re
tained since he became the
subject of an investigation,
Edmondson said. Among the
others: Alan Dershowitz, the
well-known Harvard law pro-
fessor and author, who is a
friend of Epstein. Dershowitz
could not be reached for
comment.

Police -said the woman
who enlisted young girls for
Epstein was Haley Robson,

20, of Royal Palm Beach.
Robson has worked at an OL
ive Garden restaurant in
Wellington and said she was a
journalism major at Palm
Beach Community College
when she was questioned by
police last October. She has
an unlisted phone number
and could not be reached for
comment.

Robson said she met Ep-
stein when, at age 17, a friend
asked her if she would like to
make monéy giving him a
massage. She said she was
driven to his five-bedroom,
7-bath home on the Intra-
coastal Waterway, then es-
corted upstairs to a bedroom
with a massage table and oils.
Epstein and Robson were
both naked during the mas-
sage, she said, but when he
grabbed her buttocks, she
said she didn’t want to be
touched.

Epstein said he’d pay her
to bring him more girls — the
younger the better, Robson
told police. When she tried
once to bring a 23-year-old
woman to him, Epstein said
she was too old, Robson said.

Robson, who has not been
charged in the case, said she
eventually brought six girls to
Epstein who were paid $200
each time, Robson said. “I’m
like a Heidi Fleiss,” police
quoted her as saying. The
girls knew what to expect
when they were taken to Ep-
stein’s home, Robson said.

Give a massage — maybe na-
ked and allow some
touching.

One 14-year-old girl Rob-
son took to meet Epstein led
police to start the investiga-
tion of him in March 2005. A
relative of the girl called to say
she thought the child had re-
cently engaged in sex with a
Palm Beach man. The girl
then got into a fight with a
classmate who accused her of
being a prostitute, and she
couldn’t explain why she had
$300 in her purse.

The girl gave police this
account of her meeting with
Epstein:

She accompanied Robson
and a second girl to Epstein’s
house on a Sunday in Febru-
ary 2005. Once there, a wom-
an she thought was Epstein’s
assistant told the girl to follow
her upstairs to a room featur-
ing amural ofa naked woman,
several photographs of naked
women on a shelf, a hot pink
and green sofa and amassage
table.

_ She stripped to her bra
and panties and gave him a
massage.

Epstein gave the 14-year-
old $300 and she and the oth-
er girls left, she said. She said
Robson told her that Epstein
paid her $200 that day.

Other girls told similar
stories. In most accounts,
Epstein’s personal assistant at
the time, Sarah Kellen, now
27, escorted the girls to Ep

stein’s bedroom.

Kellen, whose most re-
cent known address is in
North Carolina, has not been
charged in the case.

Palm Beach police often
conducted surveillance of
Epstein’s home, and at Palm
Beach International Airport
to see if his private jet was
there, so they would know
when he was in town. Police
also arranged repeatedly to
receive his trash from Palm
Beach sanitation workers,
collecting papers with names
and phone numbers, sex toys
and female hygiene products.

One note stated that a fe-
male could not come over at 7
p.m. because of soccer. An-
other said a girl had to work
Sunday — “Monday after
school?” And _ still another
note contained the work
hours of a girl, saying she
leaves school at 11:30 a.m.
and would come over the next
day at 10:30 a.m.

Only three months before
the police department probe
began, Epstein donated
$90,000 to the department for
the purchase of a firearms
simulator, said Jane Struder,
town finance director. The
purchase was never made.
The money was returned to
Epstein on Monday, she said.
Staff writers Andrew Marra
and Tim O’Meilia and staff re-
searcher Angelica Cortez con-
tributed to this story.

RE: Mr. Epstein
From Aileen Josephs, Esq.

Ms. Sanchez:

Women in our County have been watching this case with great
concern. I strongly suggest that you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel
your client is innocent, you can file a libel suit- of course, the truth is an
absolute defense to libel, and please keep in mind that not knowing the age
of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime committed
against a child.

Sincerely,

n Manhattan’s
Upper Eagt Side, home to some of the
most expensive real estate on earth, exists
the crown jewel of the city’s residential
town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door,
huge arched windows, and nine floors, it
sits on—or. rather. commands—the block
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro-
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors. it seems more like an institution than
a house. This is perhaps not surprising—
until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's
largest private residence.

Inside. amid the flurry of menservants
attired in sober black suits and pristine
white gloves, you feel you have stumbled
into someone’s private Xanadu. This is
no mere rich person’s home, but a high-
walled. eclectic. imperious fantasy that
seems to have no boundaries.

The entrance hall is decorated not with
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eyeballs: these. the owner
tells people with relish, were imported from
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer,
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any
case. guests are like pygmies next to the
nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked
African warrior,

Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal. the statement of someone
who wants to be known for the scale of his
possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey
Epstein, 50, admuts to friends that he likes it
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren,
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered
face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts,
and loafers. He tells people he bought the
house because he knew he “could never live
anywhere bigger.” He thinks 51,000 square
feet is an appropriately large space for some-
one like himself, who deals mostly in large
concepts—especially large sums of money.

302Q7/9/T7ZTY FAIR

Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at
the town house—Epstein usually refers to the
former as “tea,” since he likes to eat bite-
size morsels and drink copious quantities of
Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or to-
bacco.) Tea is served in the “leather room,”
so called because of the cordovan-colored
fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered
in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a
huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling li-
onskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger
sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and
guests by the menservants in white gloves.

Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the “office,” an enormous gallery
spanning the width of the house. Strangely,
it holds no computer. Computers belong in
the “computer room” (a smaller room at
the back of the house). Epstein has been
known to say. The office features a gilded
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged
to banker J. P. Morgan). I8th-century black
lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-
foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the
desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de
Sade’s The Misforrunes of Virnte was re-
cently spotted. Covering the floor. Epstein
has explained. “is the largest Persian rug
you'll ever see in a private home—so big, it
must have come from a mosque.” Amid
such splendor, much of which reflects the
work of the French decorator Alberto Pin-
to. who has worked for Jacques Chirac and
the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Ara-
bia, there is one particularly startling oddi-
ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop
the grand piano. “No decorator would ever
tell you to do that.” Epstein brags to visi-
tors. “But I want people to think what it
means to stuff a dog.” People can't help
but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he
always has the last word.

In addition to the town house, Epstein
lives in what is reputed to be the largest
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an $18
million, 7300-acre ranch which he named
“Zorro.” “It makes the town house look like
a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns
Little St. James. a 70-acre island in the
USS. Virgin Islands, where the main house
is currently being renovated by Edward Tut-
tle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is
also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach,
Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream
IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete
with trading room, on which Epstein re-
cently flew President Clinton, actors Chris
Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket
magnate Ron Burkle. Lew Wasserman’s
grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few oth-
ers, On a mission to explore the problems of

Epstein is charming. but he doesn’t let

Page 13 of 151

the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely
and calculating, giving some hint at the
steady whir of machinery running behind
them. “Let’s play chess,” he said to me, af-
ter refusing to give an interview for this arti-
cle. “You be white. You get the first move.”
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man
who seems to feel he can win no matter
what the advantage of the other side. His
advantage is that no one really seems to
know him or his history completely or what
his arsenal actually consists of. He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one
of the few truly baffling mysteries among
New York’s moneyed world. People know
snippets, but few know the whole.

“He's very enigmatic.” says Rosa Monck-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in
the U.K. and a close fmend since the early
1980s. “You think you know him and then
you peel off another ring of the onion skin
and there’s something else extraordinary
underneath. He never reveals his hand. .. .
He’s a classic iceberg. What vou see is not
what you get.”

ven acquaintances sense a
curious dichotomy: Yes. he
lives like a “modern ma-
haraja.” as Leah Kleman,
one of his art dealers. puts
it. Yet he is fastidiously. al-
most obsessively private—he
lists himself in the phone book under a
pseudonym. He rarely attends society gath-
erings or weddings or funerals: he considers
eating in restaurants like “eating on the sub-
way ’—Le.. something he'd never do. There
are many women in his life. mostly voung,
but there is no one of them to whom he
has been able to commit. He describes his
most public companion of the last decade,

late, disgraced media baron Robert Max-
well, as simply his “best friend.” He says
she is not on his payroll, but she seems
to organize much of his life—recently she
was making telephone inquiries to find a
California-based yoga instructor for him.
(Epstein is still close to his two other long-
term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher. a for-
mer associate of his at the brokerage firm
Bear Stearns and now an opera producer,
and Eva Andersson Dubin. a doctor and
onetime model. He tells people that when
a relationship is over the girlfriend “moves
up, not down,” to friendship status.)
Some of the businessmen who dine with
him at his home—they include newspaper
publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis
Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman,
real-estate tycoon Leon Black. former Mr
crosoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom
Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels). and real-estate

personality Donald Trump—sometimes
seem not all that clear as to what he ac-
tually does to earn his millions. Certainly,
you won't find Epstein’s transactions writ-
ten about on Bloomberg or talked about in
the trading rooms. “The trading desks don't
seem to know him. It’s unusual for animals
that big not to leave any footprints in the
snow,” says a high-level investment manager.

Unlike such fund managers as George
Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose
client lists and stock maneuverings act as
their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his
deals and clients secret, bar one client: bil-
lionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chair-
man of Limited Brands. Epstein insists that
ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he
has managed money only for billionaires—
who depend on him for discretion. “I was
the only person crazy enough, or
arrogant enough, or misplaced
enough, to make my limit a bil-
lion dollars or more,” he tells peo-
ple freely. According to him, the
flat fees he receives from his clients,
combined with his skill at playing
the currency markets “with very
large sums of money,” have afforded
him the lifestyle he enjoys today.

Why do billionaires choose him
as their trustee? Because the prob-
lems of the mega-rich, he tells peo-
ple. are different from yours and
mine, and his unique philosophy is
central to understanding those problems:
“Verv few people need any more money
when they have a billion dollars. The kev
is not to have it do harm more than any-
thing else.... You don’t want to lose your
money.”

e has likened his job to
that of an architect—more
specifically, one who spe-
cializes in remodeling: “I
always describe [a bullion-
aire] as someone who
started out in a small
home and as he became wealthier had add-
ons. He added on another addition, he built
a room over the garage ... until you have a
house that is usually a mess.... It’s a large
house that has been put together over time
where no one could foretell the financial fu-
ture and their accompanying needs.”

He makes it sound as though his job
combines the roles of real-estate agent, ac-
countant, lawyer, money manager, trustee,
and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby,
myths and rumor swirl around Epstein.

Here are some of the hard facts about
Epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people
knowing: He—gréwaip- middle-class in

parents viewed educa-
tion as “the way out”
for him and his young-
er brother. Mark, now
working in real estate.
Jeffrey started to play
the piano—for which he
maintains a passion—at
five, and he went to
Brooklyn's Lafayette High
School. He was good at
mathematics, and in his
early 20s he got a job teaching physics and
math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan pri-
vate school. While there he began tutoring
the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace
Greenberg and was friendly with a daugh-
ter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear
Stearns, where. under the mentorship of
both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns
C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough
to become a limited partner—a rung be-
neath full partner. He abruptly departed in
1981 because, he has said, he wanted to
run his own business.

Thereafter the details recede into shad-
ow. A few of the handful of current frends
who have known him since the early 1980s

recall that he used to tell them he was a

rapidly, which is to me terrific because we
have shorter meetings.”

senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of

distinguished scientists, most of whom
Epstein has helped fund in recent years.

does not deny that he and Wexner have a

“I think we both possess the skill of
seeing patterns,” says Wexner. “But Jef-

and fashion trends. My skills are not in in-

being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.”
One reporter, in fact, received three threats
from Epstein while preparing a piece. They
were delivered in a jocular tone, but the
message was clear: There‘ will be trouble
for your family if I don’t like the article.
On the other hand, Epstein is clearly
very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an
Aspen-based venture capitalist, who has
known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns
days. can’t say enough nice things: “I have
a boy who's dyslexic. and Jeffrey’s gotten
close to him over the years.... Jeffrey got
him into music. He bought him his first
piano. And then as he got to school he had
difficulty ... in studving ... so Jeffrey got
him interested in taking flying lessons.”
Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling
her that her. daughter. Domenica, who suf-
fers from Down syndrome. needed the sun,
and that Rosa should feel free to bring her
to his house in Palm Beach anytime.
Some friends remember that in the late
80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the air-
line tickets of good trends by affixing first-
class stickers: the only problem was that the
stickers turned out to be unofficial. Some-
times the technique worked. but other times
it didnt. and the unwitting recipients found
themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has
claimed that he paid for the upgrades, and
had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of
those who benefited trom Epstein’s largesse
claim that his generosity comes with no
strings attached. “I never felt he wanted
anvthing from me in return.” says one old
friend. who received a first-class upgrade.

pstein is known about town
as a man who loves wom-
en—lots of them. mostly
young. Model types have
been heard saying they are
full of gratitude to Epstein
for flying them around, and
he is a familiar face to many of the Victo-
rias Secret girls. One voung woman recalls
being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to
a concert at Epstein’s town house. where
the women seemed to outnumber the men
by far. “These were not women you'd see
at Upper East Side dinners,” the woman
recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed
a little bizarrely.” This same guest also at-
tended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell
that Prince Andrew attended, which was
filled, she says, with young Russian mod-
els. “Some of the guests were horrified,”
the woman says.

“He’s reckless,” says a former business
associate, “and he’s gotten more so. Mon-
ey does that to you. He’s breaking the oath
he made to himself—that he would never
do anything that would expose him in the

uw AQH26/46 0 3

media. Right now, in the wake of the pub-
licity following his trip with Clinton, he
must be in a very difficult place.”

ecording to S.E.C. and
other legal documents un-
earthed by Vanity Fair,
Epstein may have good
reason to keep his past
cloaked in secrecy: his real
mentor. it might seem, was
not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffen-
berg, 57, who, for a few months before the
S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993. was
trying to buy the New York Post. He is cur-
rently incarcerated in the Federal Medical
Center in Devens. Massachusetts. serving a
20-year sentence for bilking investors out of
more than $450 million in one of the largest
Ponzi schemes in American history.

When Epstein met Hoffenberg in Lon-
don in the 1980s, the latter was the char-
ismatic, audacious head of the Towers
Financial Corporation. a collection agency
that was supposed to buy debts that peo-
ple owed to hospitals. banks, and phone
companies. But Hotfenberg began using
company funds to pav off earlier investors
and service a lavish lifestvle that included a
mansion on Long Island. homes on Man-
hattan’s Sutton Place and in Florida. and a
fleet of cars and planes.

Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in
common, Both were smart and obsessed
with making money. Both were from Brook-
lyn. According to Hoffenberg. the nvo men
were introduced by Douglas Leese. a de-
fense contractor, Epstein his said they were
introduced by John Mitchell. the late attor-
ney general.

Epstein had been running International
Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.). a consulting
company. out of his apartment in the Solo
building on East 66th Street in New York.
Though he has claimed that he managed
money for billionaires only, in a [989 dep-
osition he testified that he spent $0 per-
cent of his time helping people recover
stolen money from fraudulent brokers and
lawyers. He was also not above entering
into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals
with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that
Michael Stroll, the former head of Wil-
liams Electronics Inc.. filed against Epstein
shows that in 198? LA.G. received an in-
vestment from Stroll of $450,000, which
Epstein put into oil. In 1984, Stroll asked
for his money back: four years later he had
received only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit,
after Epstein claimed in court, among oth-
er things, that the check for $10,000 was for
a horse he'd bought from Stroll. “My net
worth never exceeded four and a half mil-
hon dollars.” Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, “really
liked Jeffrey... . Jeffrey has a way of getting
under your skin, and he was under Hof-
fenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg
were Epstein’s social connections; they in-
cluded oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the
designer Vera) and Mohan Murjani, whose
clothing company grew into Gloria Van-
derbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even then.
One friend recalls that when he took Cana-
dian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he
hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the oc-
casion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)

In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources,
set Epstein up in the offices he still occu-
pies in the Villard House. on Madison Ay-
enue. across a courtyard from the restaurant
Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new pro-
tégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month.
and the relationship flourished. “They tray-
eled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s
plane. all around the world, thev were al-
ways together,” says a source. Hoffenberg
has claimed that Epstein confided in him.
saying. for example. that he had left Bear
Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered ex-
ecuting “illegal operations.”

Several of Epstein’: Bear Stearns contem-
poraries recall that Epsiein left the compa-
nv very suddenly. Within the company there
Were rumors also that he was involved in a
technical infringement. and it was thought
that the executive commuttee asked that he

berg and Jimmy Cavne. were outmumbered.
Greenberg says he can’t recall this: Cayne
denies it happened. and Epstein has de-
nied it as well. “Jetfrey Epstein left Bear
Stearns of his own volition.” says Cayne.
“It was never suggested that he leave by
any member of management. and manage-
ment never looked into any improprieties
by him. Jeffrey said specifically. ‘I don't
want to work for anybody else. I want to
work for myself. Yet. this is not the story
that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and
to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a
civil business case in Philadelphia.

In 1981 the $.E.C.’s Jonathan Harns and
Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony
and that of other Bear Stearns employees in
part of what became a protracted case
about insider trading around a tender offer
placed on March Il, 1981, by the Seagram
Company Lu! for St. Joe Minerals Corp.
Ultimately several Italian and Swiss in-
vestors were found guilty. including Italian
financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used
his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about
the tender offer.

antains a parody of Affleck and Matt Da-
ton making Good Will Hunting I, Affleck
ys to Damon, “What do I keep telling you?
bu gotta do the safe picture, then you do
te art picture. Then sometimes you gotta
@ the payback picture because your friend
sys you owe him. Then sometimes you got-
tigo back to the well.”

“Sometimes you do Reindeer Games,”
Ikmon says derisively.

“That's just mean,” Affleck whines.

But it’s a pretty accurate description of
hi career to date. “Ben takes these franchise
poperties so he can go and experiment,”
sas Harvey Weinstein.

“He believes in trying to stretch himself
aid not!keep doing the same thing,” ob-
seves Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck
indrmageddon. “He's an awesome actor,
ant [ think he’s going to do great things.”

Several years ago. in a televised interview
onénside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that
hisgoal was to make big commercial movies.
He has since revised his ambitions. “That's
anadolescent aspiration, in a way. I’d
rater be in movies like Magnolia, which I
thnk is a towering achievement. I'll con-
lime to act, but I won't act in a way that
requires me to hang my name out there
ant do a lot of publicity. I'll do character
roks and focus on writing and directing. It
doesn't require the same kinds of sacri-
fice, in terms of quality of life and person-
al life. and it’s a more holistic approach to
theprocess. It's become increasingly frus-

trating for me to have my role in the story-
telling process limited to one character. You
have to be respectful and judicious about

your input when it’s somebody else’s project.”

Affleck has always impressed colleagues
with his voracious appetite for information
and skills. “He has made it a point to learn
everything he can about how the business
works—not just the craft of acting, but
from the producing standpoint, from the
studio standpoint,” says Jon Gordon, exec-
utive vice president of production at Mira-
max. “He knows how deals work. It’s what
sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio
at some point, he could. He’s about as
sharp as they come.”

fleck is already juggling his acting with

screenwriting and such other commit-
ments as Project Greenlight. the contest he
and Damon started to help launch the ca-
reers of young filmmakers. Affieck’s friends
are certain he'll be directing soon. “There's
no question,” Weinstein says. “Both he and
Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the
rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll
be home runs in both instances.”

But there are other thoughts tickling the
back of Affleck’s mind as well. A passion-
ate liberal, he campaigned for Al Gore,
cares deeply about political issues. and ts
extremely well informed. He entertains him-
self by writing imaginary political speeches
in his head. He would rather discuss AIDs
in Africa than his movie career.

When Lopez goes to Affleck’s mother’s
house for dinner. Weinstein reports, “J.Lo
told me that the conversation at the table is
always about politics—about government
initiatives, educauional initiatives, what's go-
ing on in the day.”

So Is Affleck planning to become the lib-
erals’ answer to Ronald Reagan’ He admits
that he entertains the thought of someday
running for Congress, at least: “I think there's
a real nobility to public service. It would be
fun to run on a platform I really bel:~ ed
in, without any of the kind of compron: <s
people make—without being beholden
the win-at-all-costs mentality.”

And the invasion of privacy would be
nothing new. “What are you going to say
about me that hasn’t already been said? |
don't cheat. I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs.
I live a clean life.” Affleck says, his eyes
twinkling.

“He's only 30 vears old,” says Jennifer
Todd. who co-produced Boiler Room. “He
still has an enormous amount of time to
do things.”

Time. and drive. “I think he’s incredibly
hungry.” savs Sean Bailey. who founded
the media and production company Live-
Planet with Affleck. Damon. and Chris
Moore. “I think the guy has verv grand
aspirations. I don't think he’s going to be
content with just being a movie star. He
knows he has the petential to do very big
things.”

Such ambitions could be derailed by any
number of miscalculations. including a pri-
vate life that generates too many sensational
headlines, but Affleck has a clear idea of
the ultimate goal. “On my deathbed. I have
to be one who looks back and feels I lived
a good and substantial and meaningful
lite.” he savs.

In the meantime. howe. er. there’s a wed-
ding to plan.

Jeffrey Epstein

CoNTINvED FROM pace 305 Bear Stearns
and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear
Steams on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped
off that Epstein had information on insider
trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testi-
mony, given on April |, 1981, Epstein claimed
that he had found “offensive” the way Bear
Stearns management had handled a disci-
plinary action following its discovery that he
had committed a possible “Reg D” viola-
tion—evidently he had lent money to his clos-
est friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said
that he'd lent approximately $20.000 to War-
ren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action
could have been considered improper, al-
though Epstein claimed he had not realized
this until afterward.

According to Epstein, Bear Stearns man-
agement had questioned him about the loan
around March 4. The questioners, Epstein

said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopo! and
07/26/17

MARoOuU IANA

Alvin Einbender. In his 1989 deposition Ep-
stein recalled that the partner who had made
an “issue” of the matter was Marvin David-
son. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met
with Tarnopol and Einbender again, and the
two partners told him that the executive com-
mittee had weighed the offense. together swith
previous “carelessness” over expenses, and
he would be fined $2.500.

“There was discussion whether, in fact, I
had ever put in an airline ticket for some-
one else and not myself and | said that it
was possible, ... since my secretary han-
dles my expenses.” Epstein told the S.E.C.
In his 1989 testimony he stated that the
“Reg D” incident had cost him a shot at
partnership that year.

What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially
interested in was whether there was a con-
nection between Epstein’s leaving and the
alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals
by other people at Bear Stearns:

Q: Sir. are you aware that certain rumors may

A: ['m aware that there were many rumors.

Q: Have you heard anv other rumors suggest-
ing that you had made a presentation or com-
munication to the Executive Committee con-
cerning alleged improprieties by other mem-
bers or employees of Bear Stearns?

A: I, in fact, have heard that rumor, but it’s been
from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.
Q: Have you heard it from anyone else?

A: No.

A little later the interview focuses on
James ‘ayne:

And still later in the questioning comes this
exchange:

Q: Have you had any type of business deal-
ings with Mr. Cayne?

A: There’s no relationship with Bear Stearns.
Q: Pardon?

A: Other than Bear Stearns, no.

Q: Have you been a participant in any type of

A: No.

Q: Do you have any expectation of participat-
ing injany business venture with Mr. Cayne?
A: No.

Q: Have you had any business participations
with Mr, Theram?

A: No: nor do [ anticipate any.

Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns
ell you in words or substance that you should
iot divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to
lhe staff of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission?

A: No.

Q: Has anvone indicated to you in any wavy.
éther directly or indirectly. in words or sub-
Sance. that your compensation for this past
War or any future monies coming to yeu from
Bear Stearns will be contingent upon your not
dvulging information to the Securites and
Exchange Commission?

A: No.

Despite the circumstances of Epstein’s
leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his
annual bonus—which he anticipated as be-
ing approximately $100.000.

The S.E.C. never brought any charges
against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider
trading in St. Joe. but its questioning seems
to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein’s
answers. Some sources have wondered
why. if he was such a big producer at Bear
Stearns. he would have given it up over a
mere $2,500 fine.

Certainly the vears after Epstein left the
firm were not obviously prosperous ones.
His luck didn't seem to change until he met
Hoffenberg.

ne of Epstein’s first assignments for Hof-

fenberg was to mastermind doomed bids
to take over Pan American World Airways in
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988.
Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before
a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up
with the idea of financing these bids through
Towers’s acquisition of two ailing Illinois
insurance companies, Associated Life and
United Fire. “He was hired by us to work on
the securities side of the insurance companies
and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a
profit for us and for the companies,” Hoffen-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also
alleged that Epstein was the “technician.” ex-

ecuting the schemes, although. having no
broker’s license, he had to rely on others to
make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg’s sub-
sequent testimony in his criminal case has
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed
he was merely asked how the bids could be
accomplished and has said he had nothing
to do with the financing of them. Yet Rich-
ard Allen, the former treasurer of United
Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three
times at the company. He and another ex-
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finances. And in his deposition
of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one
who executed “all” Hoffenberg’s instructions
to buy and sell the stock. He called it “mak-
ing the orders.” He could not recall whether
he had chosen the brokers used.

To win approval trom the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Towers’ acquisition of
the companies, Hoffenberg promised to in-

ject $3 million of new capital into them. In

fact. in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg
claimed that he. his chief operating officer.
Mitchell Brater, and Epstein came up with a
scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance
companies’ bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock, “Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater
arranged the various brokerage accounts fot
the bonds to be placed with in New York.
and | think one in Chicago, Rodman & Ren-
shaw,” Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then.
said Hoffenberg. while making it appear as
though they were investing the bonds in
much safer financial instruments. thev used
them as collateral to buy the stock. “Ep-
stein was the person in charge of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Brater was assisting
him with tt in coordination on behalf of the
insurance companies’ money.” Hotlenberg
claimed at the time.

At one point. according to Hoffenberg. a
broker forged the documents necessary for a
$L8 million check to be written on insurance-
company funds. The check was used to buy
more stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to threw the insurance regula-
tors off. the $1.8 million was reported as being
safely invested in a money-market account.

United Fire's former chief financial officer
Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg’s
account. He says he recalls making one or
two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffen-
berg’s direction) about the missing bonds.
“He said, “Oh, yeah. they still exist’ But we
found out later that he had sold those assets
... leveraged them ... [and] used some mar-
gin account to take some positions in...
Emery and Pan Am.” says Payton.

Epstein’s extraordinary creativity was, ac-
cording to Hoffenberg. responsible for the
purchase by the insurance companies of a
$500,000 bond, with no money down. “Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a
$500.000 treasury bond that would not be
shown ... fas] margined or collateralized.”

he reportedly told the grand jury. “It looked
like it was free and clear but it actually
wasn't,” he said.

Epstein has denied he ever had anv deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls
talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg’s direction
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve
the missing bonds for a state examination.
According to Allen, Epstein said, “We'll get
them back.” He had “kind of a flippant atti-
tude,” says Allen. “They never camé back.”

pstein. according to Hoffenberg. also

came up with a scheme to manipulate
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at-
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred
when Hoffenberg’s bid went wrong and the
share price began to fall. This was alleged to
have involved multiple clients’ accounts con-
trolled by Epstein.

Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in
Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case.
and Epstein, who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of any
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who
was handling the suit for the regulators. says
of Epstein. “He was verv elusive.... It was
hard to really track him down. There were a
substantial number of checks for significant
dollars that were paid to him. I remem-
ber. ... He was this character we never got a
handle on. Again we presumed that he was
involved with the Pan Am and Emery run
that Hofienberg made. but we never sot a
chance to depose him.”

“From the government's discovery in the
main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would
seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy.”
says David Lewis. who represented Mitchell
Brater. “They went for what they knew they
could get ... and that was the fraudulent
promissory notes [i.e., the much larger and
unrelated part of Hoffenberg’s fraud. based
in New York State].... What they couldn't
get. they didn't bother with.”

Another lawyer involved in the criminal
prosecution of Hoffenberg says. “In a crim-
inal investigation like that. when there is a
guilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it.
discovery is always incomplete.... They
don't have to line up witnesses: they don't
have to learn every fact that might come out
on cross-examination.”

E pstein was involved with Hoffenberg in
other questionable transactions. Finan-
cial records show that in 1988 Epstein in-
vested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a
company that manufactures football helmets.
Among his co-investors were the theater
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney

whose identity they could not be allowed to
know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the mon-
ey came from him, and Towers’s financial
statements for that year show a loan to Ep-
stein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he
can't remember the details and has dis-
puted the accuracy of the Towers financial
reports.)

Around the same time, Nederlander and
Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a
Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan
was to group together with two other parties
to take a substantial declared position in the
stock. According to a source. Epstein was
supposed tb help Nederlander and Toboroff
raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to find
other investors, say those familiar with the
deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an in-
vestor.) He invested $1 million, which he
told his co-investors was his own money.
But in his 1989 deposi-
tion he said that he put
in only $300,000 of his
own money. Where did
the rest come from? Hof-
fenberg has said it came
from him. in a loan that
Nederlander and Toboroff
didn't know about.

Two things happened
that alarmed Nederlander
and Toboroff. After the
group signaled a possible
takeover, the Pennwalt
management threatened to
sue the would-be raiders.
Epstein was reluctant ini-
tially to give a deposition
about his share of the
money. telling Toboroff
there were “reasons” he
didn’t want to. Then. after the opportunity
for new investors was closed, co-investors
recall Epstein announcing that he'd found
one at last: Dick Snyder. then C.E.O. of
the publisher Simon & Schuster. who want-
ed to put up approximately $500.000. (Nei-
ther Epstein nor Snyder can now recall
the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition
Epstein said that he had recruited Sny-
der, whom he had met socially, into the
deal.)

According to a source, Toboroff and Ne-
derlander told Epstein that Snyder was too
lute. but, without their realizing it, Hoffen-
berg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to
Hoffenberg and bought out some of his in-
vestment. But then Snyder wanted out.

“Nederlander started to get these irate
calls from [Snyder,] who wasn’t part of the
deal, saying he was owed all this money.”
says someone close to the deal. Toborotf
aut * Nederlander were baffled.

“iyually, a source close to Hoffenberg
orp eaberg paid Snyder off.

ust as Nederlander and Toboroff were
J growing wary of Epstein, he became in-
creasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom
he had met through insurance executive
Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has
told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in
Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence
by persuading him not to invest in the stock
market, just as the 1987 crash was approach-
ing. His story has subsequently changed.
When asked if Wexner knew about his con-
nection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he
began working for Wexner in 1989, and that
“it was certainly not the same time.”

Wherever and whenever it was that Ep-
stein and Wexner actually met. there was
an immediate and strong personal chem-
istry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is “very
smart with a combination of excellent judg-
ment and unusually high standards. Also,
he is always a most loval friend.”

OFFICE SPACE

The “office” in Epstein’s house. It has no
computers, but it does have a desk that
Epstein tells people once belonged to banker
J. P. Morgan. and “the largest Persian rug
you'll ever see in a private home.”

Sources say Epstein proved that he could
be useful to Wexner as well, with “fresh”
ideas about investments. “Wexner had a cou-
ple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned
those up right away.” says a former associ-
ate of Epstein’s.

Before he signed on with Wexner, Epstein
had several meetings with Harold Levin, then
head of Wexner Investments, in which he
enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin
found incomprehensible. “In fact.” says some-
one who used to work very closely with Wex-
ner, “almost everyone at the Limited won-
dered who Epstein was: he literally came
out of nowhere.”

“Everyone was mystified as to what his

appeal was, says Sorat Morosky. a former
vice- haiena: of the Limited

Mi of Epstein’s work is related to clean-
ing up, tightening budgets, and efficien-
cies. One person who worked for Wexner and
who saw a contract drawn up between the
two men says Epstein is involved in “every-
thing, not just a little here, a little there.
Everything!” In addition, he says. “Wexner
likes having a hatchet man.... Whenever
there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jef-
frey on it.... He has a reputation for being
ruthless but he gets the job done.”

Epstein has evidently been asked to fire
personal-staff members when needed. “He
was that mysterious person that everyone was
scared to death of.” says a former emplovee.

Meanwhile. he is also less than popular
with some ea outside Wexner’s company
with whom he now deals. “He ‘inserted®
himself into the construction process of Les-
lie Wexner’s yacht.... That resulted in liti-
gation down the road between Mr. Wexner
and the shipyard that
eventually built the ves-
sel.” says Lars Forsberg.
a lawyer whose firm at
ihe time. Dickerson and
Rox. was hired to deal
with iiugation stemming
from the construction
of Wexner’s Limitless—

largest private yachts in
the world. Evidenth. Ep-

Onee or twice in my le-
gal career that I've had

of services that he'd re-
quested and wed per-
formed ... without issue
on the performance.” says Forsberg. In
the end the matter was settled. but Ep-
stein claims he mow has no recollection
of it.

The incident is ore of a number of disputes
Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are
for sums so tiny as to be baffling: for instance.
Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert
Glass, who sold him the Palm Beach house in
1990. for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was
owed him for furnishings removed by Glass.

In 1998 the US. Attorney's Office sued

he is winning. Whether in conversations or
negotiations, he always stands back and lets
the other person determine the style and
manner of the conversation or negotiation.
And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey
sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick
a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you
choose your weapon.”

One case is rather more serious. Currently,
Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on
loans from its private-banking arm for $20
million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraud-
alently induced” him into borrowing the
money for investments. Citibank disputes this
charge.

The legal papers for another case offer a
tare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995,
Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord.
the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his
office in the Villard House. He claimed that
they were breaking the terms of the lease by
tot Jetting his staff in at night. The case was
wentually settled. However, one of the papers
fled in this dispute is Epstein’s financial state-
nent for 1988. in which he claimed to be
worth $20 million. He listed that he owned
$7 million in securities, $1 million in cash,
zero in residential property (although he
told sources that he had already bought the
home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in
other assets. including his investment in
Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: “The
company had been bought with a huge
amount of debt. and it wasn’t public. so it
Was meaningless to attach a figure like that to
it.., the price it cost was about $1.2 mil-
lien.” The co-investors bought out Epstein’s
share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately
$3 million. At that ume, when Epstein was
asked, as a routine matter. to sign a paper
guaranteeing he had access to a few million
dollars in case of anv subsequent disputes
over the sale price. Wexner signed for him.
Epstein has explained that this was because
the co-investors wanted an indemnity against
being sued by Wexner. One of the investors
calls this “bullshit.”

pstein’s appointment to the board of

New York’s Rockefeller University in
2000 brought him into greater social promi-
nence. Boasting such social names as Nancy
Kissinger, Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass,
the board also includes such pre-eminent
scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Gold-
stein. “Epstein was thrilled to be elected,”
says someone who knows him.

After one term Epstein resigned. Accord-
ing to New York magazine, this was because
he didn’t like to wear a suit to meetings. A

okesperson te- the Rockefeller board says

ye 1 because he had insufficient time
oar member recalls that he

gac is

was “arrogant” and “not a good fit.” The
spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent”
for board members not to be renominated
after only one term.

Still, the recent spate of publicity Ep-
stein has inspired does not seem to have
fazed him. In November he was spotted in
the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion
show at New York’s Lexington Avenue Ar-
mory; around the same time the usual co-
terie of friends and beautiful women were
whisked off to Little St. James (which he
tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff)
for a long weekend.

Thanks to Epstein’s introductions, says
Martin Nowak. the biologist finds himself
moving from Princeton to Harvard. where
he is assuming the joint position of profes-
sor of mathematics and professor of biolo-
gy. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million
to Harvard to create the Epstein Program
for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary
Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office
at the university. The program will be dedi-
cated to searching tor nature's algorithms. a
pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak’s. For
Epstein this mus: be the summit of every-
thing he has worked toward: he has been
seen proudly dispiaying Harvard president
Larry Summers's letter of commitment as
if he can’t quite believe it is real. He says he
was reluctant to have his name attached to
the program. but Summers persuaded him.
He rang his mentor Wexner about it. and
Wexner told him it was all nght.

An insatiable. restless soul. always on the
move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount
of downtime into his hectic work schedule.
Yet there is something almost programmed
about his relaxation: it’s as if even plea-

_ sure has to be measured in terms of self-

improvement. Nowak says that. when he

have three-hour conversations about theoret-
ical physics. “Then he'll go otf and do some
work, re-appear. and we'll talk some more.”

Another person who went to the island
with Epstein. Maxwell. and several beautiful
women remembers that the women “sat
around one night teasing him about the
kinds of grasping women who might want
to date him. He was amused by the idea... .
He’s like a king in his own world.”

Many people comment there is some-
thing innocent. almost childlike about Jef-
frey Epstein. They see this as refreshing, given
the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan
Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to
know Epstein. his wife asked him if he would
still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed
for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied,
“Absolutely. | would be as interested in him

Accused of paying underage girls for sex, superrich money manager Jeffrey Epstein is
finding that living in a dream world is dangerous—-even if you can pay for it.

@ By Philip Weiss
® Pubdiished Dec 10, 2007

Corbes?

Jeffrey Epstein is under indictment for sex crimes in Palm Beach, Florida, and I'd expected that when he
came into the office of PR guru Howard Rubenstein, he would be sober and reserved. Quite the
opposite. He was sparkling and ingenuous, apologizing for the half-hour lateness with a charming line—
“T never realized how many one-way streets and no-right-turns there are in midtown. I finally got out
and walked”— and as we went down the corridor to Rubenstein’s office, he asked, “Have you managed
to talk to many of my friends?” Epstein had been supplyirig me the phone numbers of important
scientists and financiers and media figures. “Do you understand what an extraordinary group of people

they are, what they have accomplished in their fields?”

One of the accusers—a girl of 14—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why. His
walk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened
qualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on
his signature outfit: new blue jeans and a powder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his
friend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s
signal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.

I told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic
delight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm
Brooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be sitting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile
formed on Epstein’s bow-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had
never married—I didn’t finish. “‘Are you channeling my mother?”

When I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in
capital letters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,
someone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.

Two years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they
came into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and
soaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his attomey.
“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound
for him, that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $100,000 to Ballet Florida's
massage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.

never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was
negotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that
Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s
likely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the power to
dazzie and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah.” as one friend put it. seemed
to believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn't the least bit tawdry

“He lives ina different environment.” says Sicgal. “He's of this world. But he creates this different

himself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He's very mysterious. Not that many
people get close to him. Not that many people know him.”

of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein’s rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house;
Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein’s forte was dealing with wealthier
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no
footman; be loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who
could show the rich how to live with their money. “I want people to understand the power, the |
responsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. “

lost) when an oil deal didn’t work out.

Stroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. “Everybody who’s his friend thinks he’s so
darn brilliant because he’s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, I never saw him work. Anybody I
know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.”

Those who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind
goes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from
mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct
answer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”

A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to
make connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is
extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also
to identify biological problems without having ali the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an
extremely short attention span. Why?-—it’s not that he’s bored. He has enough information after fifteen

minutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert's
statements.”

Epstein has been a munificent supporter of cutting-edge research. Axe! met Epstein during the early
biotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the
late nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference
on the West Coast in his beautiful 727.

“It was all a little giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a Jittle food out, lovely hors d’oeuvre. And then after
fifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he
had a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual attire. Jeans, no socks,
loafers, a button-down shirt, shirttails out. And he was followed onto the plane by—how shall T say
this? —by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, 18, 19, 20, who
knows? They were model-like. They towered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.
You didn’t know what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very
tall girls?”

Soon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 71st Street. He understood that there was a
purpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the
media mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to show up in the press. In 2002, he flew
Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being
written about. In 2003, he becarne a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was
involved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his
office at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His
literal office is where Bennett Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at
all. It’s almost European. It’s old-—-old-fashioned, unrebabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the
trading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throwback, a
bunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and
a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s
going on here?’ and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”

Epstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting attention. One
friend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural
forces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory
of the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief battened onto a rich man because he was not living
in a box like everyone else.

The dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knowing it—in March 2005. That was
when a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,
said that she believed her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The
stepmother had learned about the matter in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an
“involuntary-admitted juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shown up at
the school with $300 in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a

call from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.
The girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic
Intracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of
who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came im,
naked but for a towel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he
touched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.

Next: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.

The lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear how police connected gray-haired Jeff with
Jeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw
themselves into an investigation of the modern and palatial house on El Brillo Way.

Palm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for towering ficus privacy hedges on
Mediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the
police did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,
where, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The 14-
year-old was used to set up her 18-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once
and thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $200 a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.
The police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer
parks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,
who said they could make $200 by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her
the younger the better-—which she said meant 18 to 20, The rules were simple. Tel! him you're 18.
There might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A
couple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 50 times,
another hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old
beauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in
Yugoslavia.

Epstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto
Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of
the sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the
statue of the man with a bow. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an
eye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac
Escalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,
through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York
decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized
a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-
shaped soaps.

Those soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t
hiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and
basic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have
been prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgrown it.
You can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not allowed. It may be allowed if you're
secretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an
achievement to Jeffrey.”

Some girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who
allegedly kept the Rolodex—seern to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love
with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were matter-of-
fact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.

But generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein
was the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was
very uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,
and Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They
didn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what

Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they
talked to police, one hysterically, One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “powerful” and was
afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in
which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to
model the underwear he’d bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was
so upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship
with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”

Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly
and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom
was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with
sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like
Hugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge porn is
men with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,
and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,
Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and
Coeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that
his activities would result in a police investigation.

His claim that he’d given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The
massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily
massages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities
preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue
masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy
endings.

Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.

The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The
law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls
might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein
wouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying
that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered
whatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told
police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could
happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of
roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.

“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he
was talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like
young women.’

Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law
professor, provided the police and the state attorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims
gleaned from their MySpace sites—showing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police
complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to
appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say,
“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”

By then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the

waterway to the Palm Beach County state attorney's office, but the state attorney apparently saw the
main witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on
MySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous
felony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they
heard that the state attorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and
sending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state attorney of
bending over backward for a rich man and then tured the matter over to the FBI.

Finally, in July 2006, the Palm Beach County state attorney's office handed down one indictment of
Epstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.
Reiter was enraged. He released a letter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that
justice has been sufficiently served.”

Epstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.
Attorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the
former Clinton prosecutor.

One of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm
Beach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion
of Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the
public fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems
stuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I
asked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple
Emanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strong!y doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,
shape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.
And there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues
from opening. There are now four on the little island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast

%

founder Danny Abraham. José Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half out, 4 loy

sources on the island are Jewish socialites.” (\Q . eeleeporS Nol at CLLL w+

Lambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have tol

Maybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big ap

charitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershowitz and Rubenstein are also major,

Israel supporters. Dershowitz has written a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Now throw

Of course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from _}@ WI! Ju
Edgar Allan Poe’s psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth’s sociological comedies. Epstein is a
hcensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shower on the first floor was

given over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had

a Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Now he was licensed

in the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.

Notwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and
joyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the
sensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.

Next: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong.

The police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had
had a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the
daughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died
mysteriously off his yacht in 1991. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father
and that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas
says he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,
and the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was
five years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never showed up in all the surveillance,
only her stationery.

Epstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told
police that toward the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to
wash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,
said that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scattered on the floor. oy ees yom get -

No need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four Nl

The U.S. attorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would
be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein
will not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state attorney on the prostitution charge.

Not that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the
air that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endowed him with utter
shamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the
moral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the
social contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this matter, he has a
philosophical position.

“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich
get richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this
whole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more
successful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater
the discrepancy actually is.”

There is no better place to observe how Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of
life are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from
Bulgan and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls
came from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,
and pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.
An attractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams
it. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”

Driving home with their $500, Haley said to the 14-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d
be rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest
stories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,
said she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation
with him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm
Beach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.

“In my mind, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, when this is over you’re getting so much money.”

José Lambiet says the case went forward in Palm Beach despite the efforts of the dream team because of
community rage arising from the class issues in the case—Epstein found the girls not from his own
fancy neighborhood but from the struggling suburbs.

He has never shown a glimmer of understanding that a high-school girl could be damaged by a powerful

50-year-old’s demands, or that some of the girls were already emotionally damaged. For someone who
could dream anything, it seems a little small.

n Manhattan’s
Upper Eagt Side, home to some of the
most expensive real estate on earth, exists
the crown jewel of the city’s residential
town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door,
huge arched windows, and nine floors, it
sits on—or. rather. commands—the block
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro-
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors, it seems more like an institution than
a house. This is perhaps not surprising—
until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan’s
largest private residence.

Inside. amid the flurry of menservants
attired in sober black suits and pristine
white gloves. you feel you have stumbled
into someone’s private Xanadu. This is
no mere rich person's home, but a high-
walled. eclectic. imperious fantasy that
seems to have no boundaries.

The entrance hall is decorated not with
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eveballs: these. the owner
tells people with relish, were imported from
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer,
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any
case. guests are like pygmies next to the
nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked
African warrior.

Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal. the statement of someone
who wants to be known for the scale of his
possessions. Its occupant. financier Jeffrey
Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren,
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered
face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts,
and loafers. He tells people he bought the
house because he knew he “could never live
anywhere bigger.” He thinks 51,000 square
feet is an appropmiately large space for some-
one like himself, who deals mostly in large
concepts—especially large sums of money.

Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at
the town house—Epstein usually refers to the
former as “tea,” since he likes to eat bite-
size morsels and drink copious quantities of
Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or to-
bacco.) Tea is served in the “leather room,”
so called because of the cordovan-colored
fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered
in a leopard print. and on the wall hangs a
huge, Oriental fantasv of a woman holding
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling li-
onskin. Under her gaze. plates of finger
sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and
guests by the menservants in white gloves.

Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the “office.” an enormous gallery
spanning the width of the house. Strangely,
it holds no computer. Computers belong in
the “computer room” (a smaller room at
the back of the house). Epstein has been
known to say. The office features a gilded
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged
to banker J. P Morgan). [8th-century black

foot ebony Steinway ~D™ grand. On the
desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de

ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop
the grand piano. “No decorator would ever
tell you to do that.” Epstein brags to visi-
tors. “But I want people to think what it
means to stuff a dog.” People can't help
but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saving that he
always has the last word.

In addition to the town house, Epstein
lives in what is reputed to be the largest
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an $18
million. 7.500-acre ranch which he named
“Zorro.” “It makes the town house look like
a shack.” Epstein has said. He also owns
Little St. James. a 70-acre island in the
US. Virgin Islands. where the main house
is currently being renovated by Edward Tut-
tle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is
also a $6.8 million house tn Palm Beach,

the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely
and calculating, giving some hint at the
steady whir of machinery running behind
them. “Let’s play chess,” he said to me, af-
ter refusing to give an interview for this arti-
cle. “You be white. You get the first move.”
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man
who seems to feel he can win no matter
what the advantage of the other side. His
advantage is that no one really seems to
know him or his history completely or what
his arsenal actually consists of. He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one
of the few truly baffling mysteries among
New York’s moneyed world. People know
snippets, but few know the whole.

“He’s very enigmatic.” says Rosa Monck-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in
the U.K. and a close frend since the early
1980s. “You think you know him and then
you peel off another ring of the onion skin
and there’s something else extraordinary
underneath. He never reveals his hand... .
He’s a classic iceberg. What vou see is not
what you get.”

ven acquaintances sense a
curious dichotomy: Yes. he
lives like a “modern ma-
haraja.” as Leah Kleman,
one of his art dealers. puts
it. Yet he is fastidiously, al-
most obsessively private—he
lists himself in the phone book under a
pseudonym. He rarely attends society gath-
erings or weddings or funerals: he considers
eating in restaurants like “eating on the sub-
way”—i.e., something he'd never do. There
are many women in his life. mostly voung,
but there is no one of them to whom he
has been able to commit. He describes his
most public companion of the last decade,
Ghislaine Maxwell. 41. the daughter of the
late, disgraced media baron Robert Max-
well, as simply his “best friend.” He says
she is not on his payroll, but she seems
to organize much of his life—recently she
was making telephone inquiries to find a

LISA HINGE

personality Donald Trump—sometimes
seem not all that clear as to what he ac-
tually does to earn his millions. Certainly,
you won't find Epstein’s transactions writ-
ten about on Bloomberg or talked about in
the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t
seem to know him. It’s unusual for animals
that big not to leave any footprints in the
snow,” says a high-level investment manager.

Unlike such fund managers as George
Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose
client lists and stock maneuverings act as
their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his
deals and clients secret, bar one client: bil-
lionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chair-
man of Limited Brands. Epstein insists that
ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he
has managed money only for billionaires—
who depend on him for discretion. “I was
the only person crazy enough, or
arrogant enough. or misplaced
enough, to make my limit a bil-
lion dollars or more,” he tells peo-
ple freely. According to him, the
flat fees he receives from his clients.
combined with his skill at playing iia
the currency markets “with very
large sums of money,” have afforded
him the lifestyle he enjoys today.

Why do billionaires choose him
as their trustee? Because the prob-
lems of the mega-rich. he tells peo-
ple. are different from yours and
mine. and his unique philosophy is
central to understanding those problems:
“Verv few people need any more money
when they have a billion dollars. The key
is not to have it do harm more than any-
thing else.... You don’t want to lose your
money.”

e has likened his job to
that of an architect—more
specifically, one who spe-
cializes in remodeling: “I
always describe [a billion-
aire] as someone who
started out in a small
home and as he became wealthier had add-
ons. He added on another addition, he built
a room over the garage ... until you have a
house that is usually a mess. ... It’s a large
house that has been put together over time
where no one could foretell the financial fu-
ture and their accompanying needs.”

He makes it sound as though his job
combines the roles of real-estate agent, ac-
countant, lawyer, money manager, trustee,
and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby,
myths and rumor swirl around Epstein.

Here are some of the hard facts about
Epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people
knowing: _He-gréw-up- middle-class in

Brooklyn's Lafayette High
School. He was good at
mathematics, and in his
early 20s he got a job teaching physics and
math at Dalton. the elite Manhattan pri-
vate school. While there he began tutoring
the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace
Greenberg and was friendly with a daugh-
ter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear

Stearns, where. under the mentorship of

both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns
C.E.O. James Cayne,. he did well enough
to become a limited partner—a rung be-
neath full partner. He abruptly departed in
1981 because. he has said, he wanted to
run his own business.

Thereafter the details recede into shad-
ow. A few of the handful of current friends
who have known him since the early 1980s
recall that he used to tell them he was a

thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand
of a man named “Andrew” in Epstein’s

Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit
in the back of Dershowitz’s law class.

Epstein gets annoyed when anyone sug-
gests that Wexner “made him.” “I had real-
ly rich clients before.” he has said. Yet he
does not deny that he and Wexner have a
special relationship. Epstein sees it as a
partnership of equals. “People have said it’s
like we have one brain between two of us:
each has a side.”

“I think we both possess the skill of

hate me, not the client.”

being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.”
One reporter, in fact, received three threats
from Epstein while preparing a piece. They
were delivered in a jocular tone, but the
message was clear: There will be trouble
for your family if I don’t like the article.
On the other hand, Epstein is clearly
very generous with frends. Joe Pagano, an
Aspen-based venture capitalist, who has
known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns
days, can't say enough nice things: “I have
a boy who’s dyslexic. and Jeffrey’s gotten
close to him over the years.... Jeffrey got
him into music. He bought him his first
piano. And then as he got to school he had
difficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got
him interested in taking flying lessons.”
Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling
her that her, daughter. Domenica, who suf-
fers from Down syndrome. needed the sun,
and that Rosa should feel free to bring her
to his house in Palm Beach anytime.
Some friends remember that in the late
80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the air-
line tickets of good trends by affixing first-
class stickers: the only problem was that the
stickers turned out to be unofficial. Some-
umes the technique worked. but other times
it didn't. and the unwitting recipients found
themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has
claimed that he paid tor the upgrades, and
had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of
those who benefited trom Epstein’s largesse
claim that his generosity comes with no
strings attached. “I never felt he wanted
anything from me in return.” says one old
friend. who received a first-class upgrade.

psiein is known about town
as a man who loves wom-
en—lots of them. mostly
young. Model types have
been heard saving they are
full of gratitude to Epstein
for flying them around. and
he is a familiar face to many of the Victo-
ria’s Secret girls. One voung woman recalls
being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to
a concert at Epstein’s town house. where
the women seemed to outnumber the men
by far. “These were not women you'd see
at Upper East Side dinners.” the woman
recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed
a little bizarrely.” This same guest also at-
tended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell
that Prince Andrew attended, which was
filled. she says, with young Russian mod-
els. “Some of the guests were horrified.”
the woman says.

“He’s reckless,” says a former business
associate, “and he’s gotten more so. Mon-
ey does that to you. He’s breaking the oath
he made to himself—that he would never
do anything that would expose him in the

M *07/96/17° °°

media. Right now, in the wake of the pub-
licity following his trip with Clinton, he
must be in a very difficult place.”

ccording to S.E.C. and
other legal documents un-
earthed by Vanity Fair,
Epstein may have good
reason to keep his past
cloaked in secrecy: his real
mentor. it might seem. was
not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffen-
berg, 57, who, for a few months before the
S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993. was
trying to buy the New York Post. He is cur-
rently incarcerated in the Federal Medical
Center in Devens. Massachusetts. serving a
20-vear sentence for bilking investors out of
more than $450 million in one of the largest
Ponzi schemes in American history.

When Epstein met Hoffenberg in Lon-
don in the 1980s. the latter was the char-
ismatic, audacious head of the Towers
Financial Corporation. a collection agency
that was supposed to buy debts that peo-
ple owed to hospitals. banks. and phone
companies. But Hoffenberg began using
company funds to pav off earlier investors
and service a lavish lifestvle that included a
mansion on Long Island. homes on Man-
hattan’s Sutton Place and in Florida. and a
fleet of cars and planes.

Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in
common. Both were smart and obsessed
with making money, Both were from Brook-
lyn. According to Holfenberg. the two men
were introduced by Douglas Leese. a de-
fense contractor. Epstein has said they were
introduced by John Mitchell. the late attor-
ney general.

Epstein had been running International
Assets Group Ine. (LA.G.). a consulting
company. out of his apartment in the Solo
building on East 66th Street in New York.
Though he has claimed that he managed
money for billionaires only, in a [989 dep-
osition he testified that he spent Sv per-
cent of his ume helping people recover
stolen money from fraudulent brokers and
lawyers. He was also not above entering
into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals
with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that
Michael Stroll, the former head of Wil-
liams Electronics Inc.. filed against Epstein
shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an in-
vestment from Stroll of $450,000. which
Epstein put into oil. In 1984, Stroll asked
for his money back: four years later he had
received only $10.000. Stroll lost the suit,
after Epstein claimed in court, among oth-
er things, that the check for $10,000 was for
a horse he'd bought from Stroll. “My net
worth never exceeded four and a half mil-
lion dollars.” Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, “really
liked Jeffrey. ... Jeffrey has a way of getting
under your skin, and he was under Hof-
fenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg
were Epstein’s social connections; they in-
cluded oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the
designer Vera) and Mohan Murjani, whose
clothing company grew into Gloria Van-
derbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even then.
One fnend recalls that when he took Cana-
dian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he
hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the oc-
casion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)

In 1987, Hoffenberg. according to sources.
set Epstein up in the offices he still occu-
pies in the Villard House. on Madison Av-
enue. across a courtyard from the restaurant
Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new pro-
tégé as a consultant at $25.000 a month.
and the relationship flourished. “They trav-
eled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s
plane. all around the world, they were al-
ways together,” savs a source. Hoffenberg
has claimed that Epstein confided in him.
saying. for example. that he had left Bear
Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered ex-
ecuting “illegal operations.”

Several of Epsteins bear Steams contem-
poranes recall that Epsiein lett the compa-
ny very suddenly. Within the company there
were rumors also that he was involved in a
technical infringement. and it was thought
that the executive committee asked that he
resign after his two supporters. Ace Green-
berg and Jimmy Cayne. were outnumbered.
Greenberg says he cant recall this: Cayne
denies it happened. and Epstein has de-
nied it as well. “Jeftre: Epstein left Bear
Stearns of his own volition.” says Cayne.
“[t was never suggested that he leave by
any member of management. and manage-
ment never looked into any improprieties
by him. Jeffrey said specifically. “I don't
want to work for anybody else. [ want to
work for myself” Yet. this is not the story
that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and
to lawvers in a [989 deposition involving a
civil business case in Philadelphia.

In 1981 the S.E.C.s Jonathan Harris and
Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony
and that of other Bear Stearns employees in
part of what became a protracted case
about insider trading around a tender offer
placed on March II, 1981. by the Seagram
Company Lu! for St. Joe Minerals Corp.
Ultimately several Italian and Swiss in-
vestors were found guilty. including Italian
financier Giuseppe Tome. who had used
his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about
the tender offer.

After the tender offer was announced,

contains a parody of Affleck and Matt Da-
mon making Good Will Hunting I, Affleck
says to Damon, “What do I keep telling you?
You gotta do the safe picture, then you do
the art picture. Then sometimes you gotta
do the payback picture because your friend
says you owe him. Then sometimes you got-
ta go back to the well.”

“Sometimes you do Reindeer Games,”
Damon says derisively.

“That's just mean,” Affleck whines.

But it’s a pretty accurate description of
his career to date. “Ben takes these franchise
properties so he can go and experiment,”
says Harvey Weinstein.

“He believes in trying to stretch himself
and not/keep doing the same thing,” ob-
serves Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck
in Armageddon. “He's an awesome actor,
and [ think he’s going to do great things.”

Several years ago, in a televised interview
on Inside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that
his goal was to make big commercial movies.
He has since revised his ambitions. “That’s
an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd
rather be in movies like Magnolia, which I
think is a towering achievement. I’ll con-
tinue to act. but [ won't act in a way that
requires me to hang my name out there
and do a lot of publicity. [ll do character
roles and focus on writing and directing. It
doesn't require the same kinds of sacri-
fice. in terms of quality of life and person-
al life. and it’s a more holistic approach to
the process. It’s become increasingly frus-
trating for me to have my role in the story-
telling process limited to one character. You
have to be respectful and judicious about

your input when it’s somebody else’s project.”

Affleck has always impressed colleagues
with his voracious appetite for information
and skills. “He has made it a point to learn
everything he can about how the business
works—not just the craft of acting, but
from the producing standpoint, from the
studio standpoint,” says Jon Gordon, exec-
utive vice president of production at Mira-
max. “He knows how deals work. It’s what
sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio
at some point, he could. He’s about as
sharp as they come.”

fleck is already juggling his acting with

screenwriting and such other commit-
ments as Project Greenlight. the contest he
and Damon started to help launch the ca-
reers of young filmmakers. Affleck’s friends
are certain he'll be directing soon. “There’s
no question.” Weinstein says. “Both he and
Matt. I think thev’re going to rewrite the
rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll
be home runs in both instances.”

But there are other thoughts tickling the
back of Affleck’s mind as well. A passion-
ate liberal, he campaigned for Al Gore,
cares deeply about pelitical issues. and Is
extremely well informed. He entertains him-
self by writing imaginary political speeches
in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS
in Africa than his movie career.

Jeltrey Epstein

CONTINUED FROM sos Bear Stearns
and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear
Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped
off that Epstein had information on insider
trading at Bear Stearns. and it was therefore
obliged to question him. In his $.E.C. testi-
mony, given on April |. 1981, Epstein claimed
that he had found “offensive” the way Bear
Stearns management had handled a disci-
plinary action following its discovery that he
had committed a possible “Reg D” viola-
tion—evidently he had lent money to his clos-
est friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said
that he'd lent approximately $20.000 to War-
ren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action
could have been considered improper, al-
though Epstein claimed he had not realized
this until afterward.

According to Epstein, Bear Stearns man-
agement had questioned him about the loan
around March 4. The questioners, Epstein
said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and

PAGE

MARCH 2003

Alvin Einbender. In his 1989 deposition Ep-
stein recalled that the partner who had made
an “issue” of the matter was Marvin David-
son. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met
with Tarnopol and Einbender again. and the
two partners told him that the executive com-
mittee had weighed the offense. together with
previous “carelessness” over expenses. and
he would be fined $2.300,

“There was discussion whether, in fact, I
had ever put in an airline ucket for some-
one else and not mvself and [ said that it
was possible, ... since my secretary han-
dles my expenses.” Epstein told the S.E.C.
In his 1989 testimony he stated that the
“Reg D” incident had cost him a shot at
partnership that vear.

What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially
interested in was whether there was a con-
nection between Epstein’s leaving and the
alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals
by other people at Bear Stearns:

Q: Sir. are vou aware that certain rumors may
have been circulating around your firm in con-

Page 36 of 151

So Is Affleck planning to pecome the lib-
crals’ answer to Ronald Reagan’ He admits
that he entertains the thought or someday
running for Congress, at least: “I think there's
a real nobility to public service. It would be
fun to run on a platform I really bel. ¢d
in, without any of the kind of compron. <S
people make—without being beholden
the win-at-all-costs mentality.”

And the invasion of privacy would be
nothing new. “What are you going to say
about me that hasn’t already been said? |
don't cheat, I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs.
I live a clean life.” Affleck says, his eves
twinkling. .

“He's only 30 years old.” says Jennifer
Todd. who co-produced Boiler Room. “He
still has an enormous amount of time to
do things.”

Time, and drive. “[ think he’s incredibly
hungry.” savs Sean Bailev. who founded
the media and production company Live-
Planet with Affleck. Damon, and Chris
Moore. “I think the guy has very grand
aspirations. [| don't think he’s going to be
content with just being a movie star. He
knows he has the petential to do very big
things.”

Such ambitions could be derailed by any
number of misealcuianons. including a pri-
vate life that generates too many sensational
headlines. but Affleck has a clear idea of
the ultimate goal. “On my deathbed. I have
to be one who looks back and feels I lived
a good and substantial and meaningful
life.” he says.

In the meantime. howe: zy. there's a wed-
ding to plan

Q: What were the rumors vou heard?

A: Nothing to do with St. Joe.

A: No.

Despite the circumstances of Epstein’s
leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his
annual bonus—which he anticipated as be-
ing approximately $ 100.000.

The S.E.C. never brought any charges
against anvone at Bear Stearns for insider
trading in St. Joe. but its questioning seems
to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein’s
answers. Some sources have wondered
why, if he was such a big producer at Bear
Stearns. he would have given it up over a
mere $2,500 fine.

Certainly the vears after Epstein left the
firm were not obviously prosperous ones.
His luck didn't seem to change until he met
Hoffenberg.

ne of Epstein’s first assignments tor Hof-

fenberg was to mastermind doomed bids
to take over Pan American World Airways in
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988.
Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before
a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up
with the idea of financing these bids through
Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois
insurance companies, Associated Life and
United Fire. “He was hired by us to work on
the securities side of the insurance companies
and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a
profit for us and for the companies.” Hoffen-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also
alleged that Epstein was the “technician.” ex-

ecuting the schemes, although, having no
broker’s license, he had to rely on others to
make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg’s sub-
sequent testimony in his criminal case has
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed
he was merely asked how the bids could be
accomplished and has said he had nothing
to do with the financing of them. Yet Rich-
ard Allen, the former treasurer of United
Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three
times at the company. He and another ex-
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finances. And in his deposition
of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one
who executed “all” Hoffenberg’s instructions
to buy and sell the stock. He called it “mak-
ing the orders.” He could not recall whether
he had chosen the brokers used.

To win approval from the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Towers’s acquisition of
the companies. Hotfenberg promised to in-
ject $3 million of new capital into them. In
fact. in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg
claimed that he. his chief operating officer.
Mitchell Brater. and Epstein came up with a
scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance
companies’ bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock. “Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater
arranged the various brokerage accounts for
the bonds to be placed with in New York,
and I think one in Chicago. Rodman & Ren-
shaw.” Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then.
said Hoffenberg. while making it appear as
though they were investing the bonds in
much safer financial instruments. they used
them as collateral to buv the stock. “Ep-
stein was the person in charge of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Brater was assisti
him with it in coordination on behalf of the
insurance companies’ money.” Hertenberg
claimed at the time.

At one point. according to Hoffenberg. a
broker forged the documents necessary for a
$L8 million check to be wntten on insurance-
company funds. The check was used to buy
more stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to throw the insurance regula-
tors off. the $1.8 milion was reported as being
safely invested in a money-market account.

United Fire's former chief financial officer
Daniel Payton confirms part of Hotlenberg’s
account. He says he recalls making one or
two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffen-
berg’s direction) about the missing bonds.
“He said. “Oh. yeah. they still exist. But we
found out later that he had sold those assets
... leveraged them ... [and] used some mar-
gin account to take some positions in...
Emery and Pan Am.” says Payton.

Epstein’s extraordinary creativity was, ac-
cording to Hoffenberg. responsible for the
purchase by the insurance companies of a
$500.000 bond, with no money down. “Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a
$500.000 treasury bond that would not be
shown ... fas] margined or collateralized”

he reportedly told the grand jury. “It looked
like it was free and clear but it actually
wasn't,” he said.

Epstein has denied he ever had any deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls
talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg’s direction
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve
the missing bonds for a state examination.
According to Allen, Epstein said, “We'll get
them back.” He had “kind of a flippant atti-
tude.” says Allen. “They never came back.”

pstein. according to Hoffenberg. also

came up with a scheme to manipulate
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at-
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred
when Hoftfenberg’s bid went wrong and the
share price began to fall. This was alleged to
have involved multiple clients’ accounts con-
trolled by Epstein.

Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in
Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case.
and Epstein. who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of any
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who
was handling the suit for the regulators. says
of Epstein. “He was very elusive. ... It was
hard to really track him down. There were a
substantial number of checks for signineant
dollars that were paid to him, I remem-
ber.... He was this character we never got a
handle on. Again we presumed that he was
involved with the Pan Am and Emery run
that Hoffenberg made. but we never got a
chance to depose him.”

“From the government’s discovery in the
main sentencing against Hotfenberg it would
seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy”
savs David Lewis. who represented Mitchell
Brater. “They went for what they knew they
could get... and that was the fraudulent
promissory notes [i.e.. the much larger and
unrelated part of Hoffenberg’s fraud. based
in New York State].... What they couldn't
get. they didn't bother with.”

Another lawyer involved in the criminal
prosecution ot Hollenberg says. “In a erim-
inal investigation like that. when there is a
guilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it.
discovery is always incomplete.... They
don't have to line up witnesses: they don't
have to learn every fact that might come out
on cross-examination.”

E pstein was involved with Hotfenberg in
other questionable transactions. Finan-
cial records show that in [988 Epstein in-
vested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a
company that manufactures football helmets.
Among his co-investors were the theater
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney
Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this
transaction claims that Epstein told Neder-
lander and Toborolf that he had raised his
share of the money from a Swiss banker,

whose identity they could not be allowed to
know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the mon-
ey came from him, and Towers’s financial
statements for that year show a loan to Ep-
stein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he
can’t remember the details and has dis-
puted the accuracy of the Towers financial
reports. )

Around the same time, Nederlander and
Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a
Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan
was to group together with two other parties
to take a substantial declared position in the
stock. According to a source, Epstein was
supposed th help Nederlander and Toboroff
raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to find
uther investors, say those familiar with the
deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an in-
vestor.) He invested $1 million, which he
told his co-investors was his own money.
But in his 1989 deposi-
tion he said that he put
in only $300.000 of his
own money. Where did
the rest come from? Hof-
fenberg has said it came
from him. in a loan that
Nederlander and Toborotf
didn't know about.

Two things happened
that alarmed Nederlander
and Toboroff. After the
group signaled a possible
takeover. the Pennwalt
management threatened to
sue the would-be raiders.
Epstein was reluctant ini-
ually to give a deposition
about his share of the
money. telling Toboroff
there were “reasons” he
didn't want to. Then. after the opportunity
for new investors was closed. co-investors
recall Epstein announcing that hed found
one at last: Dick Snyder. then C.E.O. of
the publisher Simon & Schuster. who want-
ed to put up approximately $500,000. (Nei-
ther Epstein nor Snyder can now recall
the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition
Epstein said that he had recruited Sny-
der, whom he had met socially, into the
deal.)

According to a source, Toboroff and Ne-
derlander told Epstein that Snyder was too
late. but. without their realizing it. Hotfen-
berg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to
Hotfenberg and bought out some ot his in-
vestment. But then Snyder wanted out.

“Nederlander started to get these irate
calls from [Snyder,] who wasn’t part of the
deal, saying he was owed all this money,”
says someone close to the deal. Toborotf
avi Nederlander were baffled.

ually, a source close to Hoffenberg
S 07/26/1.7enberg paid Snyder off.

ust as Nederlander and Toboroff were
J growing wary of Epstein, he became in-
creasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom
he had met through insurance executive
Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has
told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in
Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence
by persuading him not to invest in the stock
market, just as the 1987 crash was approach-
ing. His story has subsequently changed.
When asked if Wexner knew about his con-
nection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he
began working for Wexner in 1989, and that
“it was certainly not the same time.”

Wherever and whenever it was that Ep-
stein and Wexner actually met. there was
an immediate and strong personal chem-
istry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is “very
smart with a combination of excellent judg-
ment and unusually high standards. Also,
he is always a most loval friend.”

OFFICE SPACE
The “office” in Epstein’s house. It has no
computers, but it does have a desk that
Epstein tells people once belonged to banker
J. P. Morgan, and “the largest Persian rug
youll ever see in a private home.”

Sources say Epstein proved that he could
be useful to Wexner as well, with “fresh”
ideas about investments. “Wexner had a cou-
ple of bad investments. and Jeffrey cleaned
those up right away.” says a former associ-
ate of Epstein’s.

Before he signed on with Wexner. Epstein
had several meetings with Harold Levin. then
head of Wexner Investments. in which he
enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin
found incomprehensible. “In fact.” says some-
one who used to work very closely with Wex-
ner. “almost everyone at the Limited won-
dered who Epstein was: he literally came
out of nowhere.”

“Everyone was mystified as to what his
appeal was.” says Robert Morosky. a former
vice-chairnPagel3&oflistiied

uch of Epstein’s work is related to clean-

ing up, tightening budgets, and efficien-
cies. One person who worked for Wexner and
who saw a contract drawn up between the
two men says Epstein is involved in “every-
thing, not just a little here. a little there.
Everything!” In addition, he says. “Wexner
likes having a hatchet man.,.. Whenever
there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jef-
frey on it.... He has a reputation for being
ruthless but he gets the job done.”

Epstein has evidently been asked to fire
personal-staff members when needed. “He
was that mysterious person that everyone was
scared to death of.” savs a former emplovee.

Meanwhile. he is also less than popular
with some people outside Wexner’s company
with whom he now deals. “He ‘inserted’
himself into the construction process of Les-
lie Wexner’s vacht.... That resulted in liti-
gation down the road between Mr. Wexner
and the shipyard that
eventually built the ves-
sel.” savs Lars Forsberg.
a lawyer whose firm at
he time. Dickerson and
. was hired to deal
with titigation stemming
from the construction
of Wexner’s Liniiless
at 315 feet. one of the
largest private yachts in
the world. Evidently. Ep-
stein stalled on paving

ts werk “Its” probably
onee or twice in my le-
gal career that I've had
tO sue a client for payment
of services that hed re-
quested and wed per-
formed ... without issue
on the performance.” says Forsberg. In
the end the matter was settled. but Ep-
stein claims he now has no recollection
of it

The incident is one of a number of disputes
Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are
for sums so tiny as to be baffling: for instance.
Epstein sued investinent adviser Herbert
Glass, who sold him the Palm Beach house in
1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was
owed him tor furnishings removed by Glass.

In 1998 the U.S. Attorney's Office sued
Epstein for illegally subletting the ee
home of the deputy consul general of Bee
to attorney Ivan Fisher and ogee
paid $15,000 a month " ine eae and

his colleagues $20,000. Though led

he is winning. Whether in conversations or
negotiations, he always stands back and lets
the other person determine the style and
manner of the conversation or negotiation.
And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey
sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick
a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you
choose your weapon.”

One case is rather more serious. Currently,
Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on
loans from its private-banking arm for $20
million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraud-
ulently induced” him into borrowing the
money for investments. Citibank disputes this
charge.

The legal papers for another case offer a
rare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995,
Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord.
the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his
office in the Villard House. He claimed that
they were breaking the terms of the lease by
not letting his staff in at night. The case was
eventually settled. However, one of the papers
filed in this dispute is Epstein’s financial state-
ment for 1988. in which he claimed to be
worth $20 million. He listed that he owned
$7 million in securities, $1 million in cash.
zero in residential property (although he
told sources that he had already bought the
home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in
other assets. including his investment in
Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: “The
company had been bought with a huge
amount of debt. and it wasn't public, so it
was meaningless to attach a figure like that to
it... the price it cost was about $1.2 mil-
lion.” The co-investors bought out Epstein’s
share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately
$3 million. At that time, when Epstein was
asked. as a routine matter. to sign a paper
guaranteeing he had access to a few million
dollars in case of any subsequent disputes
over the sale price. Wexner signed for him.
Epstein has explained that this was because
the co-investors wanted an indemnity against
being sued by Wexner. One of the investors
calls this “bullshit.”

pstein’s appointment to the board of

New York’s Rockefeller University in
2000 brought him into greater social promi-
nence. Boasting such social names as Nancy
Kissinger, Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass,
the board also includes such pre-eminent
scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Gold-
stein. “Epstein was thrilled to be elected.”
says someone who knows him.

After one term Epstein resigned. Accord-
ing to New York magazine, this was because
ne didn’t like to wear a suit to meetings. A

‘akesperson tc~ the Rockefeller board says

- Je because he had insufficient time
“9 BOM a coard member recalls that he

346 j VAM'T¥Y EAR

was “arrogant” and “not a good fit.” The
spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent”
for board members not to be renominated
after only one term.

Still, the recent spate of publicity Ep-
stein has inspired does not seem to have
fazed him. In November he was spotted in
the front row of the Victora’s Secret fashion
show at New York’s Lexington Avenue Ar-
mory; around the same ume the usual co-
terie of friends and beautiful women were
whisked off to Little St. James (which he
tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff)
for a long weekend.

Thanks to Epstein’s introductions, says
Martin Nowak. the biologist finds himself
moving from Princeton to Harvard. where
he is assuming the joint position of profes-
sor of mathematics and professor of biolo-
gy. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million
to Harvard to create the Epstein Program
for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary
Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office
at the university. The program will be dedi-
cated to searching tor nature’s algorithms. a
pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak’s. For
Epstein this mus: be the summit of every-
thing he has worked toward: he has been
seen proudly dispiaving Harvard president
Larry Summers's letter of commitment as
if he can’t quite believe it is real. He says he
was reluctant to have his name attached to
the program. but Summers persuaded him.
He rang his mentor Wexner about it. and
Wexner told him it was all night.

An insatiable. restless soul. alwavs on the
move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount
of downtime into tus hectic work schedule.
Yet there is something almost programmed
about his relaxation: it’s as if even plea-
sure has to be measured in terms of self-
improvement. Nowak says that. when he
goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean,
they Il get up at six and. as the sun rises.
have three-hour conversations about theoret-
ical physics. “Then he'll go off and do some
work. re-appear. and we'll talk some more.”

Another person who went to the island
with Epstein. Maxwell. and several beautiful
women remembers that the women “sat
around one night teasing him about the
kinds of grasping women who might want
to date him. He was amused by the idea....
He’s like a king in his own world.”

Many people comment there is some-
thing innocent. almost childlike about Jef-
frey Epstein. They see this as refreshing. given
the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan
Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to
know Epstein. his wife asked him if he would
still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed
for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied.
“Absolutely. | would be as interested in him
as a friend if we had hamburgers on the
boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about

his ideas.” =

Abstract (Document Summary)

Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000.

[Jeffrey Epstein]'s mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just
$1. Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.

SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for
man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in
flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a
new man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he
needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these
days.

"DISCO Bloodbath" author James St. James is following up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig
with another true-crime tome. He's shopping around "Killer Grandpa," his investigation into a lynching that his
grandfather led in 1935. "My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that
allegedly raped a white woman," James told us. "About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun
around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and | write about what really
happened.” James, a 1980s club kid who fell in with Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in "Party
Monster," the movie adaptation of "Disco Bloodbath.” But James said he was "shocked" when he watched a few
scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig. "| didn't know | was so gay! | thought | was
more like Steve McQueen, but Seth is flouncing around the whole time. Seth is much cuter than me, actually,
and looks better in drag."

PAGE SIX'S scoop last month that mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein had flown Bill Clinton, Chris
Tucker and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private 727 has sent journalists all over town trying to find out just who
Epstein really is.

Vanity Fair has a reporter on his trail, but New York magazine beats them to the punch with a feature this week
on Epstein's strange history.

Epstein, 49, a former Dalton School math teacher from Coney Island, is said to manage $15 billion for super-
wealthy clients he'll only take on if they have at least $1 billion in assets.

"According to people who know him," New York reports, “if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the
services of Epstein & Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you.”

Noted mergers/acquisitions lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft recalls trying to give
Epstein a client whose funds were below the $1 billion cutoff.

"| sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him," Block reports. "Said the account was
too small. Both the client and | were amazed. But that's Jeffrey."

Most Wall Streeters, however, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. "My belief is that Jeff
maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him," says one
powerful investor. "He once told me that he has 300 people working for him, and I've also heard he manages
Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz."

Some say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a
suit, supposedly telling a friend, "It feels like wearing a dress."

One power player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump.

"I've known Jeffrey for 15 years," The Donald tells the magazine. "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as | do, and many of them are on the younger side."

Another thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a
taste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,000-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 71st Street.

Epstein's mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $1.
Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.

"| don't want to live in another person's house,” Epstein told New York.

Blind dater

CHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The "Law & Order’ hunk was set up on a blind date with
Rose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at
the Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the
set of "Sex and the City." MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson.

‘Rockets’ soars

"ROCKETS Redglare!" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and downtown icon - won the Grand
Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by
Luis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets’ pals Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim
Jarmusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 350-pound former bodyguard of punk
legend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of Buscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of

drug abuse.

Bizarre union

BOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. "He treated women like the rest of the
world treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?" she told "20/20" contributing correspondent
Chris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and
videotape, Pat insists: "We had a wondertul sex life. We had a wonderful marriage." Crane was bludgeoned to
death in 1978 with a camera tripod.

Plot device

GAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel "The
Night We Met," a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Byrnes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After
making references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Byrnes even attempts to replicate one of our
items in the climax. Byrnes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does
have us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece.

Change partners

SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for
man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in
flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a
new man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he
needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these

days.

Epstein, 53, was indict-

felony solicitation of prosti-

iter’s “craziness,” one of
Epstein’s lawyers said. His

‘department disseminated

“a distorted view of the
case” and behaved in a
“childish” manner when the
grand jury didn’t indict Ep-
stein on the charges it
sought, another Epstein
lawyer complained.

Colleagues cite chief’s professionalism,

® REITER from 1B

ney’s office for two reasons.
First, he pressed for Epstein
to be charged with the more
serious crimes of sexual ac-

tivity with minors. Second, he .

slammed State Attorney Bar-
ry Krischer in blunt language
seldom used by one law-
enforcement official con-
cerning another because of
what he perceived as that of-
fice’s mishandling of the
case.

In a letter to Krischer
written May 1, Reiter called
his actions in the Epstein
case “highly unusual.” He
added, “Imusturge youto...
consider. if good ,and suffi-
cient reason exists to require
your disqualification from the
prosecution of these cases.”

In short, Reiter told the
county's top prosecutor for
the past 13 years that he
ought to get off the case. “It
looks like a departure from

professionalism,” Miami-
Dade State Attorney
Katherine Fernandez Rundle
said of Reiter’s letter.
Following Epstein’s in-
dictment, Reiter referred the
case to the FBI to determine
whether the super-rich,
super-connected defendant
had violated any federal laws.

Reiter won't discuss the
case or the broadsides aimed
at him. But others almost
uniformly use one word to
describe the chief: profes-
sional,

“T have always been im-
pressed by Mike’s profes-
sionalism and his leader-
ship,” said Rick Lincoln, chief
of the Lantana Police Depart-
ment and a Palm Beach
County cop for 32 years.

“The town of Palm Beach
has a very professional police
department. We all consider
Mike to be our peer and a
man of integrity.”

Reiter: Town
Manager Peter
Elwell says the
Palm Beach
police chief's
well worth his
$144,000 sal-

Juno Beach Police Chief
H.C. Clark II agreed. Al
though he doesn’t know Re-
iter well, he has met with him
on countywide law enforce-
ment issues. “I’ve never seen
him lose his cool. I’ve never
seen anything but a profes-
sional demeanor from him.”

Reiter joined the Palm
Beach Police Department in
1981, leaving a$20,000-a-year
patrol job at the University of
Pittsburgh. His personnel

Jeffrey Epstein - a self-proclaimed billionaire who hobnobs with moguls and pledged $25 million to Harvard - is
actually a small potatoes ex-bounty hunter with a questionable financial background, says a report.

Epstein, a 50-year-old Ralph Lauren lookalike who claims to manage a billionaires-only fund, has made
headlines for his high- society lifestyle; among his attention-grabbing moves was flying President Clinton and
Kevin Spacey to Africa on a private jet.

But a report in the March issue of Vanity Fair, on newsstands this week, unmasks Epstein’s mystery image.

Epstein wasn't exactly the top gun at Bear Stearns, as he claims - and left the firm amid a swirl of rumors and an
SEC violation, the article said.

His mentor in high finance was Steve Hoffenberg, the bill collector turned hustler now serving 20 years in prison
for running the nation's costliest Ponzi scheme, the report says.

The article says that when Epstein worked for Hoffenberg, he cooked up some of Hoffenberg's questionable
financing deals - a claim Epstein has denied.

Epstein has also been involved in numerous lawsuits, including one in which Citibank is suing him for defaulting
on $20 million in loans from its private banking arm.

Epstein and his lawyer, Jeffrey Schantz, couldn't be reached for comment on the article.

The article said that Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, except for one - retail magnate Leslie
Wexner, who calls Epstein "smart . . . [with] high standards . . . and a loyal friend."

THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the fat and fraudulent former
owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. | hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the
Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her
relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&M-themed party.
Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set"
have recently sworn off any kind of publicity. A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid
"Bright Young Things," written by one of their own, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this crowd as a bunch of
twits living off their trust funds.

Ghislaine's own funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least
one business in New York. But Maxwell's own ill-gotten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,
which was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the
crash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to own an apartment on the
Upper East Side and a mews house in London.

She is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly
has holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of attractive young women, and it's
said that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.

Ghislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be
heavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing
were diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going down the toilet.

Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of
Mystery

He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize—winning scientists,
CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine
Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Bill
Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his

private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he
is.

By Landon Thomas Jr.

He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of
airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladies --
to say nothing of a relentless brain that
challenges Nobel Prize—winning scientists
across the country -- and for financial
markets around the world. Ever since the
Post's "Page Six" ran an item about the
president's late-September visit to Africa
with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker -- on
his new benefactor's customized Boeing
Bear’ 727 -- the question of the day has been:

: bak) es Who in the world is Jeffrey Epstein?
Cash Casual: Epstein dresses
down. (Photo credit: Courtesy of
Jeffrey Epstein)

It's a life full of question marks. Epstein is
said to run $15 billion for wealthy clients,
yet aside from Limited founder Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held
secret. A former Dalton math teacher, he maintains a peripatetic salon of
brilliant scientists yet possesses no bachelor's degree. For more than ten
years, he's been linked to Manhattan-London society figure Ghislaine
Maxwell, daughter of the mysteriously deceased media titan Robert Maxwell,
yet he lives the life of a bachelor, logging 600 hours a year in his various
planes as he scours the world for investment opportunities. He owns what is
said to be Manhattan's largest private house yet runs his business from a
100-acre private island in St. Thomas.

Power on Wall Street has generally accrued to those who have made their

open bids for it. Soros. Wasserstein. Kravis. Weill. The Sturm und Drang of
their successes and failures has been played out in public. Epstein breaks the
mold. Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to
know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way he likes it.

Everything Guide to Pearls

"My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though
you won't get a straight answer from him," says one well-known investor. “He
once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he
manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the
Wizard of Oz -- there may be less there than meets the eye."

Says another prominent Wall Streeter: "He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque
figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of
aloofness. The whole thing is weird."

The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully
coiffed head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A
raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour
and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal
instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. He is an enthusiastic
member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.

He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is
rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his
board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. "It
feels like a dress," he told one friend.

Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched
alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you
talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen
years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He's a lot of fun to
be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as | do, and
many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his
social life."

But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about
Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in
people -- be it politics or science. It's what | do," he has said to friends. And
his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a

species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be
up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the
rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,
"If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike
Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign
leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest
politician."

“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist
with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-
first-century science," Clinton says through a spokesman. "I especially
appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work
on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating
HIV/AIDS."

Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to
be speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.
While they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell
has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons
Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. "It's a mysterious relationship that they
have," says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. "In one way, they are
soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional
relationship, where they serve each other's purposes."

Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-
octane than Epstein’s, lent a little pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed,
at a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see
Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-
educated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own
helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison
Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently
seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no
boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social
columns, but there is much more to him than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of
the private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. "He's a talented money manager
and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,
though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-
promoter."

Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High
School. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper
Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU's
Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the
heart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975,
Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.

By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets
Society type of figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate
mathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that
he said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?
You should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace
Greenberg a call."

The Wexner War
August 1, 2003

We can only imagine Limited founder and apparel mag- nate Leslie Wexner’s
consternation over the leaking of a document entitled, Wexner Analysis: Israeli
Communication Priorities 2003. The report was prepared for the Wexner Foundation and
provides insight into Wexner’s relationship with the state of Israel. As the Cleveland
Plain Dealer noted, Wexner keeps his personal life “under padlock.” But what has
surfaced over the years simply adds to his mystery. In the Shapiro murder file,
personally ordered destroyed by Columbus Chief of Police James Jackson, Wexner is
listed as an alleged organized crime associate. A December 1995 Architectural Digest
article and a follow-up 1996 New York Times report detailed the inner sanctum of
Wexner’s former Manhattan townhouse, one of the largest in the city.

“Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a
stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit
television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink,” wrote
the Times. The townhouse is now reportedly owned by Wexner’s even more mysterious
protégé, Jeffrey E. Epstein.

Epstein, who recently loaned his jet to President Clinton, is usually seen in the company
of Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of deceased publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. After
Maxwell fell or was pushed off his yacht in 1991, it was revealed that he was working for
the Israeli government and the Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence service. While Maxwell's
ties to the Mossad are well-documented, Epstein’s connections are less well known. The
London Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follows:
“He’s Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he’s a concert pianist, property developer, a
CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad.” New York Magazine claims Epstein
is the man who moves Wexner’s billions around the globe.

Wexner’s philanthropic side is more public. In 1998, the Wall Street Journal reported
that Wexner was part of the ““Mega Group,’ a loosely organized club of 20 of the nation’s
wealthiest and most influential Jewish businessmen.” The Mega Group meets
purportedly to discuss “philanthropy,” but others have speculated that their charitable
interests are often a cover for lobbying activities on behalf of Israel. The Wall Street
Journal identified Max Fisher, a Detroit financier and billionaire, as a member of the
Mega Group. Fisher was used as a private Middle East diplomat by President Gerald Ford
during the 1970s and is considered Wexner’s mentor.

So, when the Wexner Analysis report was leaked, it caused a stir but no questioning of
Wexner’s little-explored relationships with Epstein and Fisher. Frank Lutz, the Republican
Party pollster and spin doctor, prepared the Wexner Analysis. Lutz’s report essentially
outlines a political PR campaign “as the post-war dust settles over the Iraqi desert.”

The Wexner Analysis points out that “. . . many sympathize with the plight of the
Palestinian people, [but] there is no love lost for Yassir Arafat.” The report complains
that, “the emergence of Mahmoud Abbas as the new Palestinian Prime Minister comes
exactly at the wrong time.”

Why? “His ascent to power seems legitimate. He is a fresh face, and a clean-shaven one

at that. He speaks well and dresses in Western garb,” the report states. Lutz’s
assessment is that “the Palestinians throw us this curve ball.”

The Free Press -- Independent News Media - Bob Fitrakis

Still, the Wexner Analysis emphasizes that “now is the time to link American success in
dealing with terrorism and dictators from a position of strength to Israel’s ongoing
efforts to eradicate terrorism on and within its borders.”

Lutz, realizing the value of an Arab bogeymen, stresses that “Saddam Hussein’ are the
two words that tie Israel to America and are most likely to deliver support in Congress.
The day we allow Saddam to take his eventual place in the trash heap of history is the
day we lose our strongest weapon in the linguistic defense of Israel.

In the “Essential Conclusion” section of the report, Lutz offers 10 recommendations. The
first is: “Iraq colors all. Saddam is your best defense, even if he is dead. For a year - a
SOLID YEAR - you should be invoking the name of Saddam Hussein and how Israel was
always behind American efforts to rid the world of this ruthless dictator and liberate their
people.”

Now, as the occupation of Iraq begins to look like the dreaded quagmire, and American
troops are dying at the rate of almost one a day, more scrutiny should come to the role
of those who pushed for the attack on Iraq, since Saddam Hussein neither had links to

Al Qaeda nor posed a threat to the United States.

The Project for the New American Century, the major ideological force behind the illegal
attack on Iraq, are generally more concerned with Hussein's threat to Israel than to the
United States. Recent reports that Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense,
advised President Bush to include the bogus reference to uranium from Niger in the
State of the Union address demonstrates a much bigger problem.

Lobbying groups like the Mega Group and government insiders like Wolfowitz and
Richard Pearle are engaged in a systematic campaign to identify Israeli national security
interests with U.S. military and security interests. The Wexner Analysis merely
documents this extensive, often covert campaign, that deserves public debate and
democratic discourse, not secret PR campaigns.

Investor facing felony sex charge

By WILLIAM KELLY
Daily News Staff Writer

Thursday, July 27, 2006

A billionaire investor and part-time Palm Beach resident has been indicted on a felony
charge of solicitation of prostitution after police say he had sex with underage girls whom
he paid for massage sessions at his El Brillo Way home.

A Palm Beach County grand jury found that Jeffrey E. Epstein, 53, "did solicit, induce,
entice or procure" prostitution with girls, who were between 14 and 16 years old, on at
least three occasions between Aug. 1, 2004, and Oct. 31, 2005.

Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,000
bond. His attorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-

degree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the
girls were minors.

The next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date
will be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-
degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

A resident of New York, Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot
waterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since 1990.

The indictment followed an 11-rmonth sexual battery investigation bo 7s Der chs oelise
that began in March 2005 alter a Woiiun told police tii ter 14-ycui-uig oiepouu gucci

The investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York
City, and on Haley Robson, 20, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by
Epstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to
Epstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor
Robson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.

Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses concerning the
massages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.

During their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone
numbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according
to police. Epstein would then pay the girls $200 or $300, police said.

----------------------------------------
Epstein is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with some of the girls on three
occasions, and paid one girl $1,000 after she objected during sex, police said.

During the investigation, police said they learned of several more young women, all 18
years old or older, who consented to the "same massage routine" when they went to work
for Epstein, according to the police report.

Police said they learned of these women by searching Epstein's trash, through
surveillance of his property and his private jet, and by reviewing telephone message
books retrieved during a warrant search of the house.

Epstein's spokesman, Sean Cassidy, said Epstein would have no comment for this story.
Cassidy and Goldberger declined to answer questions. But Goldberger said in a prepared
statement that "the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were
not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney's office questioned the
credibility of the witnesses."

The statement also said that "a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly
unsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr.
Epstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute."

Goldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph
examiner, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police
search of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls’ allegations,
Goldberger said.

Solicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-
degree felony pene sree cinitge applied when there are three or more alleged offenscs,

Janet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the departineit handed the case
to Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence.

"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an
arrest warrant with the State Attorney's Office, which we did,” Kinsella said.

But rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before
the grand jury.

Police Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he
suggested in a May | memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case. Reiter said in

letters to the alleged victims and their parents that justice was not served by the
indictment and that the case has been referred to the FBI to determine if federal laws
were violated.

Edmondson said Krischer's office reviewed the police evidence and decided to
investigate further.

"The prosecutor looks at the witnesses and physical evidence from a broader view,"
Edmondson said. "Because of the nature of the allegations, in particular the lengthy
sexual activity on part of the individuals and elements of financial reward to the
individuals, the case was referred to the grand jury. The grand jury heard from law-
enforcement officials and witnesses and reviewed all of the evidence before determining
that the appropriate charge was felony solicitation of prostitution.”

Town returned donation

Before the police investigation began, Epstein had donated $90,000 to the department for
an equipment purchase that was never made. The money was returned to Epstein on
Monday, Finance Director Jane Struder said.

Epstein has been known to date top models and was once named by the New York Post
as one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors.

His rise to wealth has been characterized by some as mysterious. Epstein was a math
teacher at Manhattan's posh Dalton School when he started handling the money of
billionaire fashion czar Leslie Wexner, who owns The Limited, Victoria's Secret, Express

Epstein's Palm Beach home was appraised for tax purposes last year at $6.9 million.

He was one of the bidders on the Abe Gosman estate on North County Road, which
eventually was sold to Donald Trump for more than $41 million in 2004.

In a March 2003 article in Vanity Fair, writer Vicky Ward described Epstein as a
charming, enigmatic and calculating financier who accepts only billionaires as clients.

WHAT THE PRESS CALLS 'EPSTEIN SEX SCANDAL' SOUNDS A BIT MORE I
— THU, JUL 27, 2006 —

Ok, we know we gave Jeffrey Epstein a minor bullet point in our little
gossip round-up. But that's because we are just now going through ‘The
Smoking Gun report on the Donald Trump role model and fellow
scumbag, who not only recently arrested for soliciting sex from a masseuse,
but who, according to "a former houseman," received three massages a day
from girls who appeared to be, at the most, sixteen or seventeen years old.
In case you haven't seen it, things get much worse.

He also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had
to "wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" which
had been left in a sink. Alfredo Rodriguez, a former house manager,
told probers that he "knew" Epstein's masseuses were still in high
school. Rodriguez also told of having to "wipe down" vibrators and sex toys post-massage and
returning them to an armoire near Epstein's bed.

It gets worse. About 22 pages of allegedly underage girls traipsing in and out of the house and engaging in various
sexual acts with Epstein worse. The affidavid from a 14 year old girl, who's name is being withheld, names Haley
Robinson and Sara Keller as two of the girls involved in this sick story. We can't get into all the details here —
we have neither the stomach nor the time to sort through the novella sized account of Epstein's alleged
escapades. What did jump out at us, however, more than the egg-shaped penis or the photos of naked underage
girls all over his house, was the part which accounts Epstein's alleged rape of a sixteen year old girl. (Yes, all sex
with a minor is rape, but this involves the girl screaming "No!" and Epstein paying her $1,000 after "forcibly
holding her down on the table.")

[Witheld] stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and having sex and
proudly display the photographs within the home. [Withheld] stated during one visit to Epstein’s
house in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend Nada Marcinkova was also
present. [Withheld] provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each other’s

breasts and kiss for Epstein to enjoy. Toward te end of this massage, Epstein grabbed [withheld]
and turned her over onto her stomach on the massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into
her vagina. [Withheld] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [Withheld] became
very upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to
pump inside of her. She screamed “No!” and Epstein stopped. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of
her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for that visit.

Umm, can you say really, really fucked up? Read the thing for yourself, if you care to, but we just felt it necessary
to point out that this story is more than lube and vibrators and massages. This is like, allegedly, really messed up
stuff. And we are more than astounded at the press for not bringing these accusations to light. Very, very
disappointing. Maybe since he's friends with Bill Clinton, Ron Burkle, and Donald Trump, accusations that
he's raping little girls can be omitted from the news.

Billionaire In Palm Beach Sex Scandal

Investigators: Moneyman Jeffrey Epstein solicited teen masseuses

JULY 26--Prepare to take a shower after reading this
remarkably sleazy probable cause affidavit filed in the
case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who was
arrested Sunday for soliciting sex from a masseuse at his
Florida mansion. Beginning in mid-March 2005, Epstein
became the target of a sexual battery probe conducted by
the Palm Beach Police Department, according to the
affidavit, which alleges that Epstein, 53, paid a series of
underage girls to engage in sexual activity with him.
Frankly, there are too many dirty details in the affidavit
to properly synopsize, but, if investigators are to be
believed, Epstein has a thing for teenagers, vibrators, and
assorted massage lotions. Epstein, pictured above in a Palm Beach County
Sheriff's Office mug shot, has been indicted on a felony solicitation of
prostitution rap. The indictment, which does not allege that the solicited
was a minor, charges that the crime occurred between August 2004 and Octob
2005. In a statement, Epstein's lawyer dismissed the affidavit's charges a
"false accusations." Jose Alessi, a former houseman, told cops that Epstei
would receive three massages daily and that his masseuses were "younger an
younger" and "appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most
also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had to "wash of

massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" which had been left in a sink.

Alfredo Rodriguez, a former house manager, told probers that he "knew" Eps
masseuses were still in high school. Rodriguez also told of having to "wip
down" vibrators and sex toys post-massage and returning them to an armoire

Jeffrey Epstein craved big homes, elite friends

and, investigators say, underage girls
By ANDREW MARRA, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

WINGED GARGOYLES guarded the gate at Jeffrey
Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Inside, hidden cameras
trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went.

For the police detectives
who sifted through the gar-
bage outside and kept
records of visitors, it was the
lair of a troubling target.

Epstein, one of the most
mysterious of the country’s
mega-rich, was known as
much for his secrecy as for
his love of fine things: mag-
nificent homes, private jets,
beautiful women, friendships
with the world’s elite.

But at Palm Beach police
headquarters, he was be-
coming known for something

else: the regular arrival of
teenage girls he hired to give
him massages and, police
say, perform sexual favors,

Epstein was different
from most sexual abuse sus-
pects; he was far more pow-
erful. He counted among his
friends former President Bill
Clinton, Donald Trump and
Prince Andrew, along with
some of the most prominent
legal, scientific and business
minds in the country.

‘> EPSTEIN from 1A

‘asking questions and teenage girls
‘started talking, a wave of legal
‘resistance followed. °

If Palm Beach police didn’t know
quite who Jeffrey Epstein was; they
found out soon enough.

Epstein, now 53, was a quintes-
sential man of mystery. He amassed
his fortune and friends quietly,
always in the background as. he
navigated New York high society.

_. When he first attracted notice in
the early 1990s, it was on account of
the woman he was dating: Ghislaine
Maxwell, daughter of the late British
media tycoon Robert Maxwell.

In a lengthy article, headlined
“The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-
well’s Secret Love,” the British Mail
on Sunday tabloid laid out specula-
tive stories that the socialite’s beau
was a CIA spook, a math teacher, a
concert pianist or a corporate head-
hunter.

“But what is the truth about
him?” the newspaper wondered.
“Like Maxwell, Epstein is both
flamboyant and intensely private.”

The media frenzy did not begin
in full until a decade later. In Sep-
tember 2002, Epstein was flung into
the limelight when he flew Clinton
and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris
Tucker to Africa on his private jet.

Suddenly everyone wanted to
know who Epstein was. New York
magazine and Vanity Fair published
lengthy profiles. The New York Post
listed him as one of the city’s most
eligible bachelors and began
describing him in its gossip columns
with adjectives such as “mysterious”
and “reclusive.”

Although Epstein gave no inter-
views, the broad strokes of his past
started.to come into focus.

Building a life of extravagance

He was born blue-collar in 1953,
the son of a New York City parks
department employee, and raised in

fuel extraordinary desires.

In March 2005, a worried mother
contacted Palm Beach police. She
said another parent had overheard a
conversation between their chil

n.

Now the mother was afraid her
14-year-old daughter had been
molested by aman on the island.

The phone call triggered an
extensive investigation, one that
would lead detectives to Epstein but
leave them frustrated.

Palm Beach police and the state
attorney's office have declined to
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach
police report detailing the criminal
probe offers a window into what
detectives faced as they sought to
close in on Epstein.

Detectives interviewed the girl,
who told them a friend had invited
her to arich man’s house to perform
a massage. She said the friend told
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the
house, she said she was paid $300
after stripping to her panties and
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated.

Police interview 5 alleged victims

The investigation began in full
after the girl identified Epstein in a
photo as the man who had paid her.
Police arranged for garbage trucks
to set aside Epstein’s trash so police
could sift through it. They set up a
video camera to record the comings
and goings at his home. They mon-
itored an airport hangar for signs of
his private jet’s arrivals and depar-
tures.

They quickly learned that the
woman who took the 14-year-old girl
to Epstein’s house was Haley Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Community Col-

——e ~—_slege student from Loxahatchee. Ina
Sythe Associated Press’ ~~swom statement at police head-

enough dirt on the girls to make
prosecutors skeptical. Not only did
some of the girls have issues with
drugs or alcohol but also some had
criminal records and other troubles,
Epstein’s legal team claimed. And at
least one of them, they said, lied
when she told police she was
younger than 18 when she started
performing massages for Epstein.

After the meeting, prosecutors
postponed their decision to take the
case to a grand jury.

In the following weeks, police
received complaints that two of the
victims or their families had been
harassed or threatened. Epstein’s
legal team maintains that its private

_ investigators did nothing illegal or

unethical during their research.

By then, relations between
police and prosecutors were fraying.
At a key meeting with prosecutors
and the defense, Detective Joseph
Recarey, the lead investigator, was a
no-show, according to Epstein’s
attorney.

“The embarrassment on the
prosecutor's face was evident when
the police officer never showed up
for the meeting,” attorney Jack
Goldberger said.

Later in April, Recarey walked
into a prosecutor's office at the state
attorney’s office and learned the
case was taking an unexpected turn.

The prosecutor, Lanna
Belohlavek, told Recarey the state
attorney's office had offered Epstein
a plea deal that would not require
him to serve jail time or receive a
felony conviction.

Recarey told her he disapproved
of the plea offer.

The deal never came to pass, .

however.

Future unclear after charge

On May 1, the department asked
prosecutors to approve warrants. to
arrest Epstein on four counts of
unlawful sexual activity with a minor
and to charge his personal assistant,
Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged
role in arranging the visits. Police

math teacher at the prestigious
Dalton School in Manhattan.

The story goes that the father of
one of Epstein’s students was so
impressed with the man that he put
him in touch with a senior partner at
Bear Stearns, the global investment
bank and securities firm.

In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a
job at Bear Stearns. By the early
1980s, he had started J. Epstein and
Co. That is when he began making’
his millions in earnest.

Little is known or said about
Epstein’s business except this: He
manages money for the extremely
wealthy. He is said to handle
accounts only of $1 billion or great-
er.

It has been estimated he has
roughly 15 clients, but their identi-
ties are the subject of only specula-
tion. All except for one: Leslie Wex-
ner, founder of The Limited retail
chain and a former Palm Beacher
who is said to have been a mentor to
Epstein.

Wexner sold Epstein one of his
most lavish residences: a massive
townhouse that dominates a block
on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It
is reported to:have, among its finer
features, closed-circuit’. television
and a heated sidewalk to melt away
fallen snow.

That townhouse, thought to be
the largest private residence in
Manhattan, is only a piece of the
extravagant world Epstein built over
time.

In New Mexico, he constructed a
27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion
ona 10,000-acre ranch outside Santa
Fe. Many believed it to be the largest
home inthe state.

In Palm Beach, he bought a
waterfront home on E! Brillo Way.
And he owns a 100-acre private
island in the Virgin Islands.

Perhaps as remarkable as his
lavish: homes is his extensive net-
work of friends and associates at the
highest echelons of power. This
includes not only socialites but also
business tycoons, media. moguls;
politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-
winning scientists whose research
he often funds.

“Just like other people collect
art, he collects scientists,” said
Martin Nowak, who: directs the
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics
at Harvard University and was
reportedly the recipient of a $30
million research donation from
Epstein. :

Epstein is said to have
befriended former Harvard Presi-
dent Larry Summers, prominent law
Professor Alan. Dershowitz, Donald
Trump and New York Datiy News
Publisher Mort Zuckerman.

And yet he managed for decades
to maintain a low profile. He avoids
eating out and was rarely photo-
graphed.

even aware of him,” except for a
Vanity Fair article.

Epstein’s friendship with Clinton
has attracted the most attention.

Epstein met Clinton as early as
1995, when he paid tens of. thou-
sands of dollars:to join him at an
intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm
Beach. But from all appearances,
they did not become close friends
until after Clinton left the Oval Office
and moved to New York.

campaigns, including John Kerry’s.

campaign of New Mexico: Gov. Bill
Richardson and the Senate bids of
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham

Powerful friends and: enemies

A Vanity Fair profile found
cracks in the veneer of Epstein’s life
story. The 2003 article said he left
Bear Stearns in the wake of a-federal
probe and a possible Securities and
Exchange Commission violation. It
also pointed out that Citibank once
sued him for defaulting on a $20
million loan.

In October, police searched the
Palm Beach mansion. They discov-

ered photos of naked, young-looking '

females, just as several of the girls
had described in interviews. Hidden
cameras were found in the garage
area and inside a clock on Epstein’s
desk, alongside a girl’s high school
transcript.

Two of Epstein’s former
employees told investigators that
young-looking girls showed up to
perform massages two or three
times a day when Epstein was in
town.

They said the girls were permit-
ted many indulgences. A chef
cooked for them. Workers gave
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time.

One employee told detectives he
was told to send a dozen roses to one
teenage girl after a high school
drama performance. Others were
given rental cars. One, according to
police, received a $200 Christmas
bonus.

The cops moved to cement their
case. But as they tried to tighten the
noose, they encountered other
forces at work.

In Orlando they interviewed a
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened
between her and Epstein. They
asked her whether she had spoken
to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-

vate investigator had asked her the -

same questions.

When they itiineenied one of
Epstein’s former employees, he told
them the same thing. He and a pri-
vate eye had met at a restaurant days
earlier to go over what the man
would tell investigators.

Detectives received complaints
that private eyes were posing as
police officers: When they told
Epstein’s oe attorney, Guy-Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked
for Roy Black,. the high-powered
Miami lawyer who has defended the
likes of Rush Limbaugh and William
Kennedy Smith.

While the private eyes were
conducting a parallel investigation,
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro-
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach

son, the selfdescribed Heidi Fleiss,
with lewd and lascivious acts.

By then, the department was
frustrated with the way the state
attorney's office had handled the
case. On the same day the warrants
were requested, Palm Beach Police
Chief Michael Reiterwrote a letter
to State Attorney Barry Krischer
suggesting he disqualify himself
from the case if he would not act.

Two weeks later, Recarey was
told that prosecutors had decided
once again to take the case to the
grand jury.

It is not known hov many of the
girls testified before he grand jury.
But Epstein’s defenseteam said one
girl who was subpoemed — the one
who said she had sexial intercourse
with Epstein — nevershowed up -

The grand jury’s indictment was
handed down in July. It was not the
one the police department had
wanted.

Instead of being slapped with a
charge of unla’ sexual activity
with a minor, Epstein was charged
with one count of felony solicitation
of prostitution, which carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison. He was booked into the Palm
Beach County Jail early July 23 and
released hours later.

Epstein’s legal team “doesn’t
dispute that he had girls over for
massages,” Goldberger said. But he
said their claims that they had sex-
ual encounters with him lack credi-
bility.

“They are incapable of being
believed,” he said. “They had crimi-
nal records. They had accusations of
theft made against them by their
employers. There was evidence of
drug use by some of them.”

What remains for Epstein is yet
to be seen.

The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment has asked the FBI to investi-
gate the case. It also has returned
the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.

In New York, candidates for
governor and state attorney general
have vowed to return a total of at
least $60,000 in campaign contribu-
tions from Epstein. Meanwhile,
Epstein’s powerful friends have
remained silent as tabloids. and
Internet blogs feast on the public
details of the police investigation.

Goldberger maintains Epstein’s
innocence but says the legal team
has not ruled out a future plea deal.
He insists Epstein will emerge in the
end with his reputation untarnished.

“He will recover from this,” he

You need your space and privacy. You don't like to be smothered. Jayna

You lave your partner unconditionally and don’t try to make them

change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When
you fall, you fall hard.

Brand name:

Xanax

Pronounced: ZAN-ax
Generic name: Alprazolam
Other brand name: Xanax XR

Why is Xanax prescribed?

Xanax is a tranquilizer used in the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or the treatment
of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorder is marked by unrealistic worry or excessive fears and
concerns, Anxiety associated with depression is also responsive to Xanax.

Xanax and the extended-release formulation, Xanax XR, are also used in the treatment of
panic disorder, which appears as unexpected panic attacks and may be accompanied by a

fear of open or public places called agoraphobia. Only your doctor can diagnose panic disorder

and best advise you about treatment.

Some doctors prescribe Xanax to treat alcohol withdrawal, fear of open spaces and strangers,

depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and premenstrual syndrome.

Most important fact about Xanax

Tolerance and dependence can occur with the use of Xanax. You may experience withdrawal
symptoms if you suddenly stop using the drug or reduce the dosage too quickly. Withdrawal
symptoms are listed under "Xanax side effects" The drug dosage should be gradually reduced
and only your doctor should advise you on how to discontinue or change your dose.

How should you take Xanax?
Xanax may be taken with or without food. Take it exactly as prescribed. Do not chew, crush,
or break the Xanax XR tablets.

--If you miss a dose...

If you are less than 1 hour late, take it as soon as you remember. Otherwise skip the dose
and go back to your regular schedule. Never take 2 doses at the same time.

--Storage instructions...

Store Xanax at room temperature.

Xanax side effects

Side effects cannot be anticipated. If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor
as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking
Xanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.

Side effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with
continued medication. However, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.

e Side effects of Xanax may include:

Decreased libido, drowsiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,
speech difficulties, weight changes

@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:
Constipation, decreased libido, depression, drowsiness, fatigue, impaired
coordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,
speech difficulties, weight changes

e Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or
Xanax XR:
Anxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,
depression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot
flushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle
cramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,
weight loss

Why should Xanax not be prescribed?

If you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,
you should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or
Nizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.

Do not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrow-angle
glaucoma.

Anxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.
Discuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.

Special warnings about Xanax

Xanax may cause you to become drowsy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating
dangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental
alertness is not recommended.

If you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than
for anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long
intervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor
supervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.

As with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage
suicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria known as mania. If you notice any new or unusual
| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.

Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,
alcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.

,

Possible food and drug interactions when taking Xanax
Xanax may intensify the effect of alcohol. Do not drink alcohol while taking Xanax.

Never combine Xanax with Sporanox or Nizoral. These drugs cause a buildup of Xanax in the
body.

If Xanax is taken with certain other drugs, the effects of either could be increased, decreased,
or altered. It is important to check with your doctor before combining Xanax with the
following:

Amiodarone (Cordarone)

Antihistamines such as Benadryl and Tavist
Carbamazepine (Tegretol)

Certain antibiotics such as Biaxin and erythromycin
Certain antidepressant drugs, including Elavil, Norpramin, and Tofranil
Cimetidine (Tagamet)

Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune)

Digoxin (Lanoxin)

Diltiazem (Cardizem)

Disulfiram (Antabuse)

Ergotamine

Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Fluvoxamine

Grapefruit juice

Isoniazid (Rifamate)

Major tranquilizers such as Mellaril and chlorpromazine

Nefazodone

Nicardipine (Cardene)

Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia)

Oral contraceptives

Other central nervous system depressants such as Valium and Demerol
Paroxetine (Paxil)
Propoxyphene (Darvon)
Sertraline (Zoloft)

Special information if you are pregnant or breastfeeding

Do not take Xanax if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There is an increased
risk of respiratory problems and muscular weakness in your baby. Infants may also
experience withdrawal symptoms. Xanax may appear in breast milk and could affect a nursing
infant. If Xanax is essential to your health, your doctor may advise you to stop breastfeeding
until your treatment with Xanax is finished.

increased by 1 milligram a day every 3 or 4 days. You may be given a dose from 1 up toa
total of 10 milligrams, according to your needs. The typical dose is 5 to 6 milligrams a day.

If you're taking Xanax XR, the usual starting dose is 0.5 to 1 milligram once a day taken in
the morning. Depending on your response, the dose may be gradually increased by no more
than 1 milligram every 3 or 4 days. The usual effective dose is 3 to 6 milligrams a day. Some
people may need a larger dose to relieve their symptoms. Others, including older adults and
those with liver disease or other serious illnesses, may need to use lower doses.

CHILDREN

Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 18 years of age.

OLDER ADULTS

The usual starting dose for an anxiety disorder is 0.25 milligram, 2 or 3 times daily. The
starting dose of Xanax XR is 0.5 milligrams once a day. This dose may be gradually increased
if needed and tolerated.

PATIENTS SWITCHING FROM XANAX TO XANAX XR

Xanax XR that equals the current amount you're taking. If your symptoms return after
switching, the dose can be increased as needed.

Overdosage

An overdose of Xanax, alone or after combining it with alcohol, can be fatal. If you suspect an
overdose, seek medical attention immediately.

e Symptoms of Xanax overdose may include:
Confusion, coma, impaired coordination, sleepiness, slowed reaction time

determined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is asa
prior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I
immediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine
it and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and
brought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on
that. The tape was placed back in the original container and is
retained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property

inspected for future use. The items collected were placed into
evidence.

It became evident that some of the recordings were recorded with
background noise and some interference. The calls most affected were
the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson.
I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are
able to be legible with the use of the equalizer by lowering the
background noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a
tape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of
the tape marked Property Number 05-243 to have it recopied to have an
original in evidence and a working copy with the file.

Upon researching the file, it was discovered that the suspect, Haley
Robson's cellular calls were subpoenaed incorrectly. The suspect
telephone number was 561-308-0282 and the original request was for
561-908-0282. I requested the information through Cingular Cellular
Service from February 2005 through the present. The purpose was to
have a record of Robson making calls to victim, Jeffrey Epstein and
the frequency of calls. The request was submitted to the State
Attorney's Office.

On March 30, 2005, I was asked by Sgt. Daniel Szarszewski to begin
conducting surveillance and trash pulls reference Detective Pagan
conducting a criminal investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein. I was
advised that Epstein was possibly engaging in sexual contact with
young females.

On March 30, 2005, I made contact with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation
Office Supervisor Tony Higgins and requested trash pulls for 358 El
Brillo Way to begin on March 31, 2005.

On March 31, 2005 at 9:20 a.m., I responded to the area of 358 El

Jeffrey Williams. I observed Williams enter the driveway of 358 El
Brillo Way, collect the trash bags from Epstein s property and place
the contents into an empty sanitation truck. I followed Williams to a
nearby area, were he turned over seventeen white plastic trash bags,
which were collected from Epstein s property.

I took the trash bags to the sanitation department were I sifted

a surveillance vehicle equipped with a video monitoring device. The
surveillance vehicle was parked on El Brillo Way approximately fifty
feet east of Epstein s driveway. The purpose of the video
surveillance was to gather investigative intelligence by monitoring
and recording all vehicle and pedestrian traffic entering and leaving
Epstein s property.

The video surveillance tapes were changed daily with a new Maxell

March 31, 2005 through April 05, 2005. On April 05, 2005, video
surveillance was concluded. I reviewed the video tapes and advised
Detective Pagan the surveillance video s yielded no evidentiary value.

made no contact with Marcinkova. While parked in the area, I also
observed Epstein s GMC Yukon truck leave the property as well as other
vehicles arrive and park across the street from the property. The
occupants of these vehicles appeared to be housekeepers, maintenance
men, and gardeners.

that the airplane belonging to Jeffrey Epstein of 358 El Brillo Way
was parked at the Palm Beach International Airport.

Detective Pagan requested that I begin trash pulls for the purpose of
gathering evidence and intelligence.

results and no evidence was collected.

No further trash was collected throughout the week due to the fact
that Epstein s security gates remained closed throughout the week;
therefore, the sanitation employees were unable to gain access onto
the property for collection of the trash.

As we entered onto the property, we encountered the house manager,
Janusz Banasiak who was in the guest portion of the house. The
guesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made. I
made contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth 04-07-1953, Fl DL

, and informed him of the search warrant for the
premises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence
and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and
members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr
Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior
decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of
515 W 20th Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for
Mr. Epstein s homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2005.to
do a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone
with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr.
Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised,
his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never
witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or
Nada.

I then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 315 East 14th Street in New York.
Mr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised
he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr.
Epstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein s
assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with
Epstein everywhere he goes.

names of any girls. Alessi was asked about any contact with anyone
from the Epstein organization. Alessi said he did speak with Mr.
Epstein shortly after my initial contact with him to find out what was
going on. Alessi also stated that approximately on November 11, 2005,
he was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy
Black. The investigator had called him to meet with him to ascertain
what he was going to tell the police. Alessi stated they met at the
Carrabba s Restaurant in Boynton Beach and discussed the same
questions I was asking him. I informed Mr. Alessi and Mr. Morrell
that as this is an ongoing investigation and anything we discuss
should be confidential. They both acknowledged the fact that the
information would be kept confidential. It should be noted that a
court reporter was present during the interviews and would be
providing a copy of the statements to me when they become available.

On November 21, 2005, I received a voice mail from Mr. Fronstin who
advised he would not be making Mr. Epstein available for any
statements. He did have some words that he wanted to relay on behalf
of Mr. Epstein. I telephoned his office and left a message for him to
return my call.

On November 29, 2005, I received a call back from Mr. Fronstin who
left a voice mail after hours on November 28, 2005, advising he would
return my call during normal business hours to speak with me reference
the case on November 29, 2005.

allegedly donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of Florida for massages.

why he has had many massages. Mr. Fronstin stated he appreciated the

innocent if the allegations are not substantiated. Mr. Fronstin was
told of the allegations that the private investigators assigned to the

A review of the telephone message books, which were obtained during
the search warrant, was conducted in which various messages from
different dates were made to Jeffrey Epstein. The telephone message
books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message
is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated
edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls,
dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I
recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been
interviewed. The body of the messages was time of the day that they

called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers
were located in which the body of the messages were, "Ihave girls. for
him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah

for Jeffrey Epstein. Based on the context of the body of the
messages, I requested subpoenas for subscriber information on the
telephone numbers and the time frame involved. Copies of the messages
were made for evidentiary purposes.

I obtained MMH igh school yearbooks for 2005, 2004 and

On 102005 at approx 0930hrs I assisted with the execution of a
search warrant at 358 El Brillo Ave, Palm Beach.

Initially I was assigned to enter the residence and conduct a
sweep of the premises for safety purposes. I then accompanied CSEU
tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once
this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.

We began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage.
Nothing of evidentiary value was located.

We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets.
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained.

A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath
area I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item
was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not
used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.

We then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main
stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were
located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were
later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in
the bathroom.

We then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the
residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis
shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis
and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were
seized as evidence.

We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner
of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as
evidence.

I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was
Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the
beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant
service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search
was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation
with him regarding the reason for our presence.

Regarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place
and then collected by CSEU personnel.

This concludes my involvement in this case.

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way,
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media
related material from the residence.

Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with
the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the
CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,
printer, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search
and no external camera was located within this room.

The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,
i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media
was found.

After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis
via a property receipt.

I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk
area revealed no signs of any media devices.

Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of
the pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,
Marked with Serial Number 6WTIVN21, was secured and turned over the
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt.

I also located several media related items within Room B, which were
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence
Custodians.

I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and
turned over the Evidence Custodians.

proximity to the victim's. The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the
victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after
the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson.
Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson s cellular
telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6,

Additionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from
305-710-5165. The subscriber information confirmed that the number is
registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was
crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private
Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which
also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located
another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which
Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy
Black is among his clientele.

The aetna calls revealed Lavery had telephone contact with

interview them, or just prior. A background was conducted on Lavery

investigating a case against Jeffrey Epstein and knew she had been at
the house. , Started to cry and advised she had put that part
of her life behind her. I explained that although she is seventeen
years old I needed to inform her parents that she would be
interviewed. She provided her home telephone number. I attempted
contact and left voice mail messages at the house to speak with her
parents.

Det. Caristo and I then located Tatum Miller at her residence located
at 4938 21 Road in West Palm Beach. I attempted to interview her
about Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff
Epstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she
would not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She.
asked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did
not wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point
in the investigation to know she was at Epstein's house and provided
girls to Epstein to work. I also explained that prior to our arrival
at her residence I had telephone contact with her father, Scott
Miller, who was told she would be interviewed. Tatum Miller is
currently seventeen years oldiand as a juvenile, parental notification
would be required. We then left the area and returned to the police
station.

While at the police station, I left another telephone message for

telephone. The telephone number 917-855-3363 is assigned to Sarah
Kellen and the financially responsible party is Jeffrey Epstein of 457
Madison Ave. in New York City, New York. The time frame which was
subpoenaed was September 2005, through October 2005. There were
eighty seven pages of calls made either to the cell phone or from the
cell phone. The local (561) numbers were analyzed. A spread sheet
was prepared and placed into the attachment file of who was called.

The unknown numbers were researched using FoneFinder.com and subpoenas
were requested to determine subscriber information. This was done to
identify additional victims or witnesses. The analysis revealed that
Kellen had called the victim/witnesses frequently when Epstein was in
the Town of Palm Beach to "work." This confirms what the girls
interviewed had previously stated. Kellen would notify them when
Epstein was in town and their willingness to "work." The CD was placed
into evidence.

was the telephone number for Haley Robson during the time frame when

the victim, §§vas brought to the Epstein house to "work." An

analysis of the phone records, of all incoming and outgoing calls,
showed that on February 6, 2005, the day the victim, as brought
to the house, Robson first called Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant,

at 917-855-3363at 12:50 pm (EST). The next call was made to Epstein's
house in Palm Beach, at 12:52 pm (EST). The following call was made
to the victim, ae 1:01 pm (EST) and at 1:02 pm (EST). This

confirms the information provided by the victim and victim's father.
I photo copied the records and enlarged the page 8 of 10 to show the
calls made by Robson on February 6, 2005.
To this date, I have not heard from PE 2s: li

additional witnesses such as house employees who have been reluctant
to speak with law enforcement.

states that her interests include music, theater and weed (Marijuana) .
I reviewed her packet in which Miiiiigeclares her love for her live-in

The letter Mr. Dershowitz sent advised he was looking into the
allegation that one of the private investigators used by the private
attorneys of Epstein, attempted to impersonate or state that they were
police officers from Palm Beach. Mr. Dershowitz advised that the
investigators used to interview ! had "quite a distinct

themselves as a police officer. This package was sent to both ASA

During a sworn taped statement,,.Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six moths. e was referred by

associates and his employment lasted the months Of November 2004
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary
"Leslie" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal
assistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in
residence.

I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them
comfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them.

Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.
They would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if
any of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask
their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate
like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez
stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be
mMasseuses. He stated_one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered
a dozen roses to Mn igh school for one of the girls
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high
school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the
massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.
He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys™scattered on the floor.
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put
them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.

Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a ‘car and rent a ,
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself
as a "human ATM machine" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to
purchase several gifts and provide them as tips to the girls. I asked

On January 19, 2006, Det. Caristo and I met with Johanna Sjoberg at
622 Holly Drive in Palm Beach Gardens. Sjoberg was identified as a
licensed massage therapist who had previously been seen on Epstein's
property when physical surveillance was done. Sjoberg was told of the
on going investigation and I felt she may have information pertaining
to the case. During a sworn taped statement, Sjoberg stated she met
Epstein three years ago when Ghaline Maxwell approached her while she
was attending Palm Beach Atlantic College to work around Epstein's
house. , Maxwell had told her that they needed some girls to work at
the house to answer phones and run errands. Sjoberg accepted the job
and began working at Epstein's house on El Brillo in Palm Beach.

would be notified when Epstein would travel to Palm Beach. Sjoberg
advised she would be notified by Maxwell, Epstein or Sarah, his

‘between two consenting adults. I explained to her that she was not in
any trouble however as part of this investigation, I needed to ask
certain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein
would ask her to perform during the massage . He would instruct her to
rub ‘his nipples as he masturbated himself! Sjoberg stated she felt
"grossed" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just
continued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the
massages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize,the
vibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages.
Sjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he
maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When
Epstein would masturbate he would be covered.

I asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from
Epstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised
Epstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College.
She received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke down.

Additionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also
recommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Row in Palm
Beach. The client she was referred to was "Glenn" unknown last name,
and his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was
concluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach
Police Department.

While at the police station, I researched Florida tag X88-EFF which
was also previously seen on the property when there was physical
surveillance being done at the property. The vehicle is registered to
of Lake Worth, Florida. Researching Mr. [and the

vehicle revealed that his daughter, ad been driving
the vehicle and was cited for unlawful speed in Lake Clark Shores.

MMM photographed at a beach. An interview is forthcoming.

A review of the video disks which was extracted at the Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Office Computer Crime Unit revealed that only one
hidden camera was functional at the time. Several images of Epstein
working at his office were seen. Additional footage of Sarah Kellen
and Nadia Marcinkova was seen. There was other footage of females
seen. The identity of the females is unknown at this time, until such
time as I meet with certain females to show the video footage to
confirm if, in fact, it is them on the video. At this time it appears
that = and Haley Robson are seen sitting with Epstein beside
his desk in the evening hours. Due to poor lighting, a direct
confirmation cannot be made at this time.

Research conducted on
revealed she is a licensed Massage therapist with a Florida
conditional/active license number MA39723. |[—Jhad been previously
arrested for battery / unwanted touching and DUI. Requests for copies
of the reports involving the arrests were requested from the Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Office. The last number 561-309-0079 is
assigned to Thomas Rofrano of 9850 Alt A1A in Palm Beach Gardens.
Research on Mr. Rofrano, revealed that he is a Florida Chiropractic
Physician.

Vehicles that were previously documented on the property while
surveillance was being conducted were researched. I determined a tan
Chevrolet Camaro, bearing Florida license X88-EFF, was seen on the
property in which a young white female was seen entering the Epstein
property. Research was conducted which revealed that the vehicle is
registered to f Lake Worth. Mr. Q—Jhas two daughters,
Jana and Jana is currently residing in
Connecticut and is residing with her father in Lake
Worth. Research on revealed she was recently involved
in a traffic stop in Lake Clarke Shores in May 19, 2005. A request to
discover any information from the stop was requested.

I spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss who informed me that Janusz Banasiak
will be available for an interview tomorrow at the State Attorney's
Office in West Palm Beach at 1:30 pm. I informed her that I would be
at her office for the interview.

On January 19, 2006, Det. Caristo and I met with Johanna Sjoberg at
622 Holly Drive in Palm Beach Gardens. Sjoberg was identified as a
licensed massage therapist who had previously been seen on Epstein's
property when physical surveillance was done. Sjoberg was told of the
on going investigation and I felt she may have information pertaining
to the case. During a sworn taped statement, Sjoberg stated she met
Epstein three years ago when Ghaline Maxwell approached her while she
was attending Palm Beach Atlantic College to work around Epstein's
house. Maxwell had told her that they needed some girls to work at
the house to answer phones and run errands. Sjoberg accepted the job
and began working at Epstein's house on El Brillo in Palm Beach.
Sjoberg stated it was a part time job during the time she went to Palm
Beach Atlantic College. She continued going to Epstein's house and
would be notified when Epstein would travel to Palm Beach. Sjoberg
advised she would be notified by Maxwell, Epstein or Sarah, his
assistant, when he would travel to Palm Beach. Sjoberg stated she
began providing massages to Epstein before she became a massage
therapist. She continued giving massages not only to Epstein but to
Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah, his assistant. Sjoberg was asked about
what occurred during the massages. Sjoberg stated as she was twenty

three years old when she met Epstein, anything that happened was
between two consenting adults. I explained to her that she was not in
any trouble however as part of this investigation, I needed to ask
certain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein
would ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her to
rub his nipples as he masturbated himself. Sjoberg stated she felt
"grossed" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just
continued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the
Massages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the
vibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages.
Sjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he
maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When
Epstein would masturbate he would be covered.

I asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from
Epstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised
Epstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College.
She received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke down.

Additionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also
recommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Row in Palm
Beach. The client she was referred to was "Glenn" unknown last name,
and his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was
concluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach
Police Department.

While at the police station, I researched Florida tag X88-EFF which
was also previously seen on the property when there was physical
surveillance being done at the property. The vehicle is registered to
of BRM, Florida. Researching Mr. J§Jand the

vehicle revealed that his daughter, ad been driving
the vehicle and was cited for unlawful speed in Lake Clark Shores.
The vehicle is a tan, Chevrolet Camaro, 2-door. I researched

date of birth, J. resides at in

. BRR bas a my space page called

www.myspace.com/pinkpetals. In her web page, shows various photos of

hotographed at a beach. An interview is forthcoming.

A review of the video disks which was extracted at the Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Office Computer Crime Unit revealed that only one
hidden camera was functional at the time. Several images of Epstein
working at his office were seen. Additional footage of Sarah Kellen
and Nadia Marcinkova was seen. There was other footage of females
seen. The identity of the females is unknown at this time, until such
time as I meet with certain females to show the video footage to
confirm if, in fact, it is them on the video. At this time it appears
that  — and Haley Robson are seen sitting with Epstein beside
his desk in the evening hours. Due to poor lighting, a direct
confirmation cannot be made at this time.

Inv. Continues.

February 6, 2005. According to the victim’s father, Robson drove a pick up truck. Robson drove the victim
to Palm Beach. Sometime on the way there, a conversation occurred between Robson and the victim whereas
Robson reportedly told the victim that if Jeffasked her (the victim) age, she should say she was eighteen. The
victim recalled that Jeff's house was ona dead end street. The victim described Epstein's house as a two story
pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. The girls walked up a driveway, past what
appeared to be asmall guard/security room. In fact, the victim recalled a male approaching them asking what they
wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Jeff. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house.
The victim stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter
the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly after, Epstein and
a woman, described as white with blond hair entered the kitchen. The victim believed the woman was Epstein's
assistant. The victim added that the woman did not seem friendly and kept her responses short and direct. Epstein
introduced himself to the victim as Jeff . The victim described Epstein as being approximately forty-five years old,
a long face, and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair.

Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving the victim alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They
all spoke briefly in the kitchen. The victim stated the woman instructed her to follow her upstairs, which she did.
The victim recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, toaroom. Upon entering the room there
was a large bathroom to the right. The victim recalled a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door
oneach side of the sofa. The victim recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several
photographs of naked women ona shelf. According to the victim, the woman led her to a room that had a
massage table init. The woman started to fix up the room, putting the covers on the table and taking lotions out.
She then told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.

The woman left the room, and soon after, Epstein walked in wearing only a towel and told the victim to take off
herclothes. The victim stated he was stern when he told her to take offher clothes. The victim said she did not
know what to do as she was the only one there in the room. The victim took off her shirt leaving her bra on.
Epstein, had removed his towel and told the victim to take offeverything . The victim stated Epstein exposed
himself when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. The victim stated she
removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a
specific lotion for her to use. As the victim began to give Epstein the massage, he told her to get on his back. The
victim stated she straddled herself on Epstein s back. The victim stated her exposed buttocks were touching
Epstein s bare buttocks.

The victim said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage, telling her to go clockwise, etc.
Epstein then turned over and instructed the victim, to massage his boobs. The victim resumed massaging his chest
area. The victim was now standing on the ground. Epstein turned to his side, started to rub his penis in an up
and down motion. The victim stated Epstein held on to the small of her back as she massaged his chest and
shoulder area. Epstein pulled out a purple vibrator and began to massage her vaginal area. The victim stated there
was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. The victim recalled Epstein ejaculating because
he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table.

Epstein then left the room and the victim got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. The
victim admitted to getting paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before they left, Epstein asked the
victim to leave her phone number. As they were leaving the house, Robson stated she received only two hundred
dollars that day for bringing her.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the
driveway. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were
investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to
accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the
interview she would be returned home.

Upon Robson’s entry in the unmarked Detective vehicle, I placed a tape recorder within the vehicle to record any
conversations within the vehicle. During the ride back to the police station, Robson advised she is attending Palm
Beach Community College in the Palm Beach Gardens Campus and is majoring in journalism.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I
explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave
at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated
she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein.
Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer
and agreed to meet with Jeffrey. Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked her up and
she was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of
the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main
bedroom known to her as JeffEpstein’s bedroom. Sara arranged the massage table and covered the table with
asheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sara, then left the room and
informed her Jeff would be in, ina minute. Jeffentered the bedroom wearing only atowel. He laid on the table
onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He
tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how did he tried to touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she
felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told

Detective Joseph Recarey/ID No: 7915

Dear | |:

We write to request an investigation of the actions of Palm Beach County
Detective Joseph Recarey (“Recarey”) in the investigation of Jeffrey E. Epstein
(“Epstein”). Detective Recarey’s conduct of the investigation; his presentation of
the investigation to the State Attorney; and his conduct subsequent to the bringing
of charges against Epstein warrant disciplinary action.

As more fully set out below, the misconduct of which we are aware and for
which Detective Recarey should be disciplined falls into the following categories:

e Significant and material omissions of facts known by Detective Recarey

~ that were omitted from the Police Report and/or Probable Cause
Affidavits, which facts if known would have had and ultimately did have
a material impact on the decision whether and how to proceed.

e Significant and material misstatements of fact, which misstatements were
consistently slanted to support a finding of probable cause.

e The public release to the press of the Police Report and Probable Cause
Affidavits, all of which contained material omissions of fact and material
misstatements of fact, and which release was done to cause harm to
Epstein and to influence state and federal prosecutorial authorities.

Below we set out some of the most significant of these actions. Provided
herewith is an Appendix containing the underlying documents to which we refer.
Tab numbers correspond to the section (I or IT) and paragraph number.

I. Inaccuracies and Material Omissions

i. The Video Surveillance Equipment

Both the Police Report (at 43) and the Probable Cause Affidavits (at 18)
make particular mention of the “discovery” of video surveillance equipment (or
“covert (hidden) cameras” as they are called) in Epstein’s garage and
library/office. Inclusion of this information insinuates a link between the
equipment and the events at issue: the Probable Cause Affidavits note that “on the
first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [Recarey] found two covert cameras hidden
in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area
behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was reviewed which
showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses interviewed. All of
these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s
desk”. (Probable Cause Affidavits at 18).

events are described by || Detective Recarey cited to support a claim that
displayed in the house were photos fm and Marcinkova having sex. That is
contradicted by the recording

MEE Detective Recarey also reported that fill stated that on one occasion she
“continued rubbing his legs, thigh, and feet. .. . [and then Epstein] turned over
onto his back. She continued to rub his legs with oils. Epstein touched her breasts
and began to masturbate”. (Police Report at 40). That “episode” appears to be
synthesized from reports of two separate incidents. However, concerning neither
did Milf make mention of rubbing Epstein’s legs, thighs, and feet or of Epstein
turning over onto his back. Nor did she allege that Epstein masturbated while
touching her breasts. Detective Recarey also claims (Police Report at 40) that

during the sworn statement said “Epstein had purchased [Marcinkova] from
her family in Yugoslavia . . . [and] bragged he brought her to the United States to
be his Yugoslavian sex slave”. No such statement is made by , who refers to

Marcinkova as Epstein’s “girlfriend” and refers offhandedly to other women in the
home as “slaves”.

Nor did Detective Recarey include admission that on one occasion
she engaged in sexual conduct with Epstein’s girlfriend as a birthday “gift” to
Epstein. Neither is attention paid in the Probable Cause Affidavits of the fact that

GE naintained a MySpace webpage in which she admitted to various criminal
and dishonest acts, including creating false references for her work and her
extensive drug use.' Nor does Detective Recarey include that refused to
discuss the disposition of the thousands of dollars she said she was given by
Epstein. (Transcript at 31). Or that she falsely claimed not to use drugs (id.)
despite her MySpace entries that scream “I can’t wait to buy some weed! !!!!!!”.
Finally, Recarey knew that __ was not to be believed when she claimed she had
been given a car by Epstein because when preparing the Probablt Cause Affidavits

. A fleeting reference can be found in the Police Report (at 67), however, her marijuana use is only
generally noted and no mention is made of her other admitted or proven dishonest conduct, including the
report of her thefts from her employer.

Recarey was in possession of the two month rental agreement, contradicting -
statements. Yet HMM fanciful claim that she was given a car appears in the Police
Report, without reference to the fact that Recarey knew that to be untrue. Nor is

the evidence that she engaged in multiple thefts from her retail employer included.

a Sworn Statement of Juan Alessi. The Police Report and Probable
Cause Affidavits detail information purportedly obtained by Detective Recarey
from Juan Alessi, a former Epstein house manager. The statement was recorded by
a stenographer. A comparison of the transcript and the Police Report and Probable
Cause Affidavits reveal significant differences. Detective Recarey reports that
“Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were
younger and younger”. (Police Report at 57). Alessi actually stated that for the
most part the masseuses did not appear young. (Transcript at 9). Alessi further
declared that only “one” girl was young and in his judgment she looked “16 or
17”. Gd.).

Detective Recarey also notes (Police Report at 57) that Alessi claimed “the
bed would almost always have to be made after the massage”. This statement is
directly contradicted by other witness statements, which are devoid of any
accusation by any woman that any activity ever occurred on the bed. Indeed,
Alessi himself actually stated that on a “few” occasions the bed was unmade after
a massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (Transcript at 11-12). Alessi
further explained that even in the absence of a massage he could be called upon to
make Epstein’s bed three or four times a day, (id), thus providing an innocent
explanation for the frequent bed making. It was in fact Detective Recarey who
suggested that “something else occurred”, and even then, Alessi insisted he did not
know of “something else”: “. . . or something else, I cannot [say]”. (/d.).

There is also no mention of Alessi’s burglary of the Epstein residence; his
theft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi’s suicidal ideations, all of
which made him an unreliable witness.

4. Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash, The Police Report details
the police “discovery” in Epstein’s trash of what is described as pieces of “sex

toys” and makes the point that these materials corroborate witness statements.
Omitted from both the Police Report and the Probable Cause Affidavits is the fact
that during the course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the
police realized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the entirely innocent broken handle
of a salad server. Though the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report
and Probable Cause Affidavits, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the
discovery of this new and highly relevant evidence.

3. Polygraph Examination and Report. The State Attorney was
provided with a report of a polygraph examination of Epstein and the polygraph

examiner was subsequently interviewed by the State Attorney. The polygraph
exam focused on the allegations being made with respect to The
report confirmed that (a) no sexual conduct occurred; (b) Epstein never threatened

es (¢) told Epstein she was 18 years old; and (d) Epstein
believed gg Was 18 years old. Though these results were provided to the
Police Department and Detective Recarey was given an opportunity to meet with
the polygraph examiner, after confirming that he would attend he inexplicably
failed to appear or to send a representative in his place. No information
concerning the fact of the exam appeared in the Police Report or the Probable
Cause Affidavits.

6. Meetings with the State Attorney. Attorneys for Epstein provided
other information to the State Attorney, as well. Though clearly material, virtually
none of it was included in the Police Report. For example, at the meeting at which
the polygraph expert was made available for questioning, the psychiatrist who
conducted a psycho-sexual examine of Epstein (and who concluded he was
healthy) was also made available to discuss his evaluation. Also provided at the
meeting was information concerning ME MySpace website profile,
including her false representations that she was 18 and nude and otherwise
provocative photos that she chose to use to represent herself to the public. After

initially saying he would be present, Detective Recarey failed to attend or to send
a substitute.

II. Unreported Criminal Histories and Other Factors Bearing on

Credibility of the Witnesses

Virtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the
Probable Cause Affidavits had a background that raised questions as to whether
his or her testimony could support a finding of probable cause, let alone sustain
what would be the State’s burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the
witnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which
undermines any argument that one witness corroborates another). Though this
evidence was given to Detective Recarey, none of it was included in the Police
Report, the Probable Cause Affidavits, or released to the public.

1. Juan Alessi: former Epstein employee, terminated for cause; found
stealing money from Epstein; suspected of stealing a gun from Epstein’s home that
was never recovered in order to commit suicide; repeatedly burglarized Epstein’s
home.

2. father; he had a federal fraud conviction,
which was uncovered and turned over to the Detective Recarey during the course
of the investigation. M—Mserved 21 months in federal prison for his offense.
This raised questions about the motives in reporting the events.

En EE ie pmother; she had a state conviction for

identity fraud — criminal use of identification information. This information was
uncovered and turned over to Detective Recarey during the course of the
investigation and similarly raised questions about the motives in reporting the
events.

4. po a potential victim; she had pending charges for

possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia; she “came forward” as a result of
her arrest; she admitted on her MySpace webpage to multiple and frequent drug

use, lying to get her job and lies about the reason for her termination; a written
report detailing her multiple thefts from a former employer; parts of her story were
inherently incredible; she made false statements about having been given a car by
Epstein; and she refused to state the disposition of the money paid to her by
Epstein.

=. po a potential victim; she had multiple runaway

complaints lodged by her parents and was assigned to a special high school for
drug abusers; she published false representations that she was 18 on her MySpace
webpage, along with nude photos of herself, boasts about having beaten someone,
details of her drug use and a claim that she was earning in excess of
$250,000/year. Nor is there reference to the fact that police had recently
responded to a complaint at her home to find her “under the influence of a
narcotic”.

The State Attorney relies on the professionalism, the integrity and the skill
of members of the Palm Beach Police Department to conduct investigations and to
report all material facts fairly and accurately. That is essential so that prosecutors
can make charging decisions consistent with the facts, the law, the appropriate
allocation of limited resources and public policy. If police officers hide facts,
misstate evidence, or otherwise fail to provide prosecutors with all material
information then justice cannot be served. It is our unfortunate but unmistakable
conclusion that Detective Recarey failed to discharge his duty in this matter.
Moreover, his decision to release to the public the Police Report and Probable
Cause Affidavits, particularly when they contained material omissions and
misstatements of fact, was intended to harm Epstein, ill served the criminal justice
system, and ultimately failed the people of Palm Beach County.

We are prepared to provide any other information you may need in

Fronstin had telephoned her reference this case. Although nothing was
discussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate
about massages.

I also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss reference the previous employees,
Juan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through
a subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on
Monday November 21, 2005 at 12:00 p.m.

On November 21, 2005, I met with ASA Weiss, Atty. Donnie Murrell and
Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney Office. ASA Weiss had
requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the
Alessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her attorney,
Donnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight
years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had
never had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her
husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted-of doing
house cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The
girls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not know any
of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that
when Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis
@Guring his stay in Palm Beach.

I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie
Murrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with
Mr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then
moved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.
Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance
person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s
arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing
with his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with
Epstein directly.

[x asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.
Alessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and
younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be
sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would
occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled
that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a
Massage. Alessi stated that there were. times towards the end of his
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made
after the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the |

Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 5/15/06
Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 5/15/06

On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate,
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration,
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's
house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed
driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida
registration of F30Q0F. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north
on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr.
Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain
jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I
traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was.
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane.

We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of
the executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach
County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm
Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on
the 10th at 5:00 pm.

On May 12, 2006, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State
Attorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was
requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to
her I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen,
and Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or
direct file, as sg much time has elapsed since the original request to
the Grand Jury. explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had
concluded the case _in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the
case to go forward.Jf Belohlavek stated the original offer was again
offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer
by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer.

rough times
Current mood: & sad

Everything sucks right now,

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.)
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time.
There's been so much death around me. It's really
overwhelming.

predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of
that time together will be horrible,...." the complete
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the
second day that we were here but all I did was get
applications. The day after that I was like “fuck this"
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired.
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool.
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it.
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview
the day he came in with the application, I think that's
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went ina
lil' while. It's only 3:45 right now.(h, it was so
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS
job and the lady called me back and told me that
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence
that she didn't need to call anyone else back,.....he
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound
fucking great,..] lied and said that he was the o

stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str83 No
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke
some resin (sp?) considering 1 have a limited supply
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

Center from Cingular Wireless for telephone number 561-308-0282. This
was the telephone number for Haley Robson during the time frame when
the victim, B® was brought to the Epstein house to "work." An
analysis of the phone records, of all incoming and outgoing calls,
showed that on February 6, 2005, the day the victim, 4g was brought
to the house, Robson first called Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant,

at 917-855-3363at 12:50 pm (EST). The next call was made to Epstein's
house in Palm Beach, at 12:52 pm (EST). The following call was made
to the victim,@@™at 1:01 pm (EST) and at 1:02 pm (EST). This

confirms the information provided by the victim and victim's father.

calls made by Robson on February 6, 2005.

To this date, I have not heard fro parents. I
will attempt to establish contact with them during the evening hours.
I received a package from Atty. Guy Fronstin, which was hand
delivered at the police station. Within the package, was a letter
from Alan Dershowitz, and two www.myspace.com profiles. The profiles
were that of Qi _==Dpe@mm and MySpace.com is a social
networking service that allows members to create unique personal
profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new
friends. This package was in response to a previous meeting in which
Mr. Dershowitz called to assist in the investigation in providing any

The letter Mr. Dershowitz sent advised he was looking into the
allegation that one of the private investigators used by the private

themselves as a police officer. This package was sent to both ASA
Lana Belohlavic and ASA Daliah Weiss at the State Attorney's Office.

DETECTIVE: Okay. So you understand everything that’s going on here and

everything that I’m asking you, correct?


po Correct.
lil DETECTIVE: Okay. Um. Obviously I’ve explained that I am investigating a
case, uh, involving a subject that you may know, um, by the name
of Jeffrey or Jeff Epstein. Uh, he’s a resident in uh, Palm Beach.
Um, I believe you may have some information pertaining to this
case. Um, if you could in your own words, um, can you explain
from the beginning, as to, uh, what happened, and
S| There’s like a year and a half, almost two years to go over. Like,
do you want me to go through everything, or do you want to
specifically ask me stuff?
DETECTIVE: //Well, ah, start from like how you met him, and then I'll, Pll take
you through.
a //Okay. un heard me over talk — we worked at
Hollister together in the Wellington Green Mall, and I was
mentioning to her how I wanted extra money to go to Maine. Um.
DETECTIVE: Is that where you’re from?
LS No, but I wanted to go camping. I like to go camping.
33. DETECTIVE: All right.
po So I wanted to go camping for the summer, and I couldn’t afford a
plane ticket. Andi cocs ‘Oh, well, you can get a plane
a7 ticket in two hours.” I said, what are you talking about? Like,
what are you, that didn’t make any sense to me a plane ticket in
two hours, what are you talking about? And she goes ‘Oh, we can
40) go and give this guy a massage, and, um, he'll pay two hundred
4] dollars for like forty-five minutes or an hour.’ And that’s all she
told me no details no nothing.

F | Um, a couple of days later, I believe it was a Saturday night. I’m
almost positive it was, cause I know I didn’t have to go to school
the next day. Um, and definitely wasn’t a Friday. So it next

Saturday night after that. She set it up, and I picked her up from
the her apartment, and we drove to the island and I worked, um,
and he paid her three or four hundred dollars to bring me.



DETECTIVE: Okay.

a And that was it.
© DETECTIVE: All right. Um, and this was a year and a half ago, correct?

would have been sixteen or seventeen, I don’t know.

af
an Just a massage.
DETECTIVE: Okay. Did she explain, um, how you would have to be dressed to
give a massage?
P| She said that he wanted cute girls, so | looked cute, did my best, I
didn’t — I didn’t think that it was what it was. I wasn’t naive
enough to think that he was gonna pay me two hundred dollars just
for nothing, [stutters] I, 1 don’t know, like | don’t know what was
going through my head. I absolutely don’t know. And I — the back
of my mind I was thinking, oh, well, it could be legitimate, but I
was also thinking, you know, at the same time, is she fucking
crazy? Like, this guy’s not gonna pay you money for not doing
4] anything, not letting him cop a feel or nothing. You know? So I
didn’t know what to think, I was like oh, Pll just go and I'll feel it
out and if I don’t like it, Pll leave. Like, in the middle of it, like I
don’t care. If he does something that I have a problem with then
I'll leave.

nothing inside of me. He increased my pay to three or four
hundred dollars as long as he could touch me. Um, J still never, I,

[giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not. I was like, I'll let
you touch me but I’m not gonna do that.
a This is 2005, right?
i Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the
New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a
year before they were supposed to come out. So ifI got it, I
obviously didn’t get a 2006 cause that’s this year. I got a 2005
Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. That car was

you went in, you massaged him,

Sometimes I didn’t even deal with that. Sometimes he just asked

me to take off my clothes and like, he would have to do work, and
he’d be sitting at his desk or something and I'd just be naked there
watching television or reading a book but I’d be naked. Or, um,

sometimes he wanted to just watch TV or read and he’d lay in his

bed and he’d ask me to just take my clothes off and lay with him.
And that’s it, not touch him or anything and Id get paid three
hundred dollars for that for twenty minutes. Um, sometimes he’d
just invite me over for breakfast or dinner, or just to use the
swimming pool, and I'd get paid for that too.

two hundred dollars, you know?

like — this person, by the way, who said this stuff that I’m about to

broken up, and he just did it one day, he just did it without asking
or anything. And then | said what are you doing I said you know
that’s not cool and he goes ‘Oh I thought we did that last time.’

don’t I just give you something extra and we can try this out.” And

that I’ve looked up on the internet. Um, what he specifically told

= me when I asked him the first time was “Oh I’m a brain scientist’

and | said what the fuck is a brain scientist? I was like that’s not a

real job you’re like tell me the truth but anyway I took that as he,

he told me his explanation was ‘It’s my job to know how people’s

brains work’ and I said, whatever the fuck that means, whatever,

you know you’re just some old guy, and I went home. And then I
looked up on the internet, um, about him and he was apparently an
invest an he works for a financial firm and he would invest other
people’s money, like people sign their fortunes over to him he
invests it and he gets commissions off of the money that they
make, Umm and then he just takes, I know that he himself besides
investing other people’s fortunes you know he’s invested all his
money he owns tons of companies, umm sponsors sports teams,
does stuff like that he makes his money everywhere.

would get into NYU and he would pay for it. And I waited and I
waited and I scored great on my SATs, I got 4.0, like I did great in
school. | filled out my application and he told me that it wasn’t
good enough. And, so [| filled it out again and it was like three

this and then you know. He, not that I would want anybody to get
involved in this but I brought girls I didn’t like and really frankly
did not give a shit about. Girls that I knew were skanks that would
do anything. Who, like, girls that would just like suck dick in the

bathroom at school. Like not even people that I was friends with
I'd just hear a rumor about a girl and be like hey I know a way you
can make two hundred dollars. But I would tell them before they
went I would tell them flat out like this is what you gotta do, are
you cool with this cause I am not going to take you if you’re not.

And I stayed with her, um, I took all my clothes off and I did my
regular thing, and she just took her shirt off. And then he said
‘Okay well Miliiflis gonna finish up here, do you want to go wait by
the pool’ and she went downstairs and went swimming and I was
still naked.

f She got paid I think three, two or three hundred dollars for that,
probably two because it was her first time. The way it went was if
you worked there for the first like three times, you got paid two
hundred dollars. After that, if you were persistent and worked all
the time it was the on average three hundred dollars. Sometimes I
got paid a thousand. Just for the same thing. No varying in
det activities, just sometimes I’d walk out of there with a thousand
dollars or I mean I got lots of gifts, like I got lots of stuff from this
guy. I don’t know.

underwear I’m wearing right now, he gave me, like I’d, I'd go over
there and there’d be a bag of Victoria’s Secret underwear like
waiting for me like, talking like fifteen hundred dollars worth of
stuff. I got a plane ticket from him once, I got a car, I got
Christmas bonuses, | got movie tickets, like he’d buy me movie
F tickets, like he’d say ‘Hey, have you gone to the movies lately?’
I'd be like I dunno, no, not really, he goes ‘Do you want to go?’
He’d give me like eight movie tickets. I got show tickets, I went
and saw like David Copperfield I had like VIP like tickets or
something like that. Um.
DETECTIVE 2: The car, was that under your name or was it under his name?
aa No, it was under his, like I didn’t really care though, he’d let me
drive it around as much as I wanted. You know, I, I just got the
keys to it. And everything else was his business. He said if I ever
got pulled over, just to say that it was his car and whatever, that’s
it.

hang out with me and we, like I would go to the house and we’d

was me him and Nadia and I’m pretty sure that me and Nadia, like
she was like sucking his dick and like fucking him and stuff. But
like, that was all I was like maybe kissing her, you know touching
her some which way or the other. And um, towards the end of this
I remember that I had already finished, cause I remember it being
1] really uncomfortable. So I remember specifically that I had
je already finished. She, it was me, him
DETECTIVE: //What do you mean by you finished with?
a He gave me an orgasm. With his hand.
DETECTIVE: //Right. Okay.
a) Um, UII need to show you, like what I’m talking about, like the
positioning that we were. It was like, okay, here’s the thing,
Ae there’s the like little flower thing, then here’s the massage table. |
was right here, he was right here, she was here. Um. And, I was
standing up, and he just pushed me over the table, and he did his
thing with me.
2? «€©DETECTIVE: Okay. Were you facing the table? Were you?
| I was, I was face down on the table. Like face down, hands like on
my head, holding, I don’t, I don’t I mean I wasn’t fighting really.
So I don’t know if he was holding me down to kinda stop me from
fighting, or what he was doing. He’s just a really weird, he’s into
really weird stuff. Like, I was just bent over and my face was on
the table I was face down on the table. And then he did his thing.
So. But anyway, Nadia was right here and I’m pretty sure she was
naked and the couch is like nght behind, but um that’s how it
happened.
39°. DETECTIVE: How long was he, how long did that take?
Ei He was only in me for like a minute or two, I don’t even know if
you could say that long. He put it in, did a couple of pumps or
whatever the fuck you wanna call it, and I was like ‘What are you
doing?’ [giggles] I go ‘What are you doing?’ He’s like, ‘Oh, I just
wanted Nadia to see this.” Then that was that.

Did he ejaculate inside?

No. Not in me, not on me. I don’t remember any time. I don’t
remember specifically that time, um whether or not he finished
from having sex with me or whatever you wanna call it.

Okay. How much did you call — that was in the middle of the two
year thing?

Not so much towards the end, but definitely once I was
comfortable with working there once | like would go there a lot,
yeah. That was, it had to be towards the middle cause towards the
end [ only worked very sporadically throughout like maybe once or
twice a month, not even. Um, in the middle I was working the
most, I’d work every day that he was in the country. Every single
day.

Okay. From that moment on, that’s when the car came in? After
that the car came?

I told him that my parents kicked me out, um, well, oh. Okay, this
is how it went. Like I’m sorry, I’m remembering more and more
as I talk to you. I worked for him and then I, I think after like
things started getting like too like in like once he started going
further and further, um I stopped working for him for a little while.
Like, Sarah left a message on my cell phone. My mom took my
cell phone away and she checked my messages and Sarah goes
‘Oh, Jeffrey wants to know if you can come by and bring a friend.’
And my mom goes ‘What the fuck are you doing? Like, are you a
prostitute?’ And | was like, ‘No mom, I’m just a secretary, and
you know what, he has a girlfriend, Nadia um doesn’t have any
friends,’ I’m like ‘she wanted me to bring over people to hang out,
you know.” And my mom was like, okay, | don’t know. She was
in denial, obviously, she, I think she knows that deep down in her
heart. But um, after my mom heard that message she made me
phone him, she made me call Sarah, um, and tell her right in front
of my— my mom made me tell Sarah right in front of her that I
couldn’t work there anymore, that I couldn’t go there anymore.
And then a few months went by at, no like, well I guess you could
say like a month or two, I don’t want to say a couple, like a few
months cause it wasn’t that long. But it was like a month or two,
and then I called him and um, I told him that I, my parents kicked
me out and so they weren’t, they weren’t gonna interfere with
anything and then I continued to work. Towards the end, I stopped
working for about probably six weeks, um, cause my boyfriend
Will, the kid that I’m still with now. Um, he, it like tore him up to

a couple times and I worked, but then Will found out. And that’s

closed and nobody saw anything.

Q. Would you clean up after?

A. Once in a while, yes, I did. Most of the

GO. Did it appear as if there was going to be
more than one massage going on in the room?

A. More than one massage? I don't know. It
was massages. There was massages, because it was a hot
oil, and it was -- you know this vibrator, the neck

towels. We used a lot of towels in the house. Used like
maybe 40, 50 towels a day, because every time he go in

Det. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the
South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via-property receipt.
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence

Custodians.

I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and
turned over the Evidence Custodians. *

This concluded my participation in the search of the residence.

On December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to

subpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez,
who resides in Miami, had eluded the process_servers previously and

was not served the investigative subpoena. (A telephone message was

left as she is not available during the week of 12/19/2005.) I made

contact with State Attorney Inv Theresa Wyatt and requested the same
via telephone message.

I then researched the victim' Aillffcellular telephone subpoena data
which had been received from a previous subpoena request. I analyzed
the records which depict several calls from Haley Robson. The
telephone calls start on February 6, 2005 at 12:49 pm.; the same day
which the victim and the victim's father stated the incident occurred
at Epstein s house. The first incoming call was from Robson's
residence at 561 333-0180. The second incoming call from Robson's

from phone. On March 7, 2006, at 11:03 am, made a call

to the victim@™which lasted 492 seconds (8 minutes and 2 seconds) .
The victim then returned the call at 11:16 am which lasted 6 seconds.
The victim then made contact with at 11:22 am for 877.2 seconds
(14 minutes and 6 seconds). These sequences of calls were consistent
with what the victim had described to me on the date of the
intimidation. Immediately after speaking with the victim, J makes
a call to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, which lasts for
forty-eight seconds. A call is then immediately received, a telephone
number registered to a Corporation affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein
located at 457 Madison Ave in New York.. An extensive computer check
revealed 457 Madison Ave is a business address in which Epstein has
his corporations assigned to. Epstein had corporation attorney,
Darren Indyke, register the businesses and register himself as an
agent. I also observed Epstein has his El Zorro Ranch Corporation,
New York Strategy Group, Ghislaine Corporation, J Epstein and Company
and the Financial Strategy Group registered to this same address.
Finally, a third call is received by Qj at 12:02 pm from the same
corporate number which lasts 12 minutes and 1 second. It should be
noted that there is no further contact with either the victim during
the month of March or April of 2006. I also noted that there was no
further contact with Sarah Kellen or Jeffrey Epstein during the
mainder of the month of March or April 2006.

On June 1, 2006, ASA Lana Belohlavek telephoned me to inform me of the
meeting that occurred with Atty. Jack Goldberger and her reference
this case. She advised she would make her determination .9n whether to
file on this case or not by Monday June 5, 2006.

As we entered onto the property, we encountered the house manager,
Janusz Banasiak who was in the guest portion of the house. The
guesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made. I
made contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth 04-07-1953, Fl DL

and informed him of the search warrant for the
premises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence
and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and
members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr
Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior
decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of
515 W 20th Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for
Mr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2005 to
do a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone
with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr.
Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised,
his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never
witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or

Nada.

I then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 315 Fast 14th Street in New York.
Mr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised
he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr.
Epstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein's
assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with

Epstein everywhere he goes.

I interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey.
Bailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and: has worked with Zeff
for only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not
seen him. The interview was then concluded.

I then spoke with Douglas Schoettle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York

years. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and
speaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoettle stated he mainly speaks

Probable Cause Affidavit

Agency ORI#A FLO 500600

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at
358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, “I have girls for him" or "I

have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages.
During the execution of the warrant, I located a transcript for @jn Epstein’s
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein.{] located a wood colored armoire beside

Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located
“hich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed
_aich showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.

On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with fl dob | During a sworn taped
statement, [stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein’s house to provide a massage

that on Saturday evening 10/4/03, he left his briefcase at his
desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein
said when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately
$5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100
bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase.
Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday,
10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had
been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein
believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase.
Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was
sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black
Glock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind
his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been
taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was
in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day
weekend Aug. 30-Sept 1, 2003. The second time was a
weekend in mid September, 2003. Epstein stated he did not

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way
reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53.

Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the
amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident
and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a j|spy camera from a store on
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up [the camera which was ina
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it.
Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar
bill increments and left the bag on his desk aa he always does
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up
and twice to have $100. missing |from the bag and the suspects
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there
ware thirteen one hundred aotias bills still in the white envelope

and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the
suspect.

Epstein took me to the computer |room where he showed me a computer
monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and
then opened the center drawer td the desk. It appeared as though
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein

told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was

but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size
and shape. Epstein also pointed|/out that the suspect in the

video was wearing moccasin type/|shoes like his former houseman
did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who

was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt,

and a hat. Epstein provided me|with the former houseman's
information which was Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, living at

1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida.

eG advised Epstein that I would meed to obtain a copy of the
surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to
have in hands. Epstein told me|that he had limited working
knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who
had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday.
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information}

Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry
into the house from the sliding|glass doors on the south side
of the house but not the west side of house because he had
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house.

It is believed that the suspect/also left the house by the

same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed
me the bookcase behind the desk|where he kept his Glock 9 mm
handgun between the books which|was now missing. Epstein could
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this
time but advised he would contadét Gator Gun on Okeechobee

Blvd. to obtain the information

Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and
collected the envelope that the| money had been taken out of.

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage.

Con November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.

On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from
“Tovember 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler,

auffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I] asked Rodriguez about
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was inresidence. Rodriguez stated
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appe t ses.
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to for
one-of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high schoo] and were of high
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wal] close to Epstein's

Thanks for stopping at work to see me. ;)

I went to the beach again last night with Tony
Diaz. The police picked us up though. They
didn't like us swimming with the sea turtles.

Juno is a 24 hour beach. We watched the
sunrise. Beautiful.

How's your summer?

Hits From the BONG,.
Lyrics By: Cypress Hill

Hits fram the Bong
Hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong

Pick it

Pack it

Fire it up, come along

And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down

Just for a second

Don’t get ma wrong

It’s not a new method

Inhale

Exhale

Just got an ounce in the mail

I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my Double-Barrel Bong

Is gettin’ me stoned

I’m skill it

There's water inside don’t spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it

Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit

] Of the Skunky, Phunky, Smelly Green Shit

Sing my song

Puff all night long

As I take hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong y’all

Hits from the Bong

Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high

Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high

Let’s smoke that bowl

Hit the Bong

And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it

Unplug it

Don’t strain

I love you Mary Jane

She never complains

When I hit mary

With that flame

I light up the cherry

She’s so good to me

When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up

The smoke, through the bubbling water
Is makin’ it pure so I got ta

Take my hit and hold it
Just like Chong

I get the bowl and I reload it

Get my four-footer and bring it on

As I take hits from the Bong

Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high

Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high

Hits from the Bong
Gonna get high

FISHING TRIP

A couple goes on vacation to a fishing resort in
northern Saskatchewan.

The husband likes to fish at the crack of dawn;
the wife likes to read.

One morning the husband returns after several
hours of fishing and decides to take a nap.

Although not familiar with the lake, the wife
decides to take the boat out. She motors out a
short distance, anchors, and continues to read

{her book.

Along comes a game warden in his boat. He
pulls up alongside the woman and says, "Good
morning Ma'am, What are you doing?"

Reading a book, " she replies, thinking, :"Isn't
that obvious?"

You're in a restricted fishing area, " he informs
her.

"I'm sorry officer, but I'm not fishing, I'm
reading."

"Yes, but you have all the equipment. For all I
know you could start at any moment. I'll have
to take you in and write you up."

"If you do that, I'll have to charge you with
sexual assault, " says the woman.

"But I haven't touched you, " says the game
warden.

"That's true, but you have all the equipment.
For all 1 know you could start at any moment."

"Have a nice day ma'am, " and he left.

I hope we didnt bother you with our antics
tonight. I figure we need to find something
better to do with our time.

Of course, you are a welcome diversion, se I
figure that we didnt waste anything.

this is part of something i saved, from you. i
came across it tonight and it made me happy:

"I just want to kiss her on the forehead and tel/
her she's the most beautiful girl in the world"

right back at you, missy. that, along with the
rest of what you said, meant a lot to me then,
and still does. how serendipitous that i found it
tonight. (it was a crying in the back room
night.) =\

j meant to call you from work, but i'm sam,
thus, i didn't want to be a burden. and i have
no idea where my phone even is, as usual,
regardless, i hope you're having an ekeay
wonderful weekend...

Infelicitous Mar 8, 2005 10:47 PM

Remember when the police had Ian pinned to
the ground for threatening to slap you?
Remember when you were crying on the bus
and you used my jacket sleeve as a tissue?
Remember when Kurt pulled my chair from
beneath me and I didn't notice till my ass was
on the floor? Remember when things weren't
so difficult, when not everything had an alterior
motive, when you didn't need to put time aside
just to relax?

This is making me feel old.

Hi . Here's to good, bad and ugly times
and more to come.

the tragic tale of |Mar 8, 2005 7:19 PM

That reflector should have been attached to
the ground. And you say you're cursed, any
other reflector would have been stuck there for
another hundred years, but you pulled up to
the one that wasn't. The sky was beautiful that
“a8 |night, and so were you.

matching shirts. Then you lit napkins on fire.
That was a good day.

You haven't seen it yet, but still, i saw you
online and had to post first.... Remember when
we stayed up for how long watching Season
one of 24? when you dyed my hair blonde?
when you used to climb on the counters? when
you snuck out and left me a note to tell me
that you had? when we washed our hair in the
rain at city place? or layed on the stage and
looked at I Spy books? ohmygoodness we have
so many... you can remember the harder ones
though---lol MWAH!

clinic pass, may become something catchy,
and altogether worth hearing.

I hope that by now you have learned to cook,
clean, and sew. If not then you are disobeying
a direct order from a man, and shll face
punishment. As an inferior woman, this could
include death, or even imprisonment. I hope
that you respond in a postive way, Later,

to _. _.._, Robson along with an unknown, possibly Hispanic female,
picked her up at her father's house on 76th Lane. ~ _._:; told her
father that they were going shopping. It was later confirmed by

Robson —— with the unknown female to Palm Beach.
Sometime on the way there, a conversation occurred between Robson and

whereby Robson told ~_ ~~~ that if Jeff asked her
Pt age, she should say she was eighteen.
EE called that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. All
three girls walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small
guard/security room. In fact, i * , recalled a male approaching

them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see

interview them and expect the investigation to remain confidential.

Because of the time delay, there was no need for the victim to be
taken to a medical facility for a physical for the purpose of
obtaining evidence. There was also no need to take her to CPT as she
was already in a juvenile facility, with an assigned therapist, in
which coordinating a day and time to obtain a statement could be made.

Approximately 1/2 through the tape, the tape wrapped around the
spindle and became locked and stretched the tape. I examined it and
determined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is as a
prior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I
immediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine
it and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and
brought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on
that. The tape was placed back in the original container and is
retained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property

further damage could result to the recorded material and there is an

made for Det. Pagan by Evidence Specialist Annette Badger. The copy
was turned over to Detective Recarey.

On Friday, 09-23-05 at approimately 2:15 pm, I was in the process of
reproducing audio tapes (micro and standard) to standard size when it
was discovered, in the test review process, that tape number 2 was
blank. I notified Sgt. Frick and Det. Recarey. I was informed that
they had a prior copy and I could use it to make a master tape. I did
so and when reviewing and signing the evidence sheet, I noticed
Evidence Specialist Badger had written "#2 is blank."

I obtained that copy from Det. Recarey and made a new copy on a
standard size tape. The new copy was placed in the evidence bag under

Copies of the tapes that were submitted into evidence were requested.
Additionally, trash pulls were started on September 21, 2005. Sgt.
Szarszewski made telephone contact with Tony Higgins, Supervisor of
the Sanitation Department, and requested that trash be collected at
the Epstein House located at 358 El Brillo in Palm Beach. Sgt
Szarszewski met with Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed him
enter the property at 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams
exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty
well in the rear of the truck. Williams then drove away where he met
with Sgt. Szarszewski who removed the bags from the well and placed
them into one large black trash bag. The bag was returned to the
Police Station where I was waiting for him. Upon his arrival, we
inspected the bags where several notes and papers were found. These
notes contained names of girls with times. Additionally, there was a
note from .“@@™l™l™l™Mand ~ ____ to Jeffrey Epstein on a notepad, which
stated, "For a good time call _.__. = and ~ at" Tees." ALSo,
there was another telephone number on the note gues OL SO found
was a written note, which stated, ~~ can not come at 7 p.m.
tomorrow because of soccer. These items were written on notepads that
contain Jeffrey Epstein on the bottom of the notes. These items were
placed into evidence for future follow up. I requested subpoenas for
subscriber information on the telephone numbers listed above on the
note from SmMmmmMm@!and _..__. The cellular telephones Ga and
ME are both assigned to Cingular Cellular Service. Other notes
were found within the trash on Jeffrey Epstein pad, papers that
contained telephone numbers. One note had "_ _ with
written on it. This cellular number is assigned to Cingular Cellular
Service. Another sheet had written 434-7788 which is assigned to Bell
South Telecommunications. The subpoenas were picked up and submitted
to Cingular and Bell South Telecommunication for subscriber
information.

On September 22, 2005, I was informed by Sgt. Szarszewski that there
would be no trash pick up as it was recycle pick up day. A request
for copies of the micro and standard size cassettes were requested
from crime scene to familiarize myself with the interviews conducted.

On September 23, 2005, the tapes were received and I began to become
familiar with the interviews that were conducted. Det. Krauel had met
with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed
him enter the property of 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams
exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty

the bags where several notes and papers were found. The notes will be
inspected for future use. The items collected were placed into

evidence.

It became evident that some of the recordings were recorded with
background noise and some interference. The calls most affected were
the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson.
I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are
able to be legible with the use of the equalizer by lowering the
background noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a
tape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of
the tape marked Property Number 05-243 to have it recopied to have an
original in evidence and a working copy with the file.

Upon researching the file, it was discovered that the suspect, Haley
Robson's cellular calls were subpoenaed incorrectly. The suspect
telephone number was 561-308-0282 and the original request was for
561-908-0282. I requested the information through Cingular Cellular
Service from February 2005 through the present. The purpose was to
have a record of Robson making calls to victim, Jeffrey Epstein and
the frequency of calls. The request was submitted to the State
Attorney's Office.

October 3, 2005, at approximately 10:30 am, I was contacted by Sgt.
Frick to respond to the Palm Beach Police Station. Det. Krauel had
observed Jeff Epstein riding his bicycle on South County Road. Upon
my arrival, I met with Sgt Frick who advised, as Epstein was currently
in Town; we interview Haley Robson as to her involvement with Epstein
and the girls that are brought to his house. As we were to interview
Robson in the county, (outside of our jurisdiction), I contacted the
State Attorney s Office Investigation Division, and made contact with
Assistant Supervisor Investigator Carlos Ortiz. I requested
assistance to interview Robson as the interview may occur in the
county. Supervisor Ortiz assigned Investigator Mike Waites to assist
us at the location and interview of Robson.

Det. Dicks had responded to the address of Robson and viewed her
vehicle parked in the driveway. Robson's vehicle a red Plymouth Neon
baring Florida Tag of H49-PKB was parked in the driveway of 12247 72nd
Court in Loxahatchee. Sgt Frick and I responded to 120th Ave and

was briefed that should she wish to be interviewed within her home he
would be needed. However, should Robson agree to return to the police
station for further questioning, he would not be needed. Sgt. Frick

she is attending Palm Beach Community College at the Palm Beach

Gardens Campus and is majoring in journalism.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the

the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how
she came in contact with Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned
years of age she was approached by a friend Molly in the Canopy
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make

table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them
next to the massage bed. Sara then left the room and informed her
Jeff would be in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a
towel. He lay on the table onto his stomach and picked massage oil
for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated, He tried
to touch me and I stopped him. I asked how he tried to touch her. He
grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated
Epstein has a vibrator, which is large and white in color. Robson
told Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson
stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the
massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I
know you re not comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls.
He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to

On March 31, 2005, Sgt. Daniel Szarszewski requested that I set up a
surveillance vehicle on El Brillo Way and conduct video surveillance —
of the front exterior of Epstein's residence. At 3:00 p.m., I set up
a surveillance vehicle equipped with a video monitoring device. The
surveillance vehicle was parked on El Brillo Way approximately fifty
feet east of Epstein's driveway. The purpose of the video
surveillance was to gather investigative intelligence by monitoring
and recording all vehicle and pedestrian traffic entering and leaving
Epstein's property.

The video surveillance tapes were changed daily with a new Maxell
T-160 VHS tape. Video surveillance was established for Epstein s from
March 31, 2005 through April 05, 2005. On April 05, 2005, video
surveillance was concluded. I reviewed the video tapes and advised
Detective Pagan the surveillance videos yielded no evidentiary value.

On April 01, 2005 at 9:30 a.m., I responded to the area of 358 El
Brillo Way to meet with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, Jessie
Jones. While parked in the area of 358 El Brillo Way waiting to
collect Epstein s trash, I observed a white female, who I recognized
as Nada Marcinkova from her Florida driver's license photograph. I
made no contact with Marcinkova. While parked in the area, I also
observed Epstein s GMC Yukon truck leave the property as well as other
vehicles arrive and park across the street from the property. The
occupants of these vehicles appeared to be housekeepers, maintenance
men, and gardeners.

At 9:38 a.m., I met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee,
Jessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo
Way and collect the trash from Epstein s property. I followed Jessie
to a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from
the sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation
department, where I sifted through its contents. I collected mail
correspondences addressed to Jeffrey Epstein, automotive records and
personal documents for Janusz Banasiak and Beata Banasiak as well as

Jeffrey Epstein notepaper with the names and appointment times for
ee 4]

No last names or other personal information was
written on the notepaper.

While sifting through Epstein s trash, I also collected a three-inch
purple finger size object, which had a broken end. The object
appeared to be a broke piece from a sexual toy similar to a (Cyclone
Vibrator) possibly used for rectal gratification. The sexual object
was photographed for Detective Pagan, packaged in a biohazard evidence
bag (possible body fluids) and secured as investigative evidence. All
items collected from Epstein s trash were turned over to Detective
Pagan for evidentiary purposes.

On April 05, 2005 at 9:18 a.m., I met with Town of Palm Beach
sanitation employee, Jessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the

The following items were documented for Detective Pagan s
investigation for evidentiary purposes.

On April 06, 08, 11, 12, 13, 15, 2005, at approximately 9:30 a.m, I
met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employees. I observed the
employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash
from Epstein's property. I followed the employee to a predetermined
area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation
truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department,
where I sifted through its contents.

All of the documents collected from Epstein's trash during my
assistance were turned over to Detective Pagan for evidentiary
purposes.

On June 14, 2005, Detective Michelle Pagan contacted me and advised
that the airplane belonging to Jeffrey Epstein of 358 El Brillo Way
was parked at the Palm Beach International Airport.

Detective Pagan requested that I begin trash pulls for the purpose of
gathering evidence and intelligence.

I made contact with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation Office Supervisor
Tony Higgins and requested trash pulls for 358 El Brillo Way to begin
on June 15, 2005.

On June 15, 2005, I met with a sanitation employee. I observed the
employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash
from Epstein s property. I followed the employee to a predetermined
area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation
truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department,
where I sifted through its contents. The trash yielded negative
results and no evidence was collected.

No further trash was collected throughout the week due to the fact
that Epstein s security gates remained closed throughout the week;

therefore, the sanitation employees were unable to gain access onto
the property for collection of the trash.

when Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis
during his stay in Palm Beach.

I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie
Murrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with
Mr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then
moved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.
Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance
person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s
arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing
with his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with
Epstein directly.

I asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.
Alessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and
younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be
sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would
occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled
that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a
massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made
after the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the

He was asked if he remembered any names of the girls that massaged
Epstein. He tried to remember and was unable to provide any exact
names of any girls. Alessi was asked about any contact with anyone
from the Epstein organization. Alessi said he did speak with Mr.
Epstein shortly after my initial contact with him to find out what was
going on. Alessi also stated that approximately on November 11, 2005,
he was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy
Black. The investigator had called him to meet with him to ascertain
what he was going to tell the police. Alessi stated they met at the
Carrabba s Restaurant in Boynton Beach and discussed the same
questions I was asking him. I informed Mr. Alessi and Mr. Morrell
that as this is an ongoing investigation and anything we discuss
should be confidential. They both acknowledged the fact that the
information would be kept confidential. It should be noted that a
court reporter was present during the interviews and would be
providing a copy of the statements to me when they become available.

On November 21, 2005, I received a voice mail from Mr. Fronstin who
advised he would not be making Mr. Epstein available for any
statements. He did have some words that he wanted to relay on behalf
of Mr. Epstein. I telephoned his office and left a message for him to
return my call.

On November 29, 2005, I received a call back from Mr. Fronstin who
left a voice mail after hours on November 28, 2005, advising he would
return my call during normal business hours to speak with me reference
the case on November 29, 2005.

allegedly donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of Florida for massages.
The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him that is
why he has had many massages. Mr. Fronstin stated he appreciated the
way the investigation has not been leaked out into the media. I
explained to Mr. Fronstin that it is as important to protect the
innocent if the allegations are not substantiated. Mr. Fronstin was
told of the allegations that the private investigators assigned to the

A review of the telephone message books, which were obtained during
the search warrant, was conducted in which various messages from
different dates were made to Jeffrey Epstein. The telephone message
books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message
is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated
edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls,
dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I
recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been
interviewed. The body of the messages was time of the day that they

called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers
were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for
him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah

for Jeffrey Epstein. Based on the context of the body of the
messages, I requested subpoenas for subscriber information on the
telephone numbers and the time frame involved. Copies of the messages
were made for evidentiary purposes.

I obtained earbooks for 2005, 2004 and
2003. I first reviewed the 2005 yearbook and located most of the

On 102005 at approx 0930hrs I assisted with the execution of a
search warrant at 358 El Brillo Ave, Palm Beach.

Initially I was assigned to enter the residence and conduct a
sweep of the premises for safety purposes. I then accompanied CSEU
tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once
this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.

We began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage.
Nothing of evidentiary value was located.

“We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets.
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained.

A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath
area I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item
was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not
used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.

We then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main
stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were
located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were
later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in
the bathroom.

We then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the
residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis
shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis
and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were
seized as evidence.

We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner
of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as
evidence.

I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was
Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the
beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant
service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search
was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation
with him regarding the reason for our presence.

Regarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place
and then collected by CSEU personnel.

This concludes my involvement in this case.

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way,
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media
related material from the residence.

Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with
the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the
CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,
printer, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search
and no external camera was located within this room.

The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,
i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media
was found.

After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis
via a property receipt.

I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk
area revealed no signs of any media devices.

Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of
the pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt.

I also located several media related items within Room B, which were
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence

Custodians.

I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and
turned over the Evidence Custodians.

This concluded my participation in the search of the residence.

cellular phone 561-308-0282 occurred at 1:02 pm. The call durations
were one minute or less. The time frame was within thirteen minutes
apart. It should be noted that Robson s residence was in close
proximity to the victim's. The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the
victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after
the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson.
Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson's cellular
telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6,

2005.

Additionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from
305-710-5165. The subscriber information confirmed that the number is
registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was
crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private
Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which
also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located
another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which
Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy
Black is among his clientele.

The telephone calls revealed Lavery had telephone contact with «.._...
atid. =.,% either just after I attempted to
interview them, or just prior. A background was conducted on Lavery
which revealed he holds a current Private Investigator License. A
criminal arrest record revealed he had been previously arrested for
possession of cocaine and solicitation of prostitution.

I also researched the girls using www.myspace.com. This web site isa
new social networking service that allows members to create unique
personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and
new friends. The site allows one to establish your own myspace.com
page and decorate the page any way one wishes. I found the following

I received a Cingular Wireless packet which contained a CD which

investigating a case against Jeffrey Epstein and knew she had been at
the house. . started to cry and advised she had put that part
of her life behind her. I explained that although she is seventeen
years old I needed to inform her parents that she would be
interviewed. She provided her home telephone number. I attempted
contact and left voice mail messages at the house to speak with her

parents.
Det. Caristo and I then located Iii at her residence located
at j West Palm Beach. I attempted to interview her

about Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff
Epstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she
would not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She
asked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did
not wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point
in the investigation to know she was at Epstein's house and provided
girls to Epstein to work. I also explained that prior to our arrival
at her residence I had telephone contact with her father ,muuppes

who was told she would be interviewed. is
currently seventeen years old and as a juvenile, parental notification
would be required. We then left the area and returned to the police
station.

While at the police station, I left another telephone message for
parents. I began an analysis of Sarah Kellen's Cellular
telephone. The telephone number 917-855-3363 is assigned to Sarah
Kellen and the financially responsible party is Jeffrey Epstein of 457
Madison Ave. in New York City, New York. The time frame which was
subpoenaed was September 2005, through October 2005. There were
eighty seven pages of calls made either to the cell phone or from the
cell phone. The local (561) numbers were analyzed. A spread sheet
was prepared and placed into the attachment file of who was called.

The unknown numbers were researched using FoneFinder.com and subpoenas
were requested to determine subscriber information. This was done to
identify additional victims or witnesses. The analysis revealed that
Kellen had called the victim/witnesses frequently when Epstein was in
the Town of Palm Beach to "work." This confirms what the girls
interviewed had previously stated. Kellen would notify them when
Epstein was in town and their willingness to "work." The CD was placed

into evidence.

During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary
"Leslie" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal
assistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in
residence.

I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them
comfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them.

Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.
They would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if
any of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask
their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate
like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez
stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be
Masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered
a dozen roses to MI "igh school for one of the girls
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high
school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the
massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.
He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor.
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put
them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.

Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself
as a “human ATM machine" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that came to the house was
approximately fifteen. Each of the girls knew each other and all
seemed to know at High School who Mr. Epstein was.
When asked to identify these girls, Rodriguez stated he could not at
the moment but knew he wrote their names down on a journal he kept
during his employ with Mr. Epstein. He kept a journal in the event he
needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I
informed him I would need to view this journal to which he stated he
would research the book and contact me to provide the book. The
interview was concluded and left the area. I returned back to the

On January 25, 2006, Det Caristo and I, responded to 3307 Baltusrol
Lane in Lake Worth and met with Eaton stated last
year, when she was seventeen years of age, she met Jeffrey Epstein
through her former room mate Dana Burns. Burns was allegedly dating
Epstein at the time. Burns and Eaton had once cohabitated together
when they modeled. Eaton explained Burns called her on her telephone
and advised her that she was in Palm Beach and requested to see her.
Eaton made arrangements to meet with her at Epstein's house. Eaton
arrived and met Epstein and Burns. Burns and Eaton went to the Palm
Beach Mall together and went shopping. Eaton advised that Burns and
she had received money from Epstein to go to the mall. They visited
Victoria's Secret and purchased undergarments from the store utilizing
monies given by Epstein. Eaton advised she purchased one item and
Burns purchase various items. The money used to purchase the items

was the money given by Epstein.

Burns and Eaton continued shopping and having a day together. Eaton
stated Burns explained how she and Epstein have been dating each other
and he has been paying all of her bills. Eaton claimed Burns advised
they met in New York and had been dating ever since. They later
returned to Epstein's home and encountered Epstein. He had a brief
conversation with Eaton about her modeling career. He knew of her
modeling career from Burns. He requested to see her modeling
portfolio and explained that he could help her with modeling jobs.
Eaton had her book with her to show Burns and showed the book to
Epstein. He commented negatively about her photographs and portfolio.
Eaton felt uncomfortable with the comments made as she had been
working with other professional modeling companies who had offered her
work from her photographs. Epstein requested to see what was
purchased at the mall. Burns took out the undergarments which were
purchased. She immediately showed Epstein different sets purchased.
Epstein then requested to view what Eaton purchased. Eaton was
reluctant to show the outfit however since it was Epstein's money that
purchased the item, she pulled it out of the bag. Epstein asked her
to try it on. Eaton looked at Burns who told her "yeah, try it on."
Feeling compelled to try the undergarment outfit on; she went to
another room and put on the bra and panty set. She walked out to the
living room where they were sitting, and modeled the suit. She then
went back into the other room and changed back into her clothes.

Eaton returned into the room and told Burns she would be going home.
Burns scheduled another day for Eaton to return for massages with her.

Eaton stated within that same week, she returned to meet with Burns
and have a massage. Burns had told her that she would be unable to
stay with her as she would be going on a bike ride with Epstein.
Burns explained she could stay at the house and take advantage of the
massage.

leaving her panties on, and wrapped herself with a towel for the
massage. Eaton remembered that the door to the guest room was closed
but not locked. As the therapist was working her back, the door was
opened by Epstein and entered into the room. Eaton was trying to
conceal herself as Epstein was talking to her about his chiropractic
session. Epstein told Eaton turn over onto her back. Eaton
eventually turned over exposing her breasts to Epstein as he applied
pressure on her shoulder and her waist. Eaton stated Epstein "popped"
her back. Eaton removed her self from the table, got dressed and left
the house. Eaton further stated Burns had attempted to call her on
several occasions to invite her back to Epstein's house to which Eaton
replied "I'm busy." Eaton advised she has not had contact with either
Dana Burns or Jeffrey Epstein. It should be noted that her mother,
Suzanne Eaton was present during the interview. The interview was

On January 27, 2006, I made telephone contact with Christina Venero,
at 772-878-7280. Venero is a licensed massage therapist who had
frequented the home of Jeffrey Epstein. Ms. Venero has been unable to
meet with me in Palm Beach County, and because she lives and works in
Port St Lucie, a telephone interview was conducted. I explained to
Ms. Venero that there was an on going investigation involving Jeffrey
Epstein.

Venero stated she knows Epstein and has been employed by him for
approximately three years. Epstein has paid Venero to perform Swedish
Massages (Deep Tissue) on him and other guests. Venero explained that
approximately three year ago she met Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey
Epstein through a mutual friend. Epstein and Maxwell were looking for
a massage therapist. Venero stated since that time, she is notified
when Epstein is coming to Palm Beach. Venero stated she comes to his
house and provides the massage or massages. Venero explained she has
also massaged his guests and assistants. Venero continued that she is
paid $100.00 and hour for the massage.

I asked Venero if anything occurred during the massage that would have
made her feel uncomfortable. Venero stated she only provided massages
and that was it. She never was approached for anything else. I asked
if Epstein ever asked her to rub his chest she stated she would not
rub his chest as that is not part of her massage. Venero explained
that she was not Epstein's type. The girls she would see at Epstein's
house were very thin, beautiful and without tattoos. Venero explained
she has several tattoos that are visible. Maxwell and Epstein have
commented negatively about her tattoos previously when she has
provided massages.

I received a facsimile from T-Mobile Cellular service on telephone
number 561-317-5844, which is assigned to David Rodgers, pilot for Mr.

himself as she rubbed his chest. I asked her if Epstein ever touched
her breasts during the massages. Harrison replied. "Yes." I asked her

the lobby.

I located a telephone number for Courtney Wild and attempted to
contact her on several occasions. I called 561-856-2617 and spoke
with Ms. Wild who advised she would speak with me in Deerfield Beach
where she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to
meet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another
appointment to speak with her about this investigation. I have
attempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative

results.

On February 13, 2006, I met with David Rodgers at 7318 Heathley Drive
in Lake Worth. Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke
with Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since 1991.
He flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to.
Rodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers
stated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would
be no way of knowing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent
flight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up Dana Burns.
Rodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did
‘remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not
know who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger
manifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knows by name, Sarah
and Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male
passengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.
Mrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her
husband consult with an attorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak
with the family attorney to inform him of this questioning. I
explained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this
investigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers
could not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the
area.

I attempted to locate Britany Beale at 8358 Xanthus Lane in
Wellington. I left my business card for her to return my call. On
February 14, 2006, at 12:06 pm, I received a call back from Ms. Beale

On February 15, 2006, I made telephone contact with Brittany Beale who
provided directions to where I could locate her. Det Caristo and I
responded to 806 Old Dixie Hwy in Lake Park to meet with Brittany
Beale. Upon my arrival, I met with Beale in the parking lot directly
behind MAACO Auto Painting. She was advised I was there to speak with
her about an ongoing investigation that concerned Jeffrey Epstein in
Palm Beach. Beale stated she knows Epstein very well and did not want
to speak with me about Mr. Epstein. She was very fond of Epstein and
did not want to speak with me about anything concerning Jeffrey
Epstein. I explained to her that she was seen at the house and I
would like to speak with her. She stated she knew there was an
investigation and that I had spoken with other people and therefore I
should know what happened at Epstein's house. Beale ended the
conversation and walked back into her boyfriends business, Blanton
Automotive. Det Caristo and I left the area and returned to the
police station.

Investigation continues.

A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006,
in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been
called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against
Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's
Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was
postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of
material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on
myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The
State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material.

I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in
which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation.
The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented
vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one
of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for
dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County.

I continued to research other names that were acquired either from
interviews or intelligence gathered during the investigation. I

located Nicole Radabaugh in Royal Palm Beach. I responded to
During the interview, Radabaugh
stated she knew I would be speaking with her. Radabaugh stated she
was first introduced to Epstein when she turned eighteen years old.
Radabaugh stated she was sure of her age as it was her senior year in
She advised she was brought there to
make money and was told she would have to provide a massage to this
Palm Beach guy. She remembered she met Epstein and his assistant
Sarah in the kitchen area. She stated she was taken by one of her
friends, Kara. She stated she went upstairs with Sarah while Epstein
got ready for the massage. He exited his bathroom naked and Radabaugh
turned around. Epstein asked her if being naked offended her.
Radabaugh stated it made her uncomfortable. Epstein then put ona
towel and lay on the table. Radabaugh stated she rubbed his back and
feet. She stated she had no massage training or experience.
Radabaugh stated during the massage, Epstein attempted to touch her
buttocks. Radabaugh pulled away as he touched her buttocks. She told
him again she was uncomfortable with him touching her. Epstein then
cut the massage short and became upset with her. Epstein paid her
$200.00 for the massage and told her to leave the house. Radabaugh
never returned to the house. She did advise of one time she went with
however she waited in the car for aaa: sne did not
want to go into the house. At the conclusion of visit with
Epstein they left the area. Radabaugh stated she had heard from other
girls that have gone to the house that Epstein now required them to do
the massage naked and allow him to touch them in their private areas
for monies. The interview was concluded as Radabaugh did not have any
other information to provide.

I then learned from the original victim, [JJthe defense attorney had
learned of her identity. I spoke with the father of the victim, who
stated there has been a private investigator on his house
photographing his family and chasing visitors who come to the house.
He provided a Florida License of E79-4EH. This vehicle is registered
to Ivan Robles of West Palm Beach. Robles is a private investigator
intern who is licensed by the state. I informed the State Attorney's
Office of the above information.

I received the Grand Jury subpoenas to be delivered to three victims
for a Grand Jury session to be held on April 18, through April 20,
2006.

10, 2006, at approximately 2:30 p.m., I served AD at her residence in
Royal Palm Beach. The subpoena was given to her mother, TD.

I learned through one of the victims (AH) that she was personally
contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein.
The source assured [she would receive monetary compensation for her
assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. [J§Jalso stated
she was told, "Those who help him will be compensated and those who
hurt him will be dealt with." I told Jthat tampering with a
witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her
who approached her during this encounter. [§§Joriginally was reluctant
to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not
to testify because she felt they were still friends.

On April 11, 2006, Det Dawson and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida
and met with the victim, QMMfidentified Brittany Beal, W/F,
02/01/1987, as the person who approached her in Royal Palm Beach while
she was home during Spring Break in March 2006. [§Jalso stated she
did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on Beal. [jwas
concerned that the defense attorney was given a copy of the report as
certain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by

Beal. Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her
subpoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18,
2006.

Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's
Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the
subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I
spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by
the defense. .

On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several
occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am
and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic
for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State
Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury.

At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and
located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic in their offices. I entered ASA
Belohlavic's office who informed me that she was going to return my
call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy
Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg
Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with
adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to
psychiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors.
When asked about the all the other victims, ASA Belohlavic stated
that was the only offer made as to one victim, Asa Belohlavic
cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail
and played the message on speaker. The caller identified himself as

Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them.
Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey
Epstein, and agreed to the deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand
jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable
cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let
me know as to when it would be needed. I explained my disapproval of
the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered.
However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval
would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief
Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and
returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the
deal offered.

I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from
stepmother for the victim JJ She was calling because the State
Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when
they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office
and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and
explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done.

On April 17, 2006, at approximately 4:30 pm, State Attorney
Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the
cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims
that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I
advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on
the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the
Grand Jury that I felt it was the States Attorney's Office
responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason
they were no longer needed.

NOTES /COMMENTS;

Jeffrey,
Attached is a schedule comparing the valuc of the Managed Properties as of 1/1/2002 ani!
the estimated value as of 12/31/2004, including the calculation of the Performance Fee.

Regarding your request for the value of the Exchaded Properties as of 1/1/2002, the E&'”
appraisal done in 2001 only inchided “Managed Properties”. Approximately 1,000 acres wes':
not inchided im the E & Y appraisal because they were identified before the appraisal 2:
Excluded Properties. In addition, a significant portion of the acres (approximately 100()1
included in the appraisal were transferred to Excluded Properties before the Beginning Valu:
was finalized. If you would like me to prepare an estimate the value of the Exclndei!
Properties as of 1/1/2002 please let me know.

Regards,

Fe

Subject: [Fwd: [Fwd: Re: contract]] “

Ed,

We're working with Merrill Lynch investment bank and Delta to raise $50

million by selling at a discount the first $600 million worth of jet

fuel from our production schedule. The $600 million will have an

opportunity to be re-invested for equity in the fuel facility to create

an opportunity for additional earnings at the investor's option.

Assuming we get a 3:1 multiplier in this second round, the $50 million

could conceievably net the investors $1.8 billion in less than 3 years.

We're looking at 10 shares of $5 million each - its all spelled out in %
the enclosed literature.

Let me know if there is any interest by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone you
know, Let me know what you need from me to help make this happen.
Where possible -and necessary- we have acreed to pay finders fees that
are convertible to share interest.

Once we have the $50 million we'll move the program past feasability to

the point where project financing is possible. The Delta contract is @
worth nearly $18 billion. The value of the jet fuel produced by the

instaliation once complete will be around $60 billion - assuming a 20

year life.

Thanks. 2

MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded
from just making an objection to the form of the
question. As the courts well know, and if you
practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the
judges require you to set the objection with
specificity. And I will do that. And if you
don't want me to, you can make the record. But I |
will do that.

MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You
can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to |

form for every single one of my questions.

Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing.

obstruct.

There's a recorder here. I'm certainly not being

professionalism, hopefully, by all parties in the

| shared your latest email with Mr. McAuliffe and we both agree that it is our position that he needs to honor his
commitment and complete his community control as agreed. If you feel it necessary to file a motion to modify or
early terminate on behalf of your client just let me know so | can have enough time to get the Det. and victims
notified so they can appear for the hearing. Thanks!

It is obvious you have spent a lot of time on my request for my client and! sincerely appreciate the
thoroughness and the attention. As my clients case seems to lend itself to misunderstandings and
miscommunications by others, | thought it important to clarify some facts assumed in error.

| have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the following: Yes termination of supervision ona
sex offender is unusual, however a modification to probation from Community control is not uncommon when
the probationer has been in compliance without violation. In fact the department's current policy on re-entry
to the community dictates that an offender be stepped down as soon as possible. He was also under the
misimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein’s charges called for sex offender probation. They do
not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues in my clients case, sterile questions that may
have been asked tend to lead to answers that though well meaning are not applicable.

As for the timeliness of the police reports of the attempted breakins, | wanted you to be aware that | confirmed
with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to the captain on duty, there should be a
record. | said to you it was my advice to the client that he not file a formal report.

You have suggested that to resolve all the issues my client move to transfer his community control and that
your office would support his transfer. | appreciate that and spoke to Mr. Gaines about that and he doesn’t
believe that would be possible to New York. Mr. Gaines suggested an agreement to allow Mr. Epstein to travel
for business purposes without the present 48 hour limitation but strictly at the discretion and with the
approval of probation for the remaining short portion of his supervision would be appropriate. He advised me
that the department would not object to such a modification. This to me is the fairest way to deal with the
issues, and to insure Mr. Epstein is treated like others, Let me know and I can prepare some proposed
language that | think would work for everyone

This dragon just keeps raising its ugly head! May I tell him to just file his motion to
modify with the Court? I don’t know how to convey to him anymore than I already have that
his client is a registered sex offender that was fortunate to get the deal of the century,
fortunate enough, even as a sex offender, to be granted work release while serving his
jail sentences (I am not aware of that ever happening before) and certainly fortunate to
plea at a time when it was not required by statute that he be placed on sex offender
probation with all of the restrictive conditions that the vast majority of individuals in
his similar situation would have been subjected to. Please advise.

this person who was dressed in black like a Ninja and hiding in some bushes. They chased him to a dark
Chrysler 300 and took down the tag info. From there they were able to find out that it was registered to a Pl that
has been associated/linked to Atty. Rothstein and the Gambino family. | spoke with DOC Community Control
Supervisor, Ofc. Gaines, and he advised me that late last week Epstein informed him of a similar incident. Ofc.
Gaines went on to say that he spoke with Epstein in late Sept. or possibly Oct. of last year and explained to him
that he received “the best deal ever heard of for someone in his situation” and that he warned him to follow every
condition by the letter so as not to get violated. If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which
would be even more of a restriction to him.

Re: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8 % yrs. of
doing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no known case where a Sex Offender on
Community Control has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or
DOC. There have been rare instances where a person who has been on a very long probation has been given
early termination of probation after serving a considerable number of years on probation.

Re: The position of the U.S. Attorney’s office on early termination of the State’s case against Epstein, | again
spoke with AUSA Villafana and inquired specifically of any knowledge that she had in reference to
representations made by her or anyone associated with her office regarding Epstein’s efforts to early term his
Community Control on the State charges. She indicated that she had not made any such representations
however her boss, interim U.S. Atty. Sloman may have. After checking she sent me a portion of the last letter
sent to Epstein’s attorneys. | have forwarded that to you by attachment.

Please let me know if there is anything else that | can provide to you.

Hi Barbara — Here is the relevant portion of the last letter to JE’s attorneys regarding the termination of
supervision:

In light of Mr. Acosta’s prior statements to Mr. Epstein’s counsel that Mr. Epstein would be
eligible for any benefit available to other similarly-situated state defendants, the Office agrees that Mr.
Epstein may apply for early termination or modification of community control in accordance with Fl.
Stat. §§ 948.05 and 948.10(4), assuming that Mr. Epstein has completed “the sanctions imposed in the
community control plan.” The Office takes no position regarding such an application; it is entirely
within the discretion of the State Attorney’s Office and the Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge as to
whether it is in “the best interests of justice and the welfare of society” to allow Mr. Epstein to
terminate prematurely his community control. Mr. Epstein and his counsel may_not make a

RE: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein
Case No. 2008CF009381A

Dear Barbara,

Pursuant to our telephone conversation of November 30, 2009 and your subsequent email
to me, | am providing the following information to you concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s air travel
from May 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009.

As you know, Mr. Epstein was in the custody of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office
until July 22, 2009. | have confirmed that since Mr. Epstein’s release from custody, he has
traveled twice by air. The first trip was on September 14, 2009 when he traveled by
helicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach
County by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only
other passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by
probation. On August 27, 2009 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to
Sikorsky Helicanters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova
accompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of
transportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights
taken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the
helicopter but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another
document confirming the September 14, 2009 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. | am
also enclosing documents for the August 27, 2009 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.

On another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State
Attorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of
nis probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with
probation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. | note that many
of the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scott Rothstein law

firm which has since filed bankruptcy as a result of massive fraud by one of its partners.
It is alleged that they used their civil cases filed against Mr. Epstein as one of their more
lucrative devices to perpetrate this fraud. Based on what I have learned and read, there
have been false filings, forged judge’s signatures, and forged Eleventh Circuit Opinions.
Itis also possible that other third parties have engaged in this conduct by falsely alleging
Mr. Epstein has violated the terms of his probation.

With this in mind, It appears that Mr. Epstein could be a victim of fabricated attacks
designed to do nothing more than question his compliance with his probation and
community control requirements. | truly want my client, as | am sure you do, to complete
his probation without continued false accusations being made against him. | would
suggest a meeting so we may discuss these problems. Given the fact that false

accusations are being made against my client, | would take the unusual step of producing
my client for such a meeting if you think it would be helpful.

Please give me a call with your thoughts on this and whether those documents satisfy your
request.

Re: BB, v. JEFFREY EPSTEIN
OUR FILE NO,: 080303

Dear Ms. Hackett,

As we discussed, I have agreed to cancel the deposition of ASA Daliah Weiss at this time.
Based on the conversations with Ms. Weiss and you, I do not foresee the need at this time to
reset this deposition, but I cannot completely foreclose the possibility of deposition in the future
pending further discovery in the Epstein cases. As | mentioned to you, if [ believe there is
additional information that develops in these cases that would require me to reset Mrs. Weiss for
deposition, I will provide you with notice prior resetting this deposition so that you will have an
opportunity to address the court in 4 timely manner.

Should you have any additiona] questions please do not hesitate to contact me at your
convenience.

Dear Lanna Belohlavek,

I am at a lost fur words, and trying to hold the tears back, after reading about the
sickening details of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s case. I have to say in this instance, your
office along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not
adequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and
prestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He
lived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the
corrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be
facing the death penalty. How can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of
girls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and now be a free man?! How?!! Because he is
rich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these
girls makes me sick. Now, I understand the pressure of taking on a powerful person with
unlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is better than
none can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor
did you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your
office could have put this monster away for at least 20 years, if not life.

I’m sure you have read Conchitta Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this
monsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as
a cautionary tale on how not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Now,
I do not know the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, how much hush’
money was paid out, ect ect. But I do know that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have
raped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn’t be allowed to do the
same thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you
legally could have to put this man in prison. However after researching the case, it seems
you failed to come down with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s
office and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!
It would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the
justice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose
to defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your little sister
or daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American
people deserve better, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the
anger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the
whole DA’s office nee“ to know this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!

On 08/21/09 I was assigned to obtain copies of the security
cameras and log in sheets for 1 Clearlake Plaza in West Palm
Beach, FL which is the business address for Jeffrey Epstein. On
08/21/09 I received the copies of the log in sheet and noted that
Mr. Epstein’s name does not appear on the log in sheet which he
would only be required to do if he were in the building after
1900 per the Property Manager, Mrs. Michelle Horn.

On 08/24/09 I received the security camera videos which were
formatted to DVD. I could not discern Mr. Epstein on the CD’s but
the camera angle is poor and does not allow one to see the entire
area, just the door area.

The DVD’s and Log In Sheets were TOT ASA Burns per her
request.

MEMORANDUM

TO: The File

VIA: Direct

FROM: Capt. George Frick

RE: Jeffrey Epstein 7
DATE: 08/20/09

On 8/19/09, at approximately 1635 hours, | was advised that Jeffrey Epstein was
walking northbound on South Ocean Blvd in the area of Brazilian Avenue. Based on
my prior conversations with Probation Supervisor Gladstone, | made contact with him to
discuss the possibility that this was a violation of Epstein’s order of community control.

| made contact with Gladstone who advised in his opinion that this was a violation and
that based on FSS 948.06, we should arrested Epstein. | advised Gladstone that |
needed a copy of his Order of Community Control in hand prior to making this arrest.
At 1642, this order was e-mailed to my office computer. | reviewed and printed the
order and responded to the area. At approximately 1653, | observed Epstein walking
southbound on South Ocean Blvd near the intersection of Barton Avenue. At 1655 |
requested a marked unit respond to Clarke Avenue and South Ocean Blvd as | was
making contact with Epstein. Epstein was wearing dark sweat pants and a white t-shirt.
He was sweating profusely. As he approached, | identified myself and began my on-
scene investigation. This was documented in the CAD system, CAD #092310146,
attached.

At that time, Epstein advised that his probation officer, Carmen Sloan, had advised him
he was allowed to walk to and from work, and that he was now en-route to work. He
further advised that his work address was on Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach. |
questioned Epstein as to why he was not on a direct route to his work, and why he was
now walking south when he had just been walking north. He stated that he had walked
to the area of the North Bridge, but considered it too busy, therefore he was returning to
the Middle Bridge to cross into West Palm Beach.

On 08/21/09 I was assigned to obtain copies of the security
cameras and log in sheets for 1 Clearlake Plaza in West Palm
Beach, FL which is the business address for Jeffrey Epstein. On
08/21/09 I received the copies of the log in sheet and noted that
Mr. Epstein’s name does not appear on the log in sheet which he
would only be required to do if he were in the building after
1900 per the Property Manager, Mrs. Michelle Horn.

On 08/24/09 I received the security camera videos which were
formatted to DVD. I could not discern Mr. Epstein on the CD’s but
the camera angle is poor and does not allow one to see the entire
area, just the door area.

The DVD’s and Log In Sheets were TOT ASA Burns per her
request.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
MEMORANDUM

DATE: December 20, 2006

FROM: Gerald B. Lefcourt

Sheryl E. Reich
Faith A. Friedman

TO: Jeffrey Epstein
FILE

SUBJECT: Impeachment Material

Set forth below is some of the information that demonstrates (a) that the Palm
Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) made a materially incomplete and materially
inaccurate presentation of the facts in both the probable cause affidavit and in its release
to the public of the Police Reports, and (b) why the State Attorney’s decision to proceed
as it did with respect to the bringing of any charges against Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”)
was not inappropriate.’ Note, though the Police Reports are on various dates, since they
were released to the public with continuous pagination, we refer here simply to the
“Police Report” and use the numbering provided in the version disclosed to the public.

I. Inaccuracies and Material Omissions from the Police Reports

1. Polygraph Examination and Report. On May 2, 2006, Epstein submitted to
a polygraph examination in which he was asked (a) whether he had “s
contact with (b) whether he “in anyway threaten[ed]

fF (c) whether he was told by “that she was 18 years
old”; and (d) whether he “believed was 18 years old”. As set
forth in the Report of the examination, the term “sexual contact” was given an

extremely broad meaning in order to capture any inappropriate conduct that
could have occurred.’ The results of the examination confirmed that (a) no
such conduct occurred; (b) Epstein never threatened J (c)
told Epstein she was 18 years old; and (d) Epstein believed

was

* This memo is not exhaustive of facts of which the defense is aware. Nor is it exhaustive of
Epstein’s defenses to the accusations.

* The definition included: “sexual intercourse, oral sex acts (penis in mouth or mouth on vagina),
finger penetration of the vagina, finger penetration of the anus, touching of the vagina for sexual
gratification purposes, touching of the penis for sexual gratification purposes, masturbation by or
to another, touching or rubbing of the breasts, or any other physical contact involving sexual
thoughts and/or desires with another person”.

years old. Though the results of the examination were given to the PBPD and
the PBPD was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner in
order to satisfy itself as to the bona fides of the exam, representatives of the
PBPD inexplicably declined to attend the meeting and no information
concerning the fact of the exam or the results appeared in the Police Report;
the probable cause affidavit; or the public release.

Meetings with the State Attorney’s Office. On multiple occasions, defense

counsel met with prosecutors and investigators in the State Attomney’s Office.
Though there is vague reference to one or more meetings with defense counsel
(see, e.g., pages 64 and 87 of the Police Report), virtually no information
provided or evidence from witnesses proffered is included in the Police
Report or probable cause affidavit. Instead, there are misleading or false
references to such meetings. So, for example, at page 64 of the Police Report,
Det. Recarey claims he attempted to reach ASA Dahlia Weiss on December
20, 2005, but she was unavailable that day and for the entire week. In fact, on
December 19, 2005, Det. Recarey met with ASA Weiss and Epstein defense
attorney Alan Dershowitz ~ a meeting at which Dershowitz provided evidence
impeaching SME (see below). This evidence included excerpts
from MySpace.com webpage, which is not only unnoted in the Police
Report, but credited as having been found by Det. Recarey. (Police Report at
page 65.) In another example, the briefest reference is made to a conversation
Det. Recarey had on June 1, 2006, with ASA Belohlavek regarding a meeting
earlier that day between representatives of the State Attorney’s Office and
defense attorney Jack Goldberger (Police Report at page 87). Omitted are the
tacts of the meeting (Report at 87): In addition to the presence of other
defense counsel, there was in attendance both the polygraph expert who
administered the examination and a psychiatrist who had performed a rigorous
psycho-sexual evaluation of Epstein and who concluded that Epstein was
healthy. Both men were made available for questioning by the State Attorney
and the PBPD; unfortunately, the PBPD failed to attend the meeting. Nor is
there any mention of the presentation made by defense counsel in which the
claims being made with respect ‘A oy then, the sole focus of
any potential prosecution) were rebutted.

The Video Surveillance Equipment Located in Epstein’s Office and
Garage, Both the Police Report (page 43) and the probable cause affidavit
(page 18) make particular mention of the PBPD having “discovered” video
surveillance equipment, or “covert (hidden) cameras” (as the PBPD refers to
them), at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, specifically in Epstein’s garage and
library/office. By its placement in the probable cause affidavit, it is clear that
the reader is intended to assume a link between this equipment and “sex
objects” and that the cameras were used for an improper purpose. As the
probable cause affidavit states: Det. Recarey “located a wood colored armoire
beside Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of ‘joy jelly’, which is used to
provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the
second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s
bedroom...” Indeed, much is made of the presence of this equipment, noting

----------------------------------------
that it captured images of :: others. (See probable cause
affidavit at page 18). In particular, the probable cause affidavit notes that “on

the first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [was] found two covert cameras
hidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the
library area behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was
reviewed which showed several images of J and other witnesses
interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera
positioned behind Epstein’s desk”. (/d.) Omitted from the Police Report and
the probable cause affidavit is the fact that the PBPD had known since 2003
about the presence of the cameras, and the specific reason for their installation.
The cameras were installed in 2003 after Epstein discovered that large sums of
cash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras
installed at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided
equipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the installation of the
equipment Epstein purchased. The cameras ultimately served their purpose
and captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from
Epstein’s briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of
Alessi was turned over to the PBPD — indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The
characterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as
playing a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein’s home (even though
none of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever
placed any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading
and suggests an intention to portray the facts to suit a particular goal.

Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash. The Police Report details police
finding in Epstein’s trash what is described as pieces of “sex toys” and that
these “discoveries” purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omitted from
both the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is the fact that during
the course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the police
realized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the broken handle of a salad server.
Though the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable
cause affidavit, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery
of this new and highly relevant evidence.

Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other
exculpatory and impeaching evidence known by the PBPD was omitted from
the Police Report and probable cause affidavit by, in our view, manipulating
the date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police
Report (at page 85), Det. Recarey “explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the
PBPD had concluded its case in December of 2005”. That assertion, which is
false, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced
subsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains
information obtained after December 2005, the PBPD escaped having to
consider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause affidavit,
or what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence
presented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December
2005. That evidence is listed below.

Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses
Relied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits.

Virtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable
cause affidavit has a background that casts significant doubt on whether the
witness is sufficiently credible to support a finding of probable cause, let alone to
sustain what would be the State’s burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the
witnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which
undercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence
was submitted to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the
probable cause affidavit, or released to the public. Below we address solely the
omitted criminal histories. Following that, we list other factors that make each
witness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at
trial — all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omitted from the
Police Report, the probable cause affidavit and the public disclosure.

6. Juan Alessi: While the Police Report (at page 57) and the probable cause
affidavit (at page 21) contain assertions by Alessi which allegedly support the
bringing of criminal charges, omitted is the evidence revealing Alessi’s
evident mental instability; prior criminal conduct against Epstein; and bias
towards Epstein. As the PBPD well knew, in 2003, Alessi was filmed taking
money from Epstein’s home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully
entering Epstein’s home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admitted to
the PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,
stealing cash and attempting to steal Epstein’s licensed handgun (which in fact
went missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report
detailing Alessi’s confession. Also known to the PBPD, but omitted from the
Police Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to
kill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination
of credibility, and was specifically known to Det. Recarey at the time the
Police Report and probable cause affidavits were written, it was omitted.

7. While the Police Report and probable cause affidavit rely
on statements of the father of omitted is
evidence, known to the PBPD, that casts doubt on credibility and

sustainability as a witness. Omitted from the Police Report and probable
cause affidavit is [Federal fraud conviction, which defense
investigators discovered and turned over to the PBPD during the course of the
investigation. erved 21 months in federal prison for his offense.

8. While the Police Report and probable cause affidavit rely on
statements of the step-mother of PI omitted is

evidence, known to the PBPD that casts doubt on her credibility. Omitted
from the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is state
conviction for identity fraud — criminal use of identification information. This
information, uncovered by defense investigators, was also turned over to the
PBPD during the course of the investigation.

9. was the source of the vast majority of the
allegations made about Epstein. While the Police Report and probable cause
affidavit rely on [J numerous assertions, all but omitted is any reference to
the facts known about her by the PBPD, specifically, that at the time
making these assertions

10. ile the Police Report and probable cause affidavit

contain numerous assertions of omitted is reference to her
long history of contacts with law enforcement. Among those are multiple
runaway complaints by her parents and her assignment to a special high
school for drug abusers.

In addition to the prior criminal history of each of these critical witnesses, all of
which was omitted from the Police Report and probable cause affidavit, significant
additional material information concerning the credibility of these key witnesses was
provided to the PBPD but never included in the Police Report, the probable cause
affidavit or the public release.

11.

“came forward” (as the probable
cause affidavit characterizes it at pages 10-11), claiming she had knowledge
of “sexual activity taking place” at Epstein’s residence and misconduct by
Epstein. Thus, it becomes clear that bssertions of misconduct by
Epstein were likely motivated by a strong desire to avoid the repercussions of
her , Which should have been taken into account when
assessing her credibility as a witness.

12. Pn Was 18 at the Time She Inaccurately Alleges to Have
Engaged in Sexual Conduct with Epstein. Epstein denies he ever had sex
with HJ However, even if he did, irrefutable evidence, in the form of a
credit card receipt, was presented to the PBPD and the State Attorney’s Office
which demonstrates that any such encounters occurred at a time when
was already 18 years of age. (Indeed, it is our understanding that it was this
information, combined with the character and credibility problems presented
by the facts noted herein, that led the State Attorney’s Office to conclude that

cr neither credible nor a proper complainant.) This information, though
own to the PBPD, was omitted from the Police Report, the probable cause
affidavit and the public release.

approached, MMMM‘pulled out a pair of black SLT panties that had the sensor

up”. Following an internal investigation, which disclosed additional thefts
from both the store and a customer, she was fired. (In addition to the theft
above, she was seen by co-workers with store merchandise in her car; she was
believed to have engaged in a fraudulent “return scheme”; and she obtained a
pair of shoes from another store in the same mall by exchanging them for a
pair of just purchased men’s shoes inadvertently left behind by a customer).
In a recorded interview by a Loss Prevention manager, admitted to
merchandise theft of $209 [and asserted] “that her reason for stealing was that
she understood she was not getting paid enough and was struggling

Juan Alessi

Juan Alessi Admitted Burglariziny Epstein’s Home and Mental Health
Issues. As touched on above, in 2003, Epstein noticed that significant
amounts of cash were missing from his Palm Beach residence. In an effort to
identify the thief, Epstein had video surveillance equipment installed in the
library/office and garage. Caught on tape was former employee Juan Alessi
breaking in and stealing cash. The video evidence was turned over to none
other than PBPD Det. Recarey. After being confronted, Alessi admitted to
that break-in and claimed he was suicidal and wanted to steal a gun (which
Epstein maintained a license and permit for) with which he could kill himself.
He took cash instead. However, Alessi also admitted that he had repeatedly
entered the home unlawfully in order to steal money. Although these facts
were known to the PBPD, and in particular by Det. Recarey, Alessi’s criminal
history and evident mental instability were not included in the Police Report

occurred on the bed, no evidence concerning Alessi’s motive to lie, his

need a signed non-prosecution agreement (between the defense and us) by tomorrow afternoon, and an agreement

JEFFREY EPSTEIN

Jeffrey Epstein is a person who, having been raised in modest, lower middle
class circumstances in New York City, parlayed an aptitude for Mathematics, a
teaching experience in a private school, and a chance referral to a Wall Street
executive into a unique, niche business to the wealthy which in turn has made him a
wealthy person. While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is
hardly the measure of the man. To those who have known him long or intimately, he is
a loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the
scientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his
largesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most
importantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary
citizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding
person, mentor, and friend. .

Personal History

Jeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in
1953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was
raised in modest lower middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish
neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City
Parks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in
high school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:
his youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment
from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a
normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.

Jeffrey attended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident
early on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. 188 and was subsequently placed in a special
program which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High
School. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayette High
School in 1969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey
attended Cooper Union in Manhattan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.
Jeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York
University. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for

spending money.

----------------------------------------
Around 1974, Jeffrey decided to try his hand at teaching and obtained a teaching
position in mathematics with an annual salary of $12,000 at the Dalton School, a highly
respected private school in uptown Manhattan which caters to the wealthy. Children in
his classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of
wealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been
exposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and
uniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As
matters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-
altering on a number of different jevels.

As Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to attend an art
gallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached
by a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially
talented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working
on Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even know where Wall Street
was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.
During his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admitted that he did not
know what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea
change in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively
based valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a
job on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.

Jeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,
and came to know a number of successful investors. His success in the position is
reflected in the fact that by 1980 he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.
Believing, however, that he could do better on his own on the outside, he decided to
resign from Bear Stearns in 1981. Capitalizing on his knowledge of and experience
investing in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to
the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience
at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &
Company (now Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the
“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice (on

investment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the

client’s family office. The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:
extreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,
ic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied
families possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,
insulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members
affected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential
clients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues
in this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s
business and personal interests currently employ approximately 160 people. Of these,
however, he is the only income-producing person.

Jeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied
away from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allow him
the kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey
has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from 1981 to 1990,
and the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from 1991 to 2000. (These will be treated in
greater detail below.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West
Palm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he
was enrolled as a visiting fellow at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

Jeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He
has preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy
and well-known people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2005, Jeffrey agreed to
accompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to
Africa. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that
it did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and

otherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.

‘Jeffrey offered the following example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the
difficulty of knowing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is
called for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the
implicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,
however, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur
and absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.

Personal Characteristics

Friendships. Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close
relationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of
these friends attest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always
accorded them.

Kathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follows:

It’s difficult to express how much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me
over the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian
angel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the
stresses of his own work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to
me with gentleness, wisdom and humor.

I've watched Jeffrey grow from boyhood into one of the hardest working,
responsible, and generous men I know. For instance, when the time came
to send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible
education but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I
couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood
how much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the
costs of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from
Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible
without Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.

Terry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has known Jeffrey since
1958, wrote:

From the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was
always in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently
call upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he
was doing to listen and help... .

I am aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.
that he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of
which are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can attest that he
is also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when
he spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my 19 year old son Philip
to help him sort out academic problems he was having.
Warren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from
Jeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,

including the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer

breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which attests to the playful side of

Jeffrey’s nature:

In high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were
Jokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just
didn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed
teacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were
“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing
grade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it
was too late. After 10 minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff
convinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until
graduation. Weill, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class
every day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the
class did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we
graduated.

Eisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the

following words:

Over the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success
unattainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No matter how busy he ever is, no
matter where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,
he was always there. As we’ve gotten older, our lives have become more
complicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our
birthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but how many childhood friends do you
know, who have never forgotten your birthday? The most important thing
to me is that as vast a difference [as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep
seated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;
it’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even
family. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only
ones who could comprehend this special relationship.

Jeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his
adulthood. In about 1981, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (now Andersson-Dubin), then 20,
who was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still
enduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.
During that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He
encouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She
reported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with
her studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to
cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and

presently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.

----------------------------------------
When it became clear, however, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not
include staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no
future as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three
children. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly
every day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so
in the 26 years they have known each other. She described their current relationship as
follows:

Today [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is
the godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as
well. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the
evening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and
conduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the
children’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational
games for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey
was extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could
not ask for a better friend or godfather to my children.

Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, 12. Celina wrote
glowingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time
from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science
and mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for
example, as why the sky is blue or how fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they
then spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing
voice (even though, as she knows, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this
area). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, however, by an

incident Celina related in her letter:

One of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2
years ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter
dance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I
didn’t know what I would do because you had to bring your father to the
dance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone
call to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than 10
minutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he
rushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.

After Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey

entered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning

in 1991, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of
her life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-known publisher, had been found dead
floating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers
were involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they
were eventually acquitted. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.

Ghislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship
immediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.
Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,
and he never allowed her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical
things he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies ~
containing issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the
process, take her outside of her personal concems. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to
comedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her
depression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen
into a deep depression.

Jeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her
get a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends
with his money is always with a view toward maintaining their dignity. He would never
just give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to
people he does not know, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to
give it back. These gifts are meant to allow the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey
finds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which
she subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.

Over time, their relationship became intimate. However, as with Eva, it ended
amicably around 2000 upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,
ie, the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,
precluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this
day. She wrote of their relationship:

My experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,
with a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and
values and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always
follow through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is

disciplined in business and conscientious. A man always quick to help

Generosity to Educational. Wellness, Civic and Scientific Organizations. Jeffrey

has been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scientific
organizations. Between 2000 and 2006 he donated personally, through his business and
interests, and through foundations he had established,” a total exceeding $16,000,000.
The good generated by his largesse is suggested in the following examples.

Jeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps
none more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish
community at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and
religious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when
Henry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach

Jeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:

At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift
would allow him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a
tempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity
and the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,
but in essence this is what happened.

Jeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly
did not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also
participate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had
decided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on
the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a
long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion
and greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor
but without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no
building. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no
new building and that would have been an enormous loss to the

community.

The building that now stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-
Radcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a
noteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his

gifts to be anonymous. Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the
spotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.

Jeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the
Institute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe
haven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such
places as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors
over the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the
Stockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were
the original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program
designed to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,
courage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of
endeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s
generosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former
President Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the
room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate
degree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton
Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New
York where they are expected to graduate in 2008.

Jeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness
organizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer
Research Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the
Continuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and
the Center for Health and Healing.

Jeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in
both New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a
major contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in
New York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty
fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money
to literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,
sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and

women’s groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which

in 2005 recognized Jeffrey’s generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to attend
the school who otherwise would not have been able to.

Perhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey’s philanthropy is his no-strings attached
support of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting “bleeding edge” research.
As previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in mathematics and science,
and is particularly attracted to research which focuses on the mathematical foundation of
life. By his own admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of
such research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research
financially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example
of this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist
who predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at
the institute on what has become known as Chaos Theory.

Another particular example is Martin A. Nowak, Ph.D., Director of the Program
for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nowak recently wrote:

Over the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,
which deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I
have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask
questions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my
scientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too
engaged in our own narrow perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and
proposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his
questions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For
example, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which
led me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that
topic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks
between people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new
field of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me
complicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from
chemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful
and completely new research project. ...

Jeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has
donated $500,000 to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where
I have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from 1998 until 2003. In
2003, Jeffrey donated $6,500,000 to Harvard University, where I work as
Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of
Mathematics and Biology. Both donations were meant to support my
basic research work without any strings attached.

Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that

a particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly
reflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is
quick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally
those who work for him and those he knows. Once he learns of and determines through
conversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,
treats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees
to it that, without strings attached, the solution happens. The issues may be
accommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family
problems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to better
himself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to
address the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this
capacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.

Examples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.

Indyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:

Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the
workman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-
in-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen
of Colombia and the workman did not have the financial resources or
know how to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey
arranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law
and sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit
to the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients
recovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.
Epstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the
high school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education
is now being funded by Mr. Epstein.

There have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for

employees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several

examples follow:

A father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently
diagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for
the father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and
complete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order
to fly to Florida to attend to the employee’s father.

Lesley Groff, a personal assistant to Jeffrey, reported a number of
accommodations Jeffrey has made, i.e., purchase of a vehicle for her
commute, extended maternity leave, a reduced work week and permission
to work from home, which have strengthened her family life.

Lauren Kwintner, another New York City-based employee, told of
accommodations from 2003 to 2005 that Jeffrey made for her to attend to
her father, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, at both
Sloane Kettering Memorial Hospital and subsequently the Hospital for
Joint Diseases, until his passing.

Bella Klein, also a New York City-based employee, was a single mother
whose son was accepted to Cornell University; Jeffrey has paid up to 70%
of his tuition expenses; the son now has his Master’s Degree and is
working on his Ph.D.

Harry Beller, a sixteen-year employee, is an orthodox Jew who is required
to be home prior to sundown on Fridays and on all Jewish holidays.
Jeffrey has always accommodated his religious commitments, on occasion
permitting pressing Friday transactions to take place on the following
Monday. Mr. Beller also told of Jeffrey’s assistance in making available
any of his contacts in the medical field and to take any necessary time off
when one of his sons was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.

Jeffrey has been especially generous in funding the educational pursuits of his
employees (and their family members) as a way of assisting them to better themselves
and achieve their full potential. Mr. Indyke has written that over the last six years,
Jeffrey has funded literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to many
individuals (some of whom Jeffrey has no connection with whatsoever) from the pre-
school to the post-graduate levels. Mr. Beller, mentioned above, for example, has been
the recipient of tuition assistance for all six of his children! Another employee, Emad
Hanna, who was hired by Jeffrey at a particularly trying time of his adult life, told of
Jeffrey’s sponsorship of his son’s AAU baseball team and of the tuition assistance for his
son:

Jeffrey Epstein has paid out of his pocket my son's high school tuition for
years now totaling around $20,000 and has given him the opportunity to
get a top notch education at a private all boys catholic high school and my
son has thrived in that environment and averaged a grade of 91 in his
freshmen (sic) year and from all the travel baseball experience he was
able to make the JV basebail team at one of the top schools in New Jersey.
This has paved the way for my son to possibly have the opportunity to

attend a college of his choice when the time comes. I would not have been
able to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.

Another example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is putting
through vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke
related that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and

mentor Mr. Diaz.
A final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:

While working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a
relationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo
and I reflect life’s issues and family matters as best fas] a Colombian and
English speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture
speaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken
English and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter attending
college. Alfredo told me how proud he is of her attending college. “Me
daughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which
led to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,
Mister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to
me he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the
dream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such
consequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one
man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is
aware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without
thought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's
crisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.

Jeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to
face and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings
the same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and
generosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke

faced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:

Shortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and
unexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned
that I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional
manner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to
undergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we
could not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s
medical insurance.

I meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop
my wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a

----------------------------------------
different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally
asked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a
moment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the
bills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his
generosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing
news.

In the days and weeks that followed, Jeffrey personally researched
infertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He
identified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were
seeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the
progress of our treatment cycle.

Unfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I
were hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at
his expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be
terminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were
devastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,
support and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and
my wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me
to go over my wife’s and my options, which now included in-vitro
fertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not
blink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we
were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private
adoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,
while we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.

At the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption
attempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to
continue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we
would not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,
to meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas
adoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after
our fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters, Although
Jeffrey was adamant that we owed him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by
agreeing to be the godfather of our children.

The bottom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably
successfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous
human being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but
has been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,
educational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,

and civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them

address life problems and reach their potential; to enable educational, wellness, and civic
organizations to better achieve their respective purposes; and, to foster the kind of
scientific research which might potentially benefit all of mankind. Finally, in his
generosity, Jeffrey has sought nothing for himself. To the extent it is possible, his giving
has always been anonymous; when this has not been possible, it is clear that he does not

seek the spotlight for these acts.
