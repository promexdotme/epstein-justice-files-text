Inmate Death at the MCC New York 
New York, NY: On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:30 a.m., inmate Jeffrey 
Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent 
suicide at the Metropolitan Conectional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Life-saving 
measures were initiated immediately by responding staff. Staff requested emergency medical 
services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local 
hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital 
staff. The FBI is investigating the incident. 
Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under 
pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. 
MCC New York is an Administrative security facility that currently houses 763 male offenders 
in New York, New York.

Hi, I know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details I see out there: 
was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cell mate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be 
housed alone in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated 
the jai la€™s normal procedure, two officials said.

Can the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC?

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday witf>>(6) (b)(J)(C) 
IMr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Officet
~~~~c, ~old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use t he bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant~~~~~ic, I Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal.

Hi Darrinkb)(5)

At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the 
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge 
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the 
government and defense counsel a chance to speak. 
[0)(5) 
Page 789 

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked 
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent 
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is 
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't 
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SONY J. Sullivan) 
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense 
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a 
particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also 
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel 
obviously didn't know that Adam & I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go 
to SHU.) 
Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most 
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they 
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so. 
The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. 
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC 
with the judge presiding over their case. 
Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the 
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at 
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court 
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's 
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice. 
At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and 
ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the 
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion. 
Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any 
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to 
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me. 
Thanks,

~~?~c, lold my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant~ ~?;c~r Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not 
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the 
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Epstein status hearing 
Attachments: 
TEXT.htm 
At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the 
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge 
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the 
government and defense counsel a chance to speak. 
[b)(5) 
Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked 
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent 
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is 
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't 
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SONY J. Sullivan) 
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense 
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a 
particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also 
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel 
obviously didn't know that Adam & I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go 
to SHU.) 
Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most 
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they 
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so. 
Page 1235 

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. 
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC 
with the judge presiding over their case. 
Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the 
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at 
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court 
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's 
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice. 
At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and 
ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the 
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion. 
Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any 
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to 
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and 
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Fnday w1thp>><6); (b)(7)(C)

allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Officert~~6k. ~old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant~gr~~< ~r Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in t he client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Good morningfb)(6): (b)(7)(C) 
I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday with~bX6>; (b)(7)(C) 
~nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Officer~~!~?;c, ~old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenan1R:~~?i"~r Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help. 
Sincerely, 
b)(6)· (b){7)(C)

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by~bX6); (b)(7)(C) I Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an imnate who suffers from a mental illness, a 
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug 
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. 
The inmate is no longer 
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the 
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Irunates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates 
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm 
or engaged in self-banning behavior), but rather, due to his/her impainnent in mental status or 
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her 
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary 
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to 
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or 
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the 
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

come or unless he sees a memo from LiutenantKb/~/ .. lor Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines

Good afternoon all, 
Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are 
requesting: 
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits; 
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and 
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference. 
Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning Mr. Johnson, 
I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday with~ X5); (b)(7)(C) 
bnd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Officerf~~~~~n ltold my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from LiutenantK~~~1·. ~r Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help. 
Sincerely, 
[b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

Good afternoon Mr.KbX6>;_ 
Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not 
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the 
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Funds found in an institution that cannot be attributed to a specific inmate are delivered to the 
Accounting Section and deposited in accordance with the Program Statement Imprest Funds, 
Collections, and Deposits. 
8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES' FUNDS 
If an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be 
distributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state. If the 
inmate dies with monies due from the United States. payment is not authorized except to a legal 
representative of the estate or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution of the state of 
domicile (most recent legal residence). 
a. Claims for Funds of Deceased Inmates. Claims received against funds of deceased inmates 
are handled at the institution level per 4 GAO 3500. Institutions should submit claims to the Trust 
Fund Branch Deposit Fund Section for GAO settlement only when doubt exists as to: 
■ The amount or validity of the claim. 
■ The person(s) properly entitled to payment under the laws of the domicile of the descendent. 
In such cases, the institution transmittal shall explain that doubt exists. and is accompanied by a 
Claim Against the United States for Amounts Due in the Case of A Deceased Creditor (SF-\ 055) 
and/or AcknowledgmenL of Inmate. Part 3 & 4 (BP-A0408) and a copy of the death certificate. 
If there is urgent need for payment of a balance under $100 in a deceased inmate· s account. and if 
conditions as outlined in the paragraph above are satisfied. the amount may be disbursed from 
TRU F ACS with the Trust Fund Branch Chiefs written approval. Copies of the BP-A0408 are 
attached to such vouchers in lieu of the usual withdrawal request. Documentation is attached to 
lhe payment in TRUF ACS through the document imaging process. 
b. Unclaimed Funds of Deceased Inmates. Procedures for processing ··whereabouts 
unknown .. inmates are followed when disposing unclaimed funds of deceased inmates with no 
relatives or claimanls for the funds. 
8.8 ENCUMBRANCE OF INMATE FUNDS 
Encumbrance of inmate funds for various reasons is essential. Careful consideration is given 
before any action; encumbrances arc not made indiscrim inately. An encumbrance may be made 
for various reasons (e.g. to ensure inmates do not seriously deplete their funds before release, 
disciplinary measures, inmate·s request, claims). Encumbrances are at the Warden's discretion or 
the result of a disciplinary hearing sanction or notification of a pending Federal court order. This 
authority is not delegated below the Associate Warden. Funds the Warden encumbers may only 
be released upon his/her approval or upon inmate release.

Epstein status hearing 
Attachments: 
TEXT.htm 
At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the 
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge 
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the 
government and defense counsel a chance to speak. 
b)(5) 
Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked 
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent 
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is 
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't 
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SONY J. Sullivan) 
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense 
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a 
particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also 
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel 
obviously didn't know that Adam & I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go 
to SHU.) 
Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most 
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they 
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so. 
Page 1785 

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. 
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC 
with the judge presiding over their case. 
Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the 
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at 
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court 
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's 
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice. 
At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and 
ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the 
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion. 
Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any 
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to 
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not 
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the 
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Good afternoon all, 
Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are 
requesting: 
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits; 
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and 
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference. 
Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday with~b)(fi); (b)(7)(C) 
~nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Office ~~~t .. , old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant~e?~?; br Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

My apologies, but I have been away from my desk in meetings the past three days. I received your voicemails regarding the status 
of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation continues, any personal property attributable to Mr. 
Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family 
as expeditiously as possible. 
If you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to chat further. 
Thank you,

Good afternoon all,

requesting:

2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and 
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference. 
Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not 
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the 
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

With apologies for the delay, medical staff can accept his CPAP machine. Would you or one of your 
associates be able to bring it in next week? It must be provided to medical staff rather than directly to your

Good morning Mr. g~~~ci 
I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday wittfb)(6), (b)(7)(C) 
~nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Officer~~~~?~c> ~old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenan0 bX6); br Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help. 
Sincerely,

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday witrfb)(6); (b)(7)CC) 
~nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Office~~~~~~c, ~old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant~~~Ux Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help. 
Sincerely, 
[b)(6); (b)(T)(C)

This must be provided 
every time a meeting is requested . 
Separation Orders : 
An inmate with a "separation order" is 
prohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or 
she is separated . 
Such a restriction would normally prevent a 
co- defendant meet ing . 
Ordinar i l y , t he request can be 
accommodated i f t he AUSA who p l aced t he separation order not ifies 
t he insti t ut ion t hat t he separati on does not appl y to co-
defendant meet ings . 
However , if t he inmates have been separat ed 
due to security concerns , whether based on information developed 
by an outside a gency or the Bureau of Prisons , MCC has the 
discretion to not allow the meeting . 
Attorneys who are aware of 
separation orders between co- defendants should include with the i r 
reques t t he name and phone number of t he AUSA ass i gned t o the 
case in question. 
These requests s hou l d be made as far in 
advance as poss i b l e, as t he meet ing will not be schedu l ed if t he 
responsibl e Assistant United States Attorney cannot be contacted . 
For co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from 
MCC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the 
responsibility of the defense attorney to contact the responsible 
Assistant Un i t ed States Attorney, who will , in t urn, contac t t he 
USMS t o arrange t ransportat ion of t he inmate . 
The Bureau of 
Prisons does not t ransport inmates for co- defendant meet i ngs .

B. Telephone Calls 
1 . 
Unmonitored Telephone Calls 
I nmate s may p l ace unmonitore d t e l ephone calls to t heir attorneys . 
See 28 C . F.R. §540 .10 5 ; a nd Program Statement 5264 . 07, Sec . 8, 
Te l ephone Regu l ations for I nmat es . 
All hous ing units , excl uding 
Special Hou sing Unit (SHU) , have access to unmonitored telephones 
with a direct c onnection t o the SONY Federal Public Defenders' 
Office . 
Some units also have unmonitored telephones with a 
direct connecti on t o t he EDNY Federal Public Defenders ' Offi ce . 
If the inmate ' s attorney cannot be contacted on the provided 
telephones , the inmate must specifically request Unit Team staff 
assistance in writing . 
The Unit Team staff will review the 
request , and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit 
Team's unmonitored t e l ephones . 
I n order t o receive a n 
unmonit ored attorney call, t he inmate or t he inmate ' s attorney 
must request Unit Team approva l , demonstrat ing t hat ot her 
correspondence , v i s i t ing , a nd normal te l ephone use i s inadequate . 
Inmate requests f or unmonitored attorney calls are carefully 
reviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected . 
Frequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate ' s 
opportunity to pursue i llegal act i v i t i es wi t hout detect i on . 
Additiona lly , staff time and attent ion is unfairly focused on the 
s ing l e inmate receiving numerous unmonitore d t e l ephone calls at 
t he expense of t he many ot her inmates on a casel oad . 
Page 10 of 22 

An attorney may not cal l an inmate . 
Attorneys who need to speak 
wi th an inmate and do not antici pate that the inmate will call 
them must visit the inmate in person or cont act the inmate by 
lett er . 
Similarly, attorneys may not fax documents t o inmates 
or to MCC New York staff for delivery t o inmat es . 
2 . 
I nmat es Te l ephone System (ITS) 
The Bureau of Pr i sons extends t e l ephone pri v i l eges to inmates as 
part of its overall correctional management strategy . 
See 28 
C. F . R. §540 . 100 , et seq . , Subpart I -
Telephone Regulations for 
Inmate ; and Program Statement 5264 . 07, Telephone Regulations for 
Inmates . 
Telephone privileges are a s upplemental means of 
maintaining community a nd family ties that may contribute to an 
inmate ' s persona l deve l opment . 
An inmate may request to call a 
person of his or her c hoice outside t he insti t ut i on on a 
t e l ep hone prov i ded for t hat p urpose . 
However , l i mi tat i ons and 
condi t ions may be imposed upon a n inmate ' s t e l ephone pri v i l eges 
to e nsure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau ' s correctional 
management responsibilities . 
In addition to the procedures set 
f orth in this s ubpart , inmate telephone u se is s ubject to those 
limitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure 
t he security or good order , inc l uding d i sci p l ine , of t he 
inst i t ut i on or to protect t he publ i c . 
Restri cti ons on inmate 
te l ep hone use may a l so be imposed as a d i scipl inary sancti on . 
See 28 C. F . R. Part 541 . 
Inmates must s ubmit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on 
their approved telephone list . 
Inmates can only call numbers 
p l aced on t heir approved te l ep hone l i st . 
Once a n inmate submi ts 
t he init i a l l ist , i t wi ll be processed as soon as poss i b l e . 
I nmat es may submi t addi t i onal te l ephone numbers once t hey are 
ass i gned a Correct i onal Counsel or or Case Manager from t he Un i t 
Team . 
Inmates are advised of the institution ' s telephone monitoring 
capability . 
See 28 C. F . R. §540 . 102 . 
A notice is posted next to 
each inmate te l ephone advi sing t hat calls are monitored . 
Ordinar i l y , calls are pai d for by t he inmate , bu t in some cases 
t he receiving par ty pays . 
See 28 C.F .R. §540 . 105. 
Third party , 
conference calls or use of two phones on t he same number, or 
other alternative call arrangements are not permitted, thus 
limiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for 
criminal or other inappropriate p urposes . 
Inmates who use the 
telephone improperly are s ubject to disciplinary actions which 
may resu l t in t he l oss of t e l ephone pri v i l eges, and in some cases 
crimina l c harges . 
I nmates may p l ace attorneys on t he i r approved te l ephone l i st . 
However, the calls are recorded and s ubject to monitoring . Such 
calls are not attorney- client privileged calls . 
Inmates seeking 
attorney- client privileged calls must request an unmonitored 
telephone call as described above in section B (l) . 
Page 11 of 22 

3 . 
Emergency Te l ephone Calls 
Inmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to a death 
or serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a 
request to the Religious Services Department. 
Likewise, if an 
individual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons , they 
s hou l d call t he main number and ask t o speak t o t he Re l i gious 
Services Department . 
C. Legal Mail 
All l egal mail must be addressed t o t he inmate . 
All mail 
addressed t o s taff on beha l f of an inmate wi ll be returned t o 
sender . 
I nmat es may not rece i ve documents v i a facsimi l e . 
1. 
Legal Mail Envel opes : 
The Bureau has established p rocedures by whi ch an inmat e may 
receive confidential legal mail . 
See 28 C. F . R. § 540 . 1 8; and 
Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 5800 . 10, Mail Management 
Manual ("PS 5800 . 10'' ). 
The Code of Federal Regulations provi des 
that special mail , which may only be op ened in the presence of 
t he inmate , wil l be treated as such " if t he sender is adequately 
i dentified on t he envelope, and t he front of the envelope i s 
marked ' Special Mail -
Open only in the presence of the 
inmate .'" 28 C.F.R. § 540 . 18(a) . 
However, the presence of a 
return address with a firm name does not suffi cientl y identify 
the sender of the material as an att orney . 
Specifically, the attorney must be adequatel y 
identified on the envelope as an attorney . 
The 
use of the t i t le "Esquire" wi t hout addi tional 
indi cation of the sender 's occupation does not 
est ablish the bearer as an attorney or l egal aid 
supervisor . 
Mail from ind i vidual s using t he tit l e 
"Esquire " as the exclus i ve identification of their 
status s ha l l not be handl ed as special mail , even if 
t he envel ope contai ns some special mail markings. 
P . S . 5800 .1 0 , Ch . 3, p .5 . 
To maint ain consistent handling of 
l egal mail, strict compl iance wi t h these procedures will be 
enforced by MCC New York mail room staff . 
To properly i dentify 
l egal mai l , counsel must write t hei r name (not j ust the firm's 
name) and their legal status (i . e . , attorney) , in the return 
address portion of t he envelope .

~?~t-, asked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. I 
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-
file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, I told defense 
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me 
they would get back to me. I haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release 
the funds?

Re: VM Epstein # 7 6318-054

~~~t- sked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. I 
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-
file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, I told defense 
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me 
they would get back to me. I haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release 
the funds? 
Thanks,

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (7 6318-054) informed me that he had a 
meeting last Friday wit}ib)(5);(bWXC) 
land Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told 
our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when 
meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officert ?~?:c, ltold my client and I that he would not be 
allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from 
Liutenant ~~~~r. or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. 
Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone 
calls. So far, no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with 
his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 
9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been 
eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

The Court will conduct a brief hearing on Tuesday, August 27, 2019 at 10:30 a.m. in 
co:rmection with the nolle prosequi order proposed to the Court on August 19, 2019 by the United 
States Attorney. 
The Court believes that where, as here, a defendant has died before any judgment has 
been entered against him, the public may still have an informational interest in the process by 
which the prosecutor seeks dismissal of an indictment. 
At the hearing, Counsel for the Government and for the deceased Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, will be heard. Counsel for the victims and the victims will also be heard, if they wish to 
be. 
The hearing will be held in Courtroom 17B.

I can help you. 
I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black 
college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are 
not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for 
"The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which will show the 
world your support for women. 
Altemativelyfbl(B)"(b)(7)(C) 
lgave $3 million "Breakthrough Awards" to two math 
professors. You can give me a similar award.Fl<6l; (b)(7)(C) 
I of Oxford, former President of 
the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, "I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was 
nice, and could well be useful." ln 2018, I solved a problem of P6lya Prize-winner b)(6); (b)(7)(C) 
which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a "challenging question" in 1976) abou mac mgs m 
infinite geometric lattices. 
I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in 
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now. 
If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject 
your gift, but Lincoh1 College, pa1i of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a 
lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000! 
https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowship 
I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting 
money from you would be "a tough one for a UK institution," but if you funded me as an 
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be 
open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you'd 
have an advocate at one of the world's most prestigious universities publically defending you. I 
could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don. 
Cordially,

Good afternoon all, 
Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they 
are requesting: 
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits; 
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and 
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference. 
Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a 
meeting last Friday witfbXB>· (b)(7)(C) 
I and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told 
our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when 
meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer ~~~L, I told my client and I that he would not be 
allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from 
Liutenant b~~~c or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. 
Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone 
calls. So far, no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with

Re: VM Epstein # 7 6318-054

~~~?: I asked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. I 
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-
file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, I told defense 
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me 
they would get back to me. I haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release 
the funds?

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last 
Friday wit~b)(ti)· (b)(7)(C) 
~nd Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be 
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, 
Officer ~1~?:c, ~old my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could 
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenan~~~~?; lor Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to 
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available? 
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, 
no phone calls. 
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal 
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would 
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines 
and no proper meal. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Good morning r x5); (b)(7)(C) I 
I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych 
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of 
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's 
subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death 
in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, I will have the USAO's Civil Division 
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 
(1951) and t he associated regulations. 
Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap 
machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. 
Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in 
responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream 
media. 
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the 
information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you 
have any statement on the situation?

Star Tribune: "Epstein's guards worked extreme OT shifts morning of death" Guards on 
Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working extreme overtime shifts to make up for staffing shortages the 
morning of his apparent suicide, a person familiar with the jail's operations told The Associated 
Press. http://www. startribune .com/ epstein-dies-in-the-dark-but-abuse-investigation-carries-

August 11, 2019, 11:13 PM Corrections officers had not checked in on financier and registered 
sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for "several" hours before he was found hanging in his cell Saturday, a 
person familiar with the matter said, just one in a series of missteps in the hours leading up to his 
death. [Continue Reading]

Jeffrey Epstein. [Continue Reading] 
NYT: "Before Jail Suicide, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left Alone and Not Closely Monitored," Katie 
Benner, August 11, 2019, 11:00 AM 
Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who hanged himself in a federal jail in Manhattan, was supposed to 
have been checked by guards every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not being followed the 
night before he was found, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said. In 
addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell 
just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's 
normal procedure, two officials said. [Continue Reading)

TEXT.htm, Certification of Identify Form.pdf 
Good morning ~b)(e); 
blm(CI 
I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych 
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of 
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's 
subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death 
in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, I will have the USAO's Civil Division 
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 
(1951) and the associated regulations. 
Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. 
Thank you,

With apologies for the weekend emai~ we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested 
last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an 
indictment tomorrow. His attorney, ~b)(6);(b)(7)(C) 
~as represented him in the past, and 
represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the 
weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but 
was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state. 
We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the 
presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you-is it at all 
possible to address this issue s )(6); (b)(7)(C) 
can meet with his client this evening? I'm 
available anytime at b)(e),(b)(7)(C) 
to discuss, if that's helpful, odb)(e);(b)(T)(C> 
~an also be 
reached directly at b)(e), (b)(l)(C) 
f that's easier ( though if you reach out directly to him if you 
could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful). 
thanks very much,

It is easier for us to initiate the call here at Mcc.f ><5>; (b)(7)(C) lwill be on a phone that does not allow incoming 
calls, so we prefer to call the court (or you) at the designated time and transfer the call down to him. Please

number to call at 11 :00 AM on August 9. 
Also, so you're aware, we make every effort to facilitate telephonic court appearances, but there may be 
emergency circumstances that interfere. If we learn that we will not be able to facilitate the call for some 
reason, we will let you know as soon as possible. 
If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

[ am writing to notify the Cou1t of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary rep011s identifying the exact cause of death. An 
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively 
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has 
requested that the Depa,tment of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter 
as well. 

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Epstein status hearing 
Attachments: 
TEXT.htm 
At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the 
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge 
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the 
government and defense counsel a chance to speak. 
[b)(5) 
Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked 
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent 
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is 
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't 
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SONY J. Sullivan) 
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense 
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a 
particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also 
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel 
obviously didn't know that Adam & I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go 
to SHU.) 
Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most 
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they 
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so. 
Page 1235 

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. 
They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC 
with the judge presiding over their case. 
Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the 
statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at 
the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court 
oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's 
co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice. 
At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and 
ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the 
investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion. 
Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any 
questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to 
forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me. 
Thanks,

[ am writing to notify the Cou1t of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary rep011s identifying the exact cause of death. An 
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively 
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has 
requested that the Depa,tment of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter 
as well. 

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

I apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've 
had quite a few visitors here at MCC recently. The Warden just learned about a meeting on Tuesday 
morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge 
Berman another ti me. Perhaps the Warden and I could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a 
time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.

knowledge, it has never been defi.nitivdy explajned what the BOP concluded abou.t that incident

The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting 
information on Epstein via their personal email. I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email 
to all staff on the media and who are the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition 
the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is 
prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts. 
New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

I hope this finds you well. My name isfb)(a); (b)(7)(C) 
~nd I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm 
sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to 
Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there 
have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat 
on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). 
I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, 
and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please 
let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556 b!~!;,.,

Did Mr. Epstein apparently hang himself? 
Who found him? An officer? Another inmate? 
Was he in his cell alone?

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested 
last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an 
indictment tomorrow. His attorney, ,b)(6)· (b)(7)(C) 
~as represented him in the past, and 
represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the 
weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but 
was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state. 
We 're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the 
presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you- is it at all 
possible to address this issue s 
><6>; (b)(7)(C) 
can meet with his client this evening? I'm 
available anytime at bX6>; (b)(7)(C)

Gentlemen. Do you have time for a quick update call before I leave for my trip with 
the AG? 
Does 12 noon work? If there is something new and pressing, we can do a call 
earlier.

Couldn't see the entire article on my phone, but I wouldn't be surprised there are staff that are 
paid contacts for local media outlets. This has also been discussed at the Department level all the 
way to the White House and who knows who may have overheard those discussions.

[ am writing to notify the Cou1t of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary rep011s identifying the exact cause of death. An 
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively 
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has 
requested that the Depa,tment of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter 
as well. 

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, 
Warden

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of t he paramedics involved in 
responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream 
media. 
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the 
information in t hem is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you 
have any statement on the situation?

Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been

This is a heads up that our public affairs office, IPPA leadership, and the Director's office drafted a statement 
for all Epstein inquiries today that DOJ's public affairs folks are now reviewing. USMS will also see it because 
they are getting media inquiries and called me. And DOJ's Legislative Affairs team as well as BOP's legislative 
affairs folks are getting Congressional interest (Members' offices saying we should take better care of him, 
etc.). 
The final response to media that will be approved by DOJ should be given to me within the hour and I will 
send it out to more than 30 reporters who've emailed me. I'll give the response t~
o can give it to 
media who've contacted him in Lee's absence (Lee also has been in touch with meto be sure I have all I 
need). 
I'll send you all the final approved response from DOJ when I get it.

The CNN article is quite critical and says DOJ officials are expressing frustration that the info BOP provided is 
turning up wrong. The only example they give is that officials believed over weekend he as released on bail, 
but it turns out that he was just moved to another facility. That is NOT TRUE. He was released and is not in 
BOP custody. Can you call OPA and ensure they know the truth as they are the DOJ officials that CNN is 
referring to. We never said he was released on bail...we only said he was released and that remains accurate.

Hello,

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of t he paramedics involved in 
responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream 
media. 
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the 
information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you 
have any statement on the situation?

The CNN article is quite critical and says DOJ officials are expressing frustration that the info BOP provided is 
turning up wrong. The only example they give is that officials believed over weekend he as released on bail, 
but it turns out t hat he was just moved to another facility. That is NOT TRUE. He was released and is not in 
BOP custody. Can you call OPA and ensure they know the truth as they are the DOJ officials that CNN is 
referring to. We never said he was released on bail...we only said he was released and that remains accurate.

Does 12 noon work? Ifthere is something new and pressing, we can do a call earlier.

Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges againstJ~~~r.\ 
fbX6); (b)(7)(C) 
I've spoken to an AFGE union official an 
><6>; (b){7)(C) 
efense attorney. The 
story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by CO 
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of 
documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the 
facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring 
surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide. 
Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death? 
Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide? 
Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide? 
Is it correct that Noel and Thomas were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the 
suicide? 
What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays 
in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.) 
Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges? 
What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers? 
Thank you,

The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting 
information on Epstein via their personal email. I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email 
to all staff on the media and who are the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition 
the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is 
prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts. 
New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to 
Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there 
have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat 
on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). 
I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, 
and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please 
let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556~ ~~?~c, I

I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych 
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of 
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's 
subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death 
in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, I will have the USAO's Civil Division 
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide 
Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA. 
2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding 
more information. 
(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOP's 
response to the union's contention is staffing shortages is at the root of the problem?

services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local 
hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital 
staff. The FBI is investigating the incident. 
Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under 
pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.
