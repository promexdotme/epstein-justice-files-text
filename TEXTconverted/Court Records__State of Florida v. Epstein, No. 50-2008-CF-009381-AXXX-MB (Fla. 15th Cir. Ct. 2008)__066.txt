AGREED ORDER 
This cause came on to be heard upon the agreement of the parties, Jack 
Goldberger representing Jeffrey Epstein and Barbara Burns representing the State of 
Florida, and the Court being fully advised that the parties have reviewed both the plea 
agreement and the transcript of the plea conference in the Defendants case and have 
confirmed that the requirement of "mandatory public service" as a special condition of 
community control checked off on the Order Placing the Defendant on Community Control 
was due to a clerical error. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the special 
condition of "mandatory public service" is deleted. 
The Court being further advised that the Order Placing the Defendant on Community 
Control did not address the Defendant's travel outside the State of Florida for work or 
business purposes and the parties desire to clarify that omission, it is hereby ordered and 
adjudged that the Defendant is authorized to travel outside the State of Florida for business 
and work purposes if allowed by his community control officer. At least 48 hours before 
the need to travel outside the State of Florida for work purposes the Defendant shall first 
obtain the permission of his community control officer and then follow any instructions or
