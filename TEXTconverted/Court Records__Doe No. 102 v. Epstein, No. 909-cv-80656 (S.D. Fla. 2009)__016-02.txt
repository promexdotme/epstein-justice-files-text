Re: 
Preservation of Evidence Relevant to Actions for Civil Remedies 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 
Gentlemen: 
As you know, we represent a number of the young women on the list of names provided 
to Messrs. Goldberger and Tein by the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding the Jeffrey Epstein Non-
Prosecution Agreement and Addendum. In order to be crystal clear as to whom we represent, we 
have attached a list of our present clients. By this letter, we want to ensure that discoverable 
information relating to each of their civil actions is being properly preserved, as is required under 
Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. You are required to take the necessary steps to 
preserve all paper documents, tangible objects (including, but not limited to, film, videos, DVDs, 
photographs, whether in hard copy, negatives or digital images), and electronically stored 
infotmation related to any threatened action by my clients, whether found inside or outside of the 
United States, including any information held by third parties. Although we may bring a motion 
for an order preserving documents and other data from destruction or alteration, your client's 
obligation to preserve documents and other data discovery in this case arises independently from 
any order on such motion. 
As you know, the Non-Prosecution Agreement also requires your client "to maintain [his] 
evidence, specifically evidence requested by 01· directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that 
have been issued, and inclnding certain computer equipment, inviolate until all of the teims of

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 2 of 4
this agreement have been satisfied." We will seek information related to Mr. Epstein's sexual 
exploitation of our clients in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422, 2423, 2251, 2252, and/or 
2252A, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Your client reasonably should have known of 
potential criminal pmsecution and/or civil litigation since, at least, October 25, 2005. This duty 
to preserve evidence extends to evidence beyond that which was seized from Mr. Epstein's 
residence on October 25, 2005. It also extends to evidence that was seized on October 25, 2005 
and later returned to him if it may be relevant and discoverable in any of these civil actions. 
Because of the-nature of these violations, we consider electronically stored information to 
be a critical and itTeplaceable source of discovery and/or evidence in this matter. You should 
anticipate that much of the information subject to disclosure or responsive to discove1y in this 
cause is stored on your current and former computer systems and other media and devices 
(including handheld devices, personal digital assistants, voice-messaging systems, online 
repositories and cell phones). Electronically stored infmmation should be afforded the broadest 
possible meaning and includes (by way of example and not as an exclusive list) potentially 
relevant information electronically, magnetically, optically or otherwise stored as: 
I. 
Digital communication (e.g., e-mail, voice mail, instant messaging); 
2. 
E-mail Server Stores (e.g., Lotus Domino .NSF or Microsoft Exchange .EDB) 
3. 
Word-processed documents (e.g., Word or WordPerfect files and drafts); 
4. 
Spreadsheets and tables (e.g., Excel or Lotus 123 worksheets); 
5. 
Accounting Application Data (e.g., QuickBooks, Money, Peachtree data); 
6. 
Image and Facsimile Files (e.g., .PDF, .TIFF, .JPG, .GIF images); 
7. 
Sound Recordings (e.g., .WAY and .MP3 files); 
8. 
Video and Animation (e.g., .A VI aud .MOV files); 
9. 
Databases (e.g., Access, Oracle, SQL Server data, SAP); 
10. 
Contact and Relationship Management Data (e.g., Outlook, ACTI); 
11. 
Calendar and Diaiy Application Data (e.g., Outlook PST, blog entries); 
12. 
Online Access Data (e.g., Tempora1y Internet Files, History, Cookies); 
13. 
Presentations (e.g., PowerPoint, Corel Presentations); 
14. 
Network Access and Server Activity Logs; 
15. 
Project Management Application Data; 
16. 
Computer Aided Design/Drawing Files; and 
17. 
Backup ai1d archival files (e.g., Veritas, Zip, .GHO). 
Electronically stored information resides not only in areas of electronic, magnetic, and 
optical storage media reasonably accessible to you and your client, but also in areas you may 
deem not reasonably accessible. You are obliged to preserve potentially relevant evidence from 
both sources of electronically stored information, even if you do not anticipate producing such 
electronically stored information. Similarly, you and your client are obligated to preserve all 
potentially relevant evidence even if you do not intend to produce such evidence because you 
anticipate raising your client's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
The laws and rules prohibiting destrnction of evidence apply to electronically stored 
information in the same manner that they apply to other evidence. Because of its format, 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 3 of 4
electronically stored information is easily deleted, modified or corrupted. Accordingly, your . 
client must take every reasonable step to preserve this information until the final resolution of 
this matter. Adequate preservation of electronically stored information requires more than 
simply refraining from efforts to destroy or dispose of such evidence. You must intervene to 
prevent loss due to routine operations or malfeasance and you must employ proper techniques 
and protocols to preserve electronically stored information. Booting a drive, examining its 
contents, or running any application may irretrievably alter the evidence it contains and constitute 
unlawful spoliation of evidence. Preservation requires preemptive immediate intervention. 
With regard to electronically stored infonnation created subsequent to the date of delive1y 
of this letter, relevant evidence should not be destroyed, and your client is to take appropriate 
steps required to avoid destruction of such evidence. 
Please fo1ward a copy of this letter to all persons and entities with custodial responsibility 
for the evidence referred to in this letter. 
Failure to abide by this request could result in penalties and/or sanctions against your 
client and could fo1m the basis oflegal claims for spoliation. 
If this c011'espondence is in any way unclear, please contact us immediately. We look 
fo1ward to receiving written confinnation from you that you have taken the necessmy steps to 
fulfill these preservation obligations by Thursday, May 21, 2009 in order to alleviate the need for 
us to seek a court order. 
Sincerely,
