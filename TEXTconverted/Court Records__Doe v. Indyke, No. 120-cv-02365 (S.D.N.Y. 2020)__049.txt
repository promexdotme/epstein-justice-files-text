Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors 
of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, in the referenced action. We write jointly with Plaintiff

to preserve the parties’ resources and in the interest of judicial economy, the parties 
respectfully request that the Court enter a sixty-day stay of this action, through November 
9, 2021. Should the parties resolve Plaintiff’s claims through settlement, they will 
thereafter promptly discontinue this action with prejudice. 
Respectfully submitted, 
/s/ Bennet J. Moskowitz
