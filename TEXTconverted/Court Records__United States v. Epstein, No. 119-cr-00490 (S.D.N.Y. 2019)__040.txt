         (Case called) 
THE COURT:  I had hoped to have a written decision and
order by now, which I don't, one that is regarding the
release/remand of Mr. Epstein, which has been the subject of
multiple written submissions and, as you all know, an in-court
hearing on Monday, July 15, 2019.  It is not quite physically
produced yet and it needs to be cite checked, but I should have
it on the docket in the next hour, two hours at most.  What I
will do, however, is state the conclusions in the decision and
order, which I had said I would do, and summarize very briefly
the contents of the ruling for you.
Starting with my conclusions, the government's
application for continued remand is hereby granted and the
defense application for pretrial release is respectfully hereby
denied.  Written opinion to follow.
In that opinion I will deal with all, I'll try to, all
the principal issues which have been briefed.  Even though it
is not entirely necessary or legally required to consider both
dangerousness to others and to the community as well as risk of
flight, I have done so.  I also deal with the defense's
proposed bail package.  There is obviously significant public
interest in all of these legal issues, so I tried to cover them
all as best I could.
There are the following headings in the decision and
order.  First is a background section, followed by counsel's

submissions.  Those are the written submissions: principally
the indictment, the legal principles governing release versus
remand, the presumption of remand in 18 U.S.C. section 1591
cases, danger to others and the community.  This topic has
seven subsections and fills over ten pages of the decision and
order.  I think it is fair to say that it is the heart of this
decision, that is to say, dealing with danger to others and to
the community.
Then I deal with risk of flight.  That has four
subsections or factors, which are substantially the same
factors that are used to analyze dangerousness.
Then, finally, the bail package proposed by the
defense.  Specifically, I find in the decision and order that
the government has established dangerousness to others and to
the community by clear and convincing evidence and also that
the government has established risk of flight by a
preponderance of the evidence.  I also reject the proposed bail
package as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail
concerning what I consider to be its deficiencies.
Incidentally, I am not suggesting that a different
bail package would be appropriate because I doubt that any bail
package can overcome danger to the community.
I focus then on dangerousness to others, most
certainly including the minor victims in this case and
prospective victims as well.  I cite and quote, for example,

the compelling testimony of Annie Farmer and Courtney Wild, who
testified that they fear for their safety and the safety of
others if Mr. Epstein were to be released.
I also point out that the presumption of remand, as
opposed to the presumption of release, is unusual in our
jurisprudence and that it attaches only to very serious crimes,
such as sex trafficking involving minor victims, as in this
case some allegedly as young as age 14.
I also discuss evidence of intimidation and threats
and compensation paid to potential witnesses and the facts
surrounding whether or not Mr. Epstein has been compliant with
his legal obligations as a registered sex offender.
When discussing risk of flight, which you obviously
can tell comes after, in my analysis, dangerousness to the
community, when discussing that aspect, risk of flight, the
decision speaks to the seriousness of the charged crimes, to
Mr. Epstein's great wealth and his vast resources, which
include private planes and frequent international travel and
also a foreign residence in Paris.
I mention the items very recently seized from Mr. 
Epstein's New York City mansion pursuant to lawful search 
warrants, which include sexually explicit photos and discs, 
some $70,000 in cash, diamonds, and an expired Austrian 
passport with Mr. Epstein's photo but with a name that is 
different from Jeffrey Epstein, and also contains a reference

to Saudi Arabia as a residence. 
I think I have given you a fair account of the
decision and order.  As I said before, the written version in
its complete form, which will be about 30 to 34 pages long I
imagine, I hope will be available reasonably soon.
One piece of business in light of today's ruling.  I
thought I would schedule a conference with the parties for
Wednesday, July 31, at 11:00 a.m.  That is not fixed in stone.
If you all want to meet and confer and let me know if that is a
convenient date, or I'm happy to accommodate you with another
date as well.
For the moment, I'll tentatively schedule a conference
for July 31st at 11:00 a.m. and ask if there is an application
for exclusion of speedy trial.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  The government moves to
exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act from today's date until
July 31st.
THE COURT:  I am going to find under 18 United States
Code section 3161 that adjournment to and including July 31 at
11:00 a.m. is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the
adjourned time from speedy trial calculations.  I further find
that the exclusion is designed to prevent any possible
miscarriage of justice, to facilitate these proceedings, and to
guarantee effective representation of and preparation by all
counsel for both parties, both sides.  Thus, the need for

exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of the
public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18
U.S.C. section 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B).
Finally, a word about the proposed conference.  From
my point of view, it would be more or less a scheduling/case
management type conference, but I'm happy to consider any
issues that you might have at that time.
I think that's it.  Everybody, thank you for being
here.  We are adjourned.
