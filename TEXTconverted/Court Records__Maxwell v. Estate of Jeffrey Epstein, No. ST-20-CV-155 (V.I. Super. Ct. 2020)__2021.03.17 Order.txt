Case No. ST-2020-CV-00155 
Action for Indemnification 
ORDER 
THIS MATTER was referred, sua sponte, by Order dated and entered February l l, 2021, to 
determine whether the case should be treated as complex. The Court issues this Order to set a briefing 
schedule for the parties to follow in addressing that question. Additionally, upon reviewing the case, the 
Court notes that the Government of the Virgin Islands ("Government") moved to intervene. Assuming, 
for purposes of this determination only, that the motion would be granted, the Court will allow the 
Government to be heard as to whether complex treatment is appropriate. The Court takes judicial notice 
that a similar order was entered on March 12, 2021, in Case No. ST-2020-CV-OO0 14, Government of the 
Virgin Islands v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., setting a briefing schedule for the parties to follow as to whether 
that case should be designated as complex. Considering that the Co-Executors are parties in both cases, 
and in the related probate matter, and further that the Co-Executors filed the motion in Case No. ST-2020-
CV-000 14 to designate it as complex, the Court will direct them to respond first, whether in support or in 
opposition to complex treatment, followed by Plaintiff Ghislane Maxwell and the Government. Further

response by the Co-Executors will only be permitted on motion showing cause but should be accompanied 
by the proposed surresponse, if any. 
Accordingly, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the Co-Executors MAY SERVE and FILE a response in writing within ten (10) 
days from the date of entry of this Order addressing whether this case should be designated as complex 
and/or assigned to the same judge as Case No. ST-2020-CV-000 14 to avoid delay and inconsistent rulings. 
Plaintiff Ghislane Maxwell and the Government of the Virgin Islands MAY SERVE and FILE a reply to 
the Co-Executors' response within fifteen (15) days from the date the Co-Executors file their response, 
if any, or if none, then within fifteen (15) days from when the response was due. It is further 
ORDERED that failure to file a response or reply will be construed as no objection to designating 
this case as complex or assigning it to the same judge as the other related cases. No extensions of time 
will be granted given the length of time that has already passed since the February 11, 2021 Order was 
entered without response from the current or prospective parties. Lastly, the Court will make its decision 
based on the papers without oral argument. 
A copy of this Order shall be served on Kyle R. Waldner, Esq., Christopher Allen Kroblin, Esq., 
and Assistant Attorney General Ariel M. Smith, Esq.
