DEFENDANT'S, MOTION FOR EXTENSION DIRECTED TO THE COURT 
PURSUANT TO RULE 4, REVIEW AND APPEAL-SOUTHERN DISTRICT, IN 
CONNECTION WITH THIS COURT'S ORDER DATED FEBRUARY 4, 2010 (DE 462) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter "Epstein"), by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, and Pursuant to Rule 4, Review and Appeal - Southern District, 
and other applicable rules as well as this court's discretion, respectfully moves this Court 
for an extension of time in which to " ... file with the Clerk of the Court, and serve of all 
parties written objections which shall specifically set forth the order, or part thereof, 
appealed from [and] a concise statement of the alleged error in the [] ruling, and 
statutory, rule, or case authority, in support of defendant's position." As good cause in 
support of granting the motion, Defendant states: 
I. 
This court entered an order (DE 462) stating that Epstein must provide 
documents responsive to request to numbers 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13 within 14 days from the 

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM   Document 464    Entered on FLSD Docket 02/09/2010   Page 2 of 4
Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 17-6   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 2 of 4
date of said order. Federal Rule 4 allows for an appeal to be filed within 14 days of said 
order 
2. 
Based upon the timing of the order to produce documents and the 14 day 
time period allowed for the filing of an Appeal, there remains a conflict as to the timing 
of both. Defendant needs an extension of time as a result of said timing conflict, and for 
additional the reasons set forth below. 
3. 
Defendant seeks to appeal, pursuant to Rule 4, those portions of the order 
which specifically address the above requests for production. Given the breadth of the 5th 
Amendment addressing the above requests and the fact that the order does not address 
various issues in the Response (including relevance), the Defendant respectfully requests 
an additional 15 days from February 18, 2010 within which to "file with the Clerk of the 
Court, and serve of all parties written objections which shall specifically set forth the 
order, or part thereof, appealed from [and] a concise statement of the alleged error in the 
[] ruling, and statutory, rule, or case authority, in support of defendant's position." As 
such, Defendant requests that the due date effectively be moved to August 31, 2009. 
4. 
The undersigned, Michael J. Pike, has a special set hearing in front of the 
Honorable Elizabeth Metzgen in Stuart, Florida on February 9, 2010. In addition, the 
undersigned, Robert D. Critton, Jr., Esq., is scheduled for various depositions in these 
related matters. 
5. 
This request is not made to delay and will not prejudice any of the parties. 
6. 
While this request is within the sound discretion of the court pursuant to 
Rule 4, the undersigned has consulted with opposing counsel and he has not agreed.

Wherefore, the undersigned respectfully requests the relief sought herein, and for 
such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.
