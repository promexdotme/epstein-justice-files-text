Re: 
Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
 
Your Honor: 
 
 
 
We represent Plaintiff Teala Davies, and write on behalf of all parties.    
 
 
 
On January 21, 2020, Defendants submitted a pre-motion letter to 
Judge Woods proposing to file a motion to dismiss.  (ECF 16).  On January 22, 
Judge Woods issued an Amended Order Referring Case to Magistrate Judge 
clarifying that dispositive motions in this matter will be referred to Your Honor for 
Report & Recommendation.  (ECF 17).  It is our understanding of Your Honor’s 
Individual Practices that no pre-motion letters are required for motions other than 
discovery motions, though Plaintiff’s counsel is of course happy/prepared to submit 
one should Your Honor prefer that. 
 
 
 
Accordingly, we write 1) to seek clarification that Plaintiff need not 
submit a letter in response to Defendants’ January 21 pre-motion letter addressed 
to Judge Woods, and 2) to propose the following briefing schedule for Defendants’ 
motion: 
 
- 
Defendants’ motion papers to be filed by February 25, 2020; 
- 
Plaintiffs’ opposition papers to be filed by March 17, 2020; 
- 
Defendants’ reply papers to be filed by March 31, 2020. 
 
 
 
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to this matter. 
 
  
 
Very truly yours, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 /s/ Mariann Meier Wang
