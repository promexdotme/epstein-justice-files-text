Plaintiff alleges a claim under the laws of the United States.  This Court has supplemental

substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District.  
Factual Allegations 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”) was an adult male in his 
early 50’s.  Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires.  He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence.  He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL.  The allegations herein concern Epstein’s conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach.  
9. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls.  He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money.  In or about  2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell into Epstein’s trap 
and became one of his victims.  
10. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas.  
11. 
Epstein’s scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit underage girls.  These 
underage girls were recruited ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 2 of 8

 
 
- 3 - 
in his Palm Beach mansion. Epstein, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically 
disadvantaged underage girls from Palm Beach County who would be enticed by the money being 
offered - generally $200 to $300 per “massage” session - and who were perceived as less likely to 
complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made.    
12. 
Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method.  The underage 
victim would be brought or directed to Epstein’s mansion, where she would be led up a flight of 
stairs to a room that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings.   The girl would then 
find herself alone in the room with Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel.  He would then 
remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes.  
Epstein would then perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts.  
13. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe was recruited by another 
girl, who told her that she could make some money, but did not tell her what was involved.  At all 
relevant times, the girl who recruited Jane Doe was acting on behalf of and as agent for Epstein.  
Jane was contacted by this girl by telephone.  Jane was then picked up and brought to Epstein’s 
mansion in Palm Beach.   Once there, she was led up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage 
table.  Epstein came into the room and directed Jane to remove her clothes and give him a massage.  
Jane was frightened and felt trapped.  As directed by Epstein, Jane removed her clothes.  Epstein 
then during the massage touched Jane on her breasts and vagina, and he grabbed her hand and placed 
it on his penis.  Epstein masturbated himself during the massage.   Epstein then left money for Jane.   
14. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experienced confusion, shame, 
humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries.

27. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 above.  
 
28. 
Epstein used a facility or means of interstate commerce to knowingly persuade, 
induce or entice Jane Doe, when she was under the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or 
sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. 
29. 
On June 30, 2008, Epstein entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida §§ 796.07 
and 796.03, in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case nos. 2008-cf-
009381AXXXMB and 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB), for conduct involving the same plan and 
scheme as alleged herein. 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 5 of 8

 
 
- 6 - 
30. 
As to Plaintiff Jane Doe, Epstein could have been charged with criminal violations of 
Florida Statute §796.07(2) (including subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) thereof), and other 
criminal offenses including violations of Florida Statutes §§798.02 and 800.04 (including 
subsections (5), (6) and (7) thereof). 
31. 
Epstein’s acts and conduct are in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422.  
32. 
As a result of Epstein’s violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422, Plaintiff has suffered 
psychological and physical injuries.  
33. 
Although Epstein’s acts of inducement and enticement to sexual activity occurred in 
or about 2001, when Jane Doe was minor, she was not immediately aware of her injuries.  
Specifically, she did not become aware that she had suffered psychological and emotional effects 
from the acts and conduct of Epstein until no earlier than calendar year 2008.  
34. 
Jane Doe did not (and due to various coping mechanisms, was unable to) make a 
causal connection between her injuries and the sexual acts and other misconduct of Epstein until 
2008.  Jane Doe did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that she had 
been injured and that Epstein had caused her injuries until calendar year 2008.  
35. 
Plaintiff retained Mermelstein & Horowitz, P.A. (f/k/a Herman & Mermelstein, P.A.), 
 as her attorneys in this matter and agreed to pay them a reasonable attorneys’ fee.  
 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 8 demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein for all damages available under 18 U.S.C. §2255(a), including without limitation, actual and 
compensatory damages, costs of suit, and attorneys’ fees, and such other and further relief as this 
Court deems just and proper.
