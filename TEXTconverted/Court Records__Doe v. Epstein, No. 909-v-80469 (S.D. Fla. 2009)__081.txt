PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL’S RESPONSE TO COURT’S ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
Plaintiff’s counsel responds to the Court’s Order to Show Cause, and states:
1.
Plaintiff’s counsel apologizes to the Court for a failure to finalize a Joint
Scheduling Conference Report and Order and to file same with the Court in accordance
with the Court’s Order.
2.
The parties did exchange a number of drafts of the Joint Scheduling Report
and proposed Order but despite efforts to finalize it did not do so. There was some delay
in effecting service on Defendant SARAH KELLEN, who is believed to have been avoiding
service, and this accounts for part of the delay in filing the Report and Proposed Order,
although it certainly does not excuse it.    
3.
The parties have been involved in settlement discussions for some time, and
reached a resolution of the claims in this and the State court companion case this week,
and all claims have been resolved. Defendant has filed a Joint Stipulation and proposed
Order indicating the resolution of this case.
