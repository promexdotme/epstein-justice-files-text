REPLY TO ROTHSTEIN ROSENFELDT ADLER'S P.A.'S 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ORDER 
FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE (DE 4051 
(AS TO JANE DOE v. EPSTEIN CASE NO.: 08-CIV- 80893) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby files his Reply to Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler P.A.' s ("RRA") Response to 
Defendant's Emergency Motion for Order for the Preservation of Evidence [DE 405], 
and states: 
1. 
It now appears that the Honorable Herbert Stettin ("Mr. Stettin") is the 
sole individual, as the Chief Restructuring Officer, in charge of RRA assets, including 
electronic and paper records. There also appears to be no objection to the entry of the 
preservation order consistent with his fiduciary/trustee duties for RRA, although certain 
documents may no longer exist within his possession. 
2. 
Par. 4 of the response reflects that some 40 plus boxes of documents were 
obtained by the Department of Justice from search warrants served on the offices of 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 2 of 5
RRA; "it is believed that the Department of Justice also sequestered about (13) boxes of 
documents related to this [Epstein] case." In fact there are three Epstein cases which 
have been brought by the RRA firm, one being in federal court, two in state court. Mr. 
Stettin confirms Defendant's belief that there are serious ethical and potentially criminal 
issues that may impact Plaintiffs' ability to pursue their cases. 
3. 
Unfortunately, time is critical with regard to this case in that there are 
deadlines to Disclose Experts and Exchange Reports by October 29, 2009 (but Plaintiff 
has not seen her expert, has no report and only made herself available for the Defendant's 
exam on November 13, 2009), deposition discovery deadline is November 28, 2009 and 
a calendar call of February 19, 2010 for the February 22, 2010 trial docket. While the 
undersigned understands that Mr. Stettin may be working expeditiously to deal with 
critical and pressing needs of stabilizing the firm, a delay of 45 days for his deposition 
(which has been set in the state court case in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach 
County, State of Florida, L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB, 
not the case sub-judice) will place his deposition sometime during the first 15 days of 
January, after every pre-trial deadline has expired. 
4. 
If in fact there has been inappropriate and/or illegal conduct associated 
with the prosecution of this case by RRA or any of its attorneys or by the Plaintff herself, 
which might result in sanctions, dismissal or other remedy, Defendant Epstein will be 
severely prejudiced. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Epstein request that the court's preservation order be 
made permanent, which does not seem inconsistent with Mr. Stettin's position as 
expressed by his lawyers but deny the relief sought for delaying the deposition unless the 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 3 of 5
court is disposed to modify the current scheduling deadlines and trial date that exist in 
this case.
