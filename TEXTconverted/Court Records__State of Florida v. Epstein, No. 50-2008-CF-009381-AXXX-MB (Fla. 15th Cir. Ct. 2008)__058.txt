INTERVENER'S RESPONSE TO MOTION TO STAY 
AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
COMES NOW, Intervener,~ and files this Response to Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's 
Motion to Stay, and states: 
In their motion, Defendant asks the Court to stay its ruling on the production of the NP A 
agreement pending review by the Fourth DCA. Since this NPA was never properly sealed in the 
first place, a Stay is improper because this document is a public record until such time as it has 
been properly sealed. Furthermore, as Defendant EPSTEIN has failed to demonstrate that he is 
likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal or describe how he will be banned by this 
disclosure, Intervenerllll respectfully requests the Court deny their Motion. 
Pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.3I0(a), a trial court has the discretion 
to enter a stay pending interlocutory review of a non-final order. The burden to satisfy the

requirements for a stay rests with the party requesting the stay. A trial ~ourt is not obligated, or 
even encouraged, to enter such a stay as the Appellate Rules specifically provide, "In the absence 
of a stay, during the pendency of a review of a non-final order, the lower tribunal may proceed 
with all matten, including trial or final hearing; provided that the lower tribunal may not render 
a final order disposing of the cause pending such review." Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(f) (emphasis 
added). 
Defendants ask the Court to stay disclosure of a public document which was never 
properly sealed. Factors to be considered by a court when deciding whether to enter a stay 
"include the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, and the likelihood of hann 
should a stay not be granted." Perez v. Perez, 769 So.2d 389, 391 n.4 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999). 
Defendants fail to adequately address these factors in their motion. 
In fact, Defendant 
completely ignores the likelihood of success analysis. 
Likely this is because there is no 
likelihood that the Fourth District would reverse this court's ruling since the proper procedures 
for sealing the NP A were never followed. 
As to likelihood of hann, the only reference Defendantllllllll makes to this issue is in 
paragraph 3 of his motion. Here, Defendant merely makes a broad assertion that there will be 
"irrep~ble harm caused by the disclosure of the NP A." There is no explanation of who will be 
banned or what harm will be caused. How can a public document which redacts the names of 
the minor victims cause harm? This necessary question is never answered. Defendant's broad 
and vague assertion is insufficient to grant a stay. 
Finally, since there has been no showing by Defendant EPSTEIN that the proper 
procedure for sealing court documents were ever followed, the NP A is a public record.
