A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Have you spoken with other people, including other 
law enforcement officers, about this investigation?

So ladies and gentlemen, some of the 
testimony that you're going to hear today will include 
hearsay. As you know, that means that the witness will not 
be testifying solely from her own observations, but that 
she'll also be reporting what others have told her and what 
she has read in reports and documents prepared by others. 
Hearsay evidence is admissible in these grand jury 
proceedings and you're free to rely on it in determining 
whether there is probable cause to indict any proposed 
defendants, if we end up returning to present a proposed 
indictment.

Q. 
And what does this record reflect? 
A. 
That a call was made at around 2:08 p.m. on

just explain for the Grand Jury what the different fields are

he's flown out, his aircraft has flown out, and shows from 
location and to the arrival destination. 
Q.

Do you recognize the airport codes to the right of

Just so we have the timeline straight. If we could 
back to slide 30. I believe you testified earlier that the 
phone call highlighted here is on September 16, 2004 at 2:00 
o'clock, is that correct? 
A.
