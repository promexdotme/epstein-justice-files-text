PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 4’S MOTION FOR  
SANCTIONS AND MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 4, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby files this Motion 
for Sanctions and Motion for Protective Order and Incorporated Memorandum of Law, and states 
as follows:   
 
1. 
By now, this Court is familiar with Jeffrey Epstein’s practice of intimidating and 
harassing his victims, as well as the Plaintiffs’ level of fear of Jeffrey Epstein.  See, e.g. Plaintiffs 
Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102’s Motion for No-Contact Order (D.E. 113);  Plaintiffs 
Jane Does 2-7’s Response to Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the 
Style of this Case  (D.E. 144); Plaintiffs Jane Does’ 2-7 Motion for Protective Order and 
Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 223); Plaintiffs Jane Doe Nos. 2-8’s Motion for 
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM   Document 306    Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2009   Page 1 of 6
Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 1 of 17

Protective Order as to Jeffrey Epstein’s Attendance at Deposition of Plaintiffs, and Incorporated 
Memorandum of Law (D.E. 292); Affidavit of Dr. Kliman (D.E. 223, Exh. A). 
2. 
On September 16, 2009, Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct reached a new low when he 
recklessly violated (i) this Court’s No-Contact Order dated July 31, 2009; and (2) a written 
stipulation between the parties that Jeffrey Epstein would not attend the deposition of Jane Doe 
No. 4 or be seen by Jane Doe No. 4 while attending her deposition. 
3. 
Prior to the deposition of Jane Doe No. 4, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for 
Protective Order to preclude Jeffrey Epstein from attending the depositions of the Plaintiffs.   
The Motion was filed for the specific purpose of preventing Jeffrey Epstein from intimidating or 
harassing the Plaintiffs as he has repeatedly done in the past.  As the Motion had not been 
adjudicated prior to the deposition of Jane Doe No. 4, Plaintiff’s counsel stipulated with defense 
counsel that “Jeffrey Epstein will not attend the deposition of Jane Doe No. 4.”  It was further 
stipulated that Jeffrey Epstein may listen to the deposition by telephone or view a videofeed of 
the deposition, but under no circumstances was he to be seen by our client while attending the 
deposition.  (See Exhibit “C”, email of September 15, 2009).  These were express conditions 
agreed to by counsel before Jane Doe No. 4 would appear for deposition on September 16, 2009.  
4. 
The deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 was scheduled for 1:00 p.m. on September 16, 
2009 at 350 Australian Ave South, Suite 115, West Palm Beach, Florida. 
5. 
At approximately 1:00 p.m. on September 16, 2009, Jane Doe No. 4 and her 
counsel were walking in the lobby of 350 Australian Ave South, Suite 115, West Palm Beach, 
Florida, toward the ground-floor conference room where her deposition was to be held.1
                                                          
1 Defendant’s counsel set the deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 for the same office building where 
Jeffrey Epstein has an office.

3
few feet away from this conference room, Jeffrey Epstein crossed paths with Jane Doe No. 4. 
Jeffrey Epstein stopped walking and began staring at her.  He intimidated her until she began to 
cry.  Jeffrey Epstein made no immediate attempt to walk away from our client.  Instead, he 
stopped and continued to stare at her until she ran away.  Jeffrey Epstein was accompanied by 
what appeared to be his bodyguard.  See Declaration of Adam Horowitz, counsel for Jane Doe 
No. 4, Exhibit “A”. 
6. 
Jane Doe No. 4 became an emotional wreck upon being stared at by Jeffrey 
Epstein, whom she believed she would not encounter.   After attempting to console his client, 
Plaintiff’s counsel cancelled the deposition after a brief discussion with defense counsel about 
the events that occurred in the lobby. See Transcript of Deposition of Jane Doe No. 4, Exhibit 
“B”. 
7. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s contact with and intimidation of Jane Doe No. 4 is in direct 
violation of this Court’s No-Contact Order dated July 31, 2009.  In that Order, this Court stated 
that Jeffrey Epstein shall have no “direct or indirect contact” with the Plaintiffs. (D.E. 238). 
8. 
The July 31, 2009 Order mirrored the June 30, 2008 criminal sentence entered by 
Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillio, wherein she instructed Jeffrey Epstein 
that he shall have “no direct or indirect contact” with the Plaintiffs. (D.E. 238) 
9. 
There can be no doubt that Jeffrey Epstein knew where Jane Doe No. 4 
would be at 1 p.m. on September 16, 2009.  Of all of the places he could have been, he chose 
to be at the location of her deposition in flagrant disregard of two (2) No-Contact Orders 
and the stipulation of the parties in this case.  Even worse, when he saw Jane Doe No. 4, he 
chose to stop and stare her down to the point of intimidation until she began to cry and flee.

10. 
This Court has discretion to enter a protective order to protect a party from 
annoyance, embarrassment or oppression.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  In this regard, the Court has 
discretion for cause shown to, inter alia, designate the persons who may attend depositions, and 
specify the time and place of discovery.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c)(1)(A) and (E).  Additionally, this 
Court has authority to sanction a party for civil contempt for violating the terms of a court order. 
See Sizzler Family Steak Houses v. Western Sizzlin Steak House, Inc., 793 F.2d 1529, 1534-35 
(11th Cir. 1986) (attorneys’ fees may be awarded for civil contempt in failure to comply with 
court order).   
11. 
Jeffrey Epstein is a felon and registered sex offender.  Judicial oversight, at 
Jeffrey Epstein’s expense, is required to keep his conduct under control.   
12. 
Given Jeffrey Epstein’s violation of this Court’s No-Contact Order and the 
written stipulation of the parties, appropriate sanctions and other relief are necessary to 
compensate Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 4 and prevent future misconduct by Defendant Epstein.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 4, respectfully requests (1) an award of sanctions, 
including attorneys’ fees and costs reasonably and necessarily incurred by Plaintiff due to 
Defendant’s non-compliance with the Court’s No-Contact Order; (2) an Order excusing Jane 
Doe No. 4 from her deposition on September 16, 2009, due to Defendant’s violation of the No-
Contact Order and defense counsel’s breach of his promise to Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendant 
would not be seen at Plaintiff’s deposition; (3) an order directing that any depositions of 
Plaintiffs in the future be at a court reporter’s office selected by Plaintiffs’ counsel; (4) 
appointment of a special master to preside at Plaintiffs’ depositions and control the proceeding, 
to be paid for by Defendant; and (5)  all other relief as this Court deems just and appropriate.

DECLARATION OF ADAM D. HOROWITZ 
1. 
My name is Adam D. Horowitz. I am an attorney for Jane Doe No. 4. 
2. 
The deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 was scheduled for September 16, 2009 at 1:00 
p.m. at 350 Australian Ave. South, Suite 115, West Palm Beach, Florida. On the day before the 
deposition, the undersigned and counsel for Jeffrey Epstein entered into a written stipulation in 
which it was agreed that "Jeffrey Epstein will not attend tomorrow's deposition of Jane Doe No. 
4 (in the absence of a court order permitting him to attend)." It was further agreed that Jeffrey 
Epstein may listen in to the deposition by telephone or view a videofeed of the deposition, but 
under no circumstances would he "be seen by our client." 
3. 
While Jane Doe No. 4 and I were in the lobby of 350 Australian Ave South at 
approximately 1:00 p.m. for her deposition on September 16, 2009, we crossed paths with 
Jeffrey Epstein and someone who appeared to be his bodyguard. 
Jeffrey Epstein stopped

walking and began to stare at and intimidate Jane Doe No. 4. Jane Doe No. 4 was terrified, 
began crying and ran outside the building. Jeffrey Epstein smirked at her and walked away.

As a result of this incident, Jane Doe began crying uncontrollably and was unable 
to proceed with her deposition. 
Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have read the foregoing Declaration and the 
facts stated in it are true.

We're canceling today's deposition. 
Before 
appearing here today, we had a stipulation with 
Defense counsel that Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, the 
Defendant, would not be here. 
He would not 
cross paths with our client. 
And immediately as we were approaching the 
deposition room, he made face-to-face contact 
with our client. 
He was just feet away from

her and intimidated her, and for that reason 
we're not going forward. 
MR. 
CRITTON: 
I didn't see any contact 
because I, obviously, was not out there. 
We 
started at about 
when you came in it was 
approximately 1:03. 
Mr. Epstein has an office 
here at the Florida Science Foundation. 
Had 
you been here at 1:00, your paths never would 
have crossed because Mr. Epstein was leaving 
the building. 
I instructed him to leave the 
building so that he would not be here. 
He was going to appear by way of Skype so 
that he could be on a video camera so that he 
could see this . 
(Mr. 
MR. 
Goldberger entered the room.) 
CRITTON: 
Had you been here on time, 
5 
and not faulting, I am just saying had you been 
here on time at 1:00, as everyone else seemed 
to be here at least get here before you did, 
Adam, you and your client, your paths never 
would have crossed . 
I directed Mr. Epstein to leave the 
building so he would not be here so that there 
would be no way that your paths could have 
crossed. 
It was neither my intent nor was it

my client's intent specifically , because I also 
advised him that he was not to cross paths, not 
to have any contact with your client, and 
certainly by our agreement not to be here today 
for the deposition. 
MR. 
HOROWITZ: 
And at approximately 1:00 
is exactly when my client crossed paths with 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
And not only did he cross 
paths but he proceeded to stare her down just 
feet away from her. 
For that reason she became 
an emotional wreck and cannot proceed with the 
deposition. 
She's simply not in an emotional 
state to do so. 
And in addition Mr. Epstein violated the 
agreement between counsel that he would not 
cross paths or come into contact with our 
client . 
And it will be also for the criminal 
court judge to decide whether he has violated a 
no-contact order. 
MR. 
CRITTON: 
I have nothing else to say. 
Again I instructed 
Mr. Epstein to leave the building so absolutely 
no contact could occur between he and 
Mr. Horowitz and his client nor anyone else. 
Until the court, until either Judge Marra or 
Judge Johnson ruled on the issue as to whether
