ARGUMENT 
I. 
PLAINTIFF IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN 
THIS CIRCUIT.  
 
This action involves Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault of Plaintiff (“Plaintiff”) 
in violation of the New York Law and/or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 through 1595.  Plaintiff submits this Memorandum of Law 
in support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Proceed Anonymously.  Allowing 
Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will protect her highly sensitive personal 
information that will remain the focus of this litigation. There is no prejudice to 
Defendants in allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously, nor is there any significant 
public interest in the disclosure of the Plaintiff’s identity.  In fact, the public interest 
in this case weighs in favor of granting Plaintiff’s request to proceed anonymously 
for her protection.  
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) requires a Complaint to “include the 
names of all the parties.”  However, the court has discretion to allow a plaintiff to 
proceed anonymously.  Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 190 (2d. 
Cir. 2008).  “[C]ourts have granted anonymity to protect against disclosure of a wide 
range of issues involving matters of the utmost intimacy, including sexual assault.” 
Doe. No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 196 (EDNY 2006); see also 1991 McKinney’s 
Sessions Laws of N.Y. at 2211-2212 (“sexual assault victims have unfortunately had

to endure a terrible invasion of their physical privacy. They have a right to expect 
that this violation will not be compounded by a further invasion of their privacy”).  
“When determining whether a plaintiff may be allowed to maintain an action 
under a pseudonym, the plaintiff’s interest in anonymity must be balanced against 
both the public interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant.”  Id. at 189.  
The balancing of interests entails the consideration of ten non-exhaustive factors, 
though the court has discretion to consider “other factors relevant to the particular 
case under consideration.” Id. at 189-190. The ten factors are: 
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and 
of a personal nature; (2) whether identification poses a risk of 
retaliatory physical or mental harm to the party seeking to proceed 
anonymously or even more critically, to innocent non-parties; (3) 
whether identification presents other harms and the likely severity of 
those harms, including whether the injury litigated against would be 
incurred as a result of the disclosure of the plaintiff’s identity; (4) 
whether the plaintiff is particularly vulnerable to the possible harms of 
disclosure, particularly in light of [her] age; (5) whether the suit is 
challenging the actions of the government or that of private parties; (6) 
whether the defendant is prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to press 
[her] claims anonymously, whether the nature of that prejudice (if any) 
differs at any particular stage of the litigation, and whether any 
prejudice can be mitigated by the district court; (7) whether the 
plaintiff’s identity has thus far been kept confidential; (8) whether the 
public’s interest in the litigation is furthered by requiring the plaintiff 
to disclose his identity; (9) whether, because of the purely legal nature 
of the issues presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public 
interest in knowing the litigants’ identities; and (10) whether there are 
any  alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the 
plaintiff.

II. 
ALL TEN ANONYMITY FACTORS WEIGH IN FAVOR OF 
PERMITTING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY.  
 
In this case, all delineated Sealed Plaintiff factors support Plaintiff’s 
application for anonymity, which should be granted for her protection.  Plaintiff is a 
victim of multiple instances sexual assault as a minor child.  The heinous acts that 
were committed against Plaintiff are highly sensitive in nature and are particularly 
difficult for her to address in a public forum. 
For those reasons, among many others, identification of Plaintiff in this matter 
may pose a risk of retaliation. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  In order to 
warrant anonymity, the possible retaliatory harm may be either physical or 
psychological in nature. See Doe v. Del Rio, 241 F.R.D. 154, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) 
Epstein’s vast wealth and far reaching connections make it clear that retaliation 
could be employed against individuals pursuing claims against the Estate of Jeffrey 
Epstein.  In addition to exposing Plaintiff to physical or psychological harm, 
retaliation could also silence potential witnesses from coming forward.  
The public exposure of Plaintiff’s identity would certainly cause her to suffer 
additional or exacerbated emotional or psychological harm including shame, 
embarrassment, depression, anxiety, and the array of side effects that go along 
therewith.  Should Plaintiff’s real identity be revealed, her safety could also be at 
risk as she is the world and the press who are currently laser focused on Jeffrey 
Epstein and his sexually exploitative escapades.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 4 of 7

Despite the fact that Defendants are private parties and not Government 
entities, Defendants are not “ordinary” private parties because of Epstein’s known 
wealth, power, and reputation. See Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195 (2006).  Jeffrey Epstein 
has been a known sexual predator with substantial financial influence for many 
years.  For years before his death, Epstein had been investigated by various state 
prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for his sexual assaults on 
young girls.  
Given Epstein’s notoriety, Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and the 
widespread concealment of the same “raise concerns affecting a larger association 
rather than the interest of an individual plaintiff.” See id. at 195. In this case, the 
“larger association” is society in general. Society has an interest in eradicating the 
predatory practices of powerful men against vulnerable, susceptible women—
including the practice of luring young girls for sexual purposes.  This case is 
therefore more “analogous to one involving a government defendant, where personal 
anonymity is more readily granted because of the existence of a public interest in the 
action.” EW v. New York Blood Center, 213 F.R.D. 108, 112 (EDNY 2003). 
“The public right to scrutinize governmental functioning is not so completely 
impaired by a grant of anonymity to a party as it is by closure of the trial itself . . . 
Party anonymity does not obstruct the public’s view of the issues joined or the 
court’s performance in resolving them.”  See Doe v. Stegall¸ 653 F.2d 180, 185 (5th 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 5 of 7

Cir. 1981).  The public’s interest in this legal question is not furthered by requiring 
Plaintiff to disclose her identity. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190 (citing Del 
Rio, 241 F.R.D. at 154 (“whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the 
litigants’ identities”)); see also Free Speech v. Reno, Case No. 98 Civ. 2680 MBM, 
1999 WL 47310 at *3 (SDNY Feb. 1, 1999) (“because the particular plaintiffs in this 
constitutional challenge are essentially interchangeable with similarly situated 
persons, there appears little public interest in which particular persons have actually 
sued…”).  Because Plaintiff’s anonymity would not impair the public’s right to view 
or scrutinize this lawsuit, this factor weighs in favor of nondisclosure.  Moreover, 
“the public generally has a strong interest in protecting the identities of sexual assault 
victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”  
Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195.  
Finally, [t]he Second Circuit directed district courts to evaluate “whether there 
are any alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff.” 
Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190 (citing Roe v. Aware Woman Center for Choice, 
Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 687 (11th Cir. 2001)): 
The only justification the defendants offer for stripping Roe of her 
privacy is the argument that they will not be able to adequately conduct 
discovery without knowing her true identity. However, that argument 
is eviscerated by Roe’s offer to disclose her name to the defendants for 
discovery purposes on condition that they do not disclose it to the 
general public. That is a reasonable way to reconcile the competing 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 4-1     Filed 08/20/19     Page 6 of 7

interests, and the district court can enter an appropriate protective order. 
The district court should have granted Roe’s motion to proceed 
anonymously.   
 
Here, Plaintiff will cooperate with the court and the Defendants and reveal 
Plaintiff’s true identity to defendants for discovery purposes on the condition that 
Defendants do not disclose Plaintiff’s name to the general public. 
III. CONCLUSION 
The balancing factors articulated by the Second Circuit weigh in favor of 
protecting Plaintiff’s identity by allowing her to proceed anonymously.  For the 
foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion for 
Leave to Proceed Anonymously.
