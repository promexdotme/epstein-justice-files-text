within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida, within the boundaries of the United

Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he employed for this 
purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN, conspired with these other two, and 
others, to solicit young women of the type Defendant EPSTEIN preferred, blonde, attractive 
in appearance, and younger than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification for him by 
engaging in acts of prostitution. 
10. 
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal conspiracy to 
solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including the Plaintiff, here in Palm Beach

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2009   Page 3 of 5
11. 
From about June, 2003 until on or about February, 2005, Defendants 
EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to come to Defendant 
EPSTEIN's home and provide Defendant EPSTEIN with "massages" which escalated into 
sexual encounters between Defendant EPSTEIN and the Plaintiff designed to fulfill his 
unnatural sexual desires for young women or even younger girls who were minors. These 
acts included Defendant EPSTEIN's request that he wanted the encounter to be like a 
"porn video." Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for the Plaintiff to say, including calling 
out his name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual act "harder,"while he touched 
the Plaintiffs vagina with a vibrator or with his fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in 
the presence of the Plaintiff after demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in 
provocative sexual poses. Defendant EPSTEIN would pay the Plaintiff a fee of $200 on 
each occasion after he ejaculated while masturbating in the presence of the Plaintiff. 
12. 
Defendant EPSTEIN touched Plaintiffs vagina, or penetrated Plaintiffs 
vagina, using his fingers and/or a vibrator on multiple occasions, during the time that 
Plaintiff was a minor, causing personal injury to her. 
13. 
In violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422(b),Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN 
knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to engage in acts of prostitution, when 
the Plaintiff was under the age of 18, approximately on or about the following dates that 
Plaintiff can document based on payments received: 6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04, 6/7/04, 
7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04 and 11/9/04. In addition, Plaintiff believes that 
there were as many as 10 to 20 other occasions during this time frame that Defendant 
EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform prostitution services, all during the time 
that she was a minor.

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2009   Page 4 of 5
14. 
Plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 
§2255(a) for each of the acts of prostitution set forth above for which Defendants solicited 
her, $150,000 for each violation, for a total range of damages between $1.5 million dollars 
to $4.5 million dollars, jointly and severally, and a reasonable attorney's fees and costs, as 
permitted by the statute. 
15. 
Defendant EPSTEIN has made an agreement with the United States 
Attorney's Office to not contest liability for claims brought exclusively pursuant to 18 U .S.C. 
§2255, in exchange for avoiding federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. §2422(b), which 
provides a sentence of 10 years for each violation of the law. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment in her favor, and a jury trial on all issues 
so triable as of right.
