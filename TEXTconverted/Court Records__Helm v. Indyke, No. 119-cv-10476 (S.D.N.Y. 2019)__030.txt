Re:      Helm v. Indyke et al., 
Case No. 19-cv-10476-PGG 
Dear Judge Gardephe, 
Pursuant to Individual Rule IV(D), Plaintiff Teresa Helm hereby requests oral argument 
on Defendants’ motion to dismiss her complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  As Plaintiff argues in her memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants’ motion, 
Defendants seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint in its entirety based on the incorrect contention 
that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely.  But Plaintiff’s claims are timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 
§ 215(8)(a) and the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.  Further, Defendants’ 
motion “to dismiss” Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages is procedurally improper and 
substantively incorrect.  Because Defendants seek the extreme remedy of complete dismissal of 
Plaintiff’s complaint, Plaintiff requests oral argument on Defendants’ motion.   
Respectfully submitted, 
 
/s/ Joshua I. Schiller
