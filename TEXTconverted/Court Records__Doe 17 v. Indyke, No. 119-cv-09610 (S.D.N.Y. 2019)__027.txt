Re:
Jane Doe 17 v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, et al., 1:19-cv-09610 (PAE) 
Dear Judge Engelmayer: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (named herein as “Joint Personal Representative[s] of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation, Financial Trust Company, Inc., NES, LLC, Laurel, 
Inc., Maple, Inc., LSJE, LLC, HBRK Associates, Inc., Nautilus, Inc., Cypress, Inc., and JEGE, 
Inc. (together, “Defendants”) in the referenced action.  We write to respectfully request that the 
Court vacate its Order dated November 8, 2019 (ECF #25) granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Proceed 
Anonymously (the “Motion”) (ECF #24) filed earlier that day.  The basis for this request is that 
Your Honor’s Order dated November 5, 2019 (ECF #21) provides Defendants through 
December 21, 2019 to respond to Plaintiff’s Motion.    
Defendants did not have an opportunity to respond to Plaintiff’s Motion.  Defendants do not 
object to Plaintiff proceeding anonymously to prevent the disclosure of her identity to the 
general public.  However, Defendants seek the opportunity to be heard so the relief granted on 
Plaintiff’s Motion ensures Plaintiff may protect her anonymity without jeopardizing Defendants’ 
fundamental right to fully and fairly defend against this action.   
Plaintiffs’ counsel does not consent to this request. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
