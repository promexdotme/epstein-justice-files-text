BRIEF PURSUANT TO COURT’S MARCH 17, 2021 ORDER  
COME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, and hereby submit this brief pursuant to 
the Court’s March 17, 2021 Order. 
DISCUSSION 
The Court’s March 17, 2021 Order requests that the Estate address whether this case 
should be: (i) designated as complex, and (ii) assigned to the same judge as Case No. ST-2020-
CV-00014 to avoid delay or inconsistent rulings.   
The Court should not designate this matter complex.  A “complex” case “requires 
exceptional judicial management to avoid placing unnecessary burdens on the court or the 
litigants and to expedite the case, keep costs reasonable, and promote effective decision making 
by the court, the parties, and counsel.”  V.I. R. Civ. P. 92(a).  This is not such a case.  Rather, 
it is a simple, one (1) issue dispute—whether Maxwell is entitled to indemnification of legal 
fees.  Moreover, the Rule 92(c) factors do not weigh in favor of complex designation: the action

does not involve a large number of parties, claims, or claimants; the case does not require 
special expertise or case processing by the Complex Litigation Division judge or staff; and the 
case does not implicate the various potential efficiencies of coordinated proceedings.  
Nor would coordination of this matter with Case No. ST-2020-CV-00014 (the “CICO 
action”) significantly advance judicial efficiency.  As noted above, this matter is a simple one, 
based on a nine (9) page complaint asserting three (3) indemnification claims and seeking as 
its sole remedy indemnification of legal fees and costs.  The pending motion to dismiss in this 
matter raises two (2) arguments.  By contrast, the Government’s proposed Second Amended 
Complaint in the CICO action is seventy-six (76) pages long, asserts twenty-six (26) CICO 
claims, alleges a multi-decade long criminal enterprise, and seeks a laundry list of remedies, 
including forfeiture, divestiture, the dissolution of entities, injunctions, revocation of licenses, 
receivership, monetary penalties, and punitive damages.  The Defendants’ motion to dismiss 
the Amended Complaint raises at least ten (10) separate legal issues, none of which overlap 
with the issues raised in the motion to dismiss in this matter.  Given the distinct nature of the 
claims and legal issues presented in the two matters, there is little risk of inconsistent rulings 
should the cases remain assigned to different judges.  Nor are there issues of delay in either 
matter that would be alleviated by coordination of both matters before a single judge. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, the Court should not designate this matter complex nor 
assign the case to the same judge assigned to the CICO action.
