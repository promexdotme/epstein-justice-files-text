Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz 
Complaint 
14. 
In fulfillment of their obligations to two Epstein-victim clients, BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS and PAUL G. CASSELL filed and have been aggressively prosecuting a legal 
action in the Federal District Court as previously described in Paragraph 6. 
15. 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G. CASSELL on behalf of two additional 
Epstein-victim clients sought the agreement of the federal government to permit those clients to 
intervene in the already pending CVRA action. 
The government declined to agree to the 
intervention, thus requiring EDWARDS and CASSELL to file legal pleadings seeking a Court 
Order permitting intervention on the basis of specifically alleged factual allegations. 
16. 
Among the factual allegations made by EDWARDS and CASSELL were 
allegations that Defendant, DERSHOWITZ, had knowledge of and participation in Epstein's 
criminal conduct. 
17. 
Immediately following the filing ofv./hat the Defendant, DERSHOWITZ, knew to 
be an entirely proper and ,vell-founded pleading, DERSHOWITZ initiated a massive public 
media assault on the reputation and character of BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G. 
CASSELL accusing them of intentionally lying in their filing, of having leveled knowingly false 
accusations against the Defendant, DERSHOWITZ, without ever conducting any investigation of 
the credibility of the accusations, and of having acted unethically to the extent that their willful 
misconduct warranted and required disbannent. 
18. 
The details of Defendant, DERSHOWITZ'S character assassination 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G. CASSELL are typified by the contents of the CNN 
interview available to be accessed on the internet at:

Complaint 
http://www.cnn.com/2 015/ 01/ o 5/ europe /prince-andrew-sex-a buse-all egatio ns /index.html# 
That interview is incorporated herein by reference. 
19. 
The same or substantially identical accusations of deliberate misconduct and 
unethical behavior warranting disbannent of the Plaintiffs were repeated by the Defendant, 
DERSHOWITZ, in multiple nationally televised interviews, in statements to and repeated by 
national and international print news sources, and various other forms nationally and 
internationally. 
20. 
The Defendant, DERSHOWITZ'S statements were false and known by him to be 
false at the time they were made. DERSHOWITZ was speaking from his Miami residence at the 
time he made the false and defamatory statements. 
21. 
Alternatively, DERSHOWITZ made the statements in reckless disregard of their 
truth or falsity, intending that the statements would provide support for DERSHOWITZ'S false 
protestations of his own innocence and direct attention away from DERSHOWITZ'S personal 
knowledge of and involvement in Epstein's criminal conduct and the subsequent cover up of that 
misconduct. 
22. 
DERSHOWITZ'S statements were and are defamatory per se directly attacking 
the fitness of the Plaintiffs to engage in the honored profession of the practice of law. 
23. 
DERSHOWITZ acted in willful, wanton, reckless, and intentional disregard of the 
rights of the Plaintiffs and under such circumstances as to warrant the imposition of punitive 
damages.

Complaint 
24. 
As the statements made by DERSHOWITZ are defamatory per se, injury to the 
Plaintiffs is presumed as a matter oflaw.

DERSHOWITZ, for compensatory damages, costs, pre and post-judgment interest, and such
