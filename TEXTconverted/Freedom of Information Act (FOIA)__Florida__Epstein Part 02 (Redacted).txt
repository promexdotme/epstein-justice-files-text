Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Mr. Krischer: 
I write to you to confirm our meeting with'Lanna on June 14, 2006. It is our hope 
that in light of the recent developments in this case which we have set forth in our letter 
of June 5, 2006, our meetings, and herein, in particulaf the fact that there is no sex 
alleged, this case can be disposed of with, at most, an informal agreement, or more 
appropriately, no charges being filed at all. 
As you know, it was only at the June 1, 2006 meeting, after eight months of 
investigation, that you and I both learned, for the very first time, and I believe to our 
collective disbelief, that the allegation of the girl did not raise the slightest hint of actual 
sex. Up until that point, we had all been laboring under the assumption this girl had 
alleged multiple sexual encounters with my client. In fact, as you are aware, it was with 
this in mind that we hired George Slattery, a highly respected polygraph expert, who 
unequivocally confirmed our client's long held position both that there was no sex and 
that the girl clearly stated she was 18 years old. Since, we now know with certainty that 
there are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this 
girl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not 
bring a "touching case" — NO sex, NO charge — in fashioning an appropriate resolution to 
this matter. 
As we have discussed many times, the girl's credibility is highly questionable and 
has been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (1) repeatedly 
changing her age on her web page (first 17, then 16, then 15) and posting graphic nude 
and suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,

smoking, and having sex; (3) being observed by the police as clearly on drugs; and, (5) 
running away to an unsafe drug location. With this background, it has certainly taken a 
while to sort things out, but, the agreed to facts of this case are that: (1) this girl, was 
driven to my clients' home with the express and sole purpose of providing a topless 
massage; (2) she told my client she was 18 years old; (3) she received her agreed upon 
two hundred dollars; (4) before leaving she wrote down her phone number and stated next 
time she wanted to bring her twin sister along; (5) my client never saw her again; and, 
most importantly (6) no sex occurred. It was only several MONTHS later, that we are led 
to believe, one of her parents, both of whom have criminal records for fraud, contacted 
the police. 
Finally, as you consider your options, I quite frankly think it unfair to give much 
weight to the pressure being brought to bear by law enforcement. Their comments which 
have been brought to my attention certainly indicate, at a minimum, a lack of objectivity. 
With all this in mind, I believe that it is only just, especially now that we are both certain 
there was no sex involved, that your office opt NOT to prosecute this case. However, 
given the totality of the circumstances, coupled with the fact that a "Google search" is 
now a "forever" reference on any job application, I believe that the girls involved, my 
client, and all concerned would be better served with at worst an informal resolution of 
this matter. Certainly it seems preferable to filing a charge that we all currently concede 
would likely not succeed if brought to trial. I appreciate the personal attention you have 
given to this matter, and look forward to you response. 
Very ty y yours,

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
As a follow up to our meeting of June 1, 2006, held in an attempt to resolve this matter, 
we write to address the following issues which have arisen: (1) the risk, were the client to plead 
to aggravated assault in Florida, that he might be subject to sex-offender registration statutes in 
other jurisdictions, now or in the future; (2) the nature of the charge of felony "aggravated 
assault with intent to commit a felony," and how it does not reflect the allegations herein; and, (3) 
whether a felony conviction itself is justified based on the available evidence. 
At the outset of our June 1, 2006 meeting, we were mindful that an understanding had 
been reached with prior counsel. It was reached, however, with the clear and joint understanding 
that the client would not be subjected to sex offender registration requirements in any state or 
foreign jurisdiction. Moreover, the limited time provided did not allow for an opportunity to 
conduct an even cursory investigation or research into the ramifications. Were any charge to be 
brought, having now learned of the serious danger a plea to felony aggravated assault presents 
with regard to sex offender registration, coupled with the facts presented at our meeting and 
outlined below, we strongly believe that a plea to misdemeanor solicitation is the more 
appropriate resolution. As -we discussed, this could include an agreed upon allocution, as we are 
mindful of your concern about labeling the girls "prostitutes." In this regard, as we discussed, the 
law and relevant statute are clear that the complaining witness need not be a "prostitute" in order 
to satisfy the elements of the offense.

An Aggravated Assault Conviction Might Subject the Client to Sex Registration 
There is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated assault, F.S.A. § 784.021(1)(b), will expose 
the client to registration obligations under the Megan's Law statutes, either as currently written, 
or as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but 
not limited to, ones where he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the 
plea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious 
behavior under F.S.A. § 800.04 or sexual battery under F.S.A. § 794.011. 
As my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious 
unintended result of a plea to felony aggravated assault is the possible registration in his place of 
residency. The Virgin Islands statute, 14 V.I.C. § 1722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to 
register upon a "person convicted ... on or after July 1, 1994 of a criminal offense against a  
minor". 14 V.I.C. § 1722(a) (emphasis added). Under § 1722 (c), "a person convicted ... in a 
federal, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under 
this statute," Failure to register is a crime. 14 V.I.C. § 1722(d). Further, while the Virgin Islands 
registry is currently accessible only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about 
opening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May 15, 2006, at 
http://www.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.plfarticle_home7id-17296624,  I 
Tinder current law, a plea to aggravated assault will also likely subject the client to 
registration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York 
under the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grow. In 
1999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March 11, 
2002, seven new offenses were added. 
A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be 
subject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated assault - Oklahoma and 
Montana. 
Oklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of assault with intent to commit a felony, in 
violation of 21 Old. St. Ann. § 681 "if the offense involved sexual assault" See, 57 Old. St. Ann. § 582 (A). 
Oklahoma law requires the registration, too, of persons convicted of an offense outside the jurisdiction which, if 
committed in the state, would constitute a 'registrable offense. 57 Oki. St. Ann. § 582(B). 
Likewise, Montana requires registration of both sexual offenders and violent offenders. 'Violent offenders" 
include persons convicted of any violent offense, which is expressly defined to include "aggravated assault" under 
MCA 45-05-202, or "any violation of a law of another state reasonably equivalent" to that crime. MCA 46-23-
502(9).

Ms. Lanna Belohlavek 
June 5, 2006

In New York, a person must register as a sex offender if they are required to register in the 
jurisdiction of conviction or, if convicted in a foreign jurisdiction, his conviction there meets "all 
the essential elements" of New York's enumerated sexual offenses. See, N.Y. Corr. Law §§ 168-
1(2)(a)(1), (d), (3). In spite of the statutory reference to "essential elements," some New York 
courts have looked at the facts underlying the offense of conviction, rather than the formal 
elements of the offense, in determining whether registration is required. Each finding that a 
defendant was required to register on the basis of the underlying conduct even though the 
essential elements test was not satisfied. See, People v. Burden, 6 Misc.3d 1033(aXSup. Ct. 
Bronx Cty. 2005); People v. Milian, 189 Misc.2d 419, 730 N.Y.S.2d 392 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. 
2001). 
The same serious concern arises in other states, including California and Colorado, which 
authorize courts to look behind the plea, and beyond the formal elements of the offense of 
conviction, and enable them on a case by case basis to determine if registration is required. 
Like New York, California requires an individual to register if they are required to register 
in the state of conviction, or pursuant to CA Penal Code § 290(a)(2)(D)(1) if that individual ". . . 
since July 1, 1944, has been, or is hereafter convicted in any other court, including any state, 
federal, or military court, of any offense that, if committed or attempted in this state, would have 
been punishable as one or more of the offenses described in subparagraph (A)". The wording of 
the statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been 
punishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at 
the formal elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses 
include commission of "any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body of child" where the 
child is "14 or 15 years" of age and "that person is at least 10 years older than the child" "with 
the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that 
person or the child". CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (I). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may 
subject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California. 
Colorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within 
five business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other 
things, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving 
sexual behavior (or an attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they 
are required to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A. §§ 16-22-103, 
16-22-108. 
With regard to Florida, as you know, it is reasonably clear that under Florida's current 
version of Megan's Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 
in Florida since it is not included among the state's enumerated "sexual offender" offenses. 5eq

F.S.A. §§ 943.0435, 784.021. However, the offense of sexual battery is on the list, as well as the 
charge of lewd and lascivious behavior, so there is no assurance that, in the future, a Florida 
prosecutor or court will not take the position that, where the aggravated assault is combined with 
what some states have labeled a "sexually motivated intent" registration is required. 
Moreover, as you indicated at our meeting, there is no guarantee that the Florida 
legislature will not expand the category of persons subject to Megan's law, and expressly make 
persons convicted of aggravated assault subject to the law, especially where the felony the actor 
had the intent to commit is a sexual offense, and the victim is a minor. The trend today is 
towards expansion, not contraction, of these kinds of statutes, arid as you noted, Florida will be 
no exception. See, 	
"Sex Offenders; No More Escaping Registration," 36 McGeorge L. Rev 
822 2005 (Over the last twenty years expanded registration requirements, enhanced penalties for 
failure to register, and public notification provisions have enlarged the scope of sex offender 
registration laws); see news articles of just this past week infra describing many of the 
proscriptions being adopted around the nation. And, the ex post facto clause stands as no 
significant bar. See Smith y. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003) (upholding Alaska Sex Offender 
Registration Act against a challenge that its application to persons whose offenses were 
committed prior to its enactment would violate the ex post facto clause). If this trend continues, 
as it likely will, the client will almost certainly be subject to sex offender registration. 
Even if the client is not and will never be subject to registration requirements under 
Florida's laws, a plea to aggravated assault under the circumstances of this case could subject 
him to Megan's Law requirements in other jurisdictions. Thus, if the client pleads guilty to the 
proposed aggravated assault charge, there is a grave risk that under existing state and Virgin 
Islands law quite apart from future expansion or expansive construction of those laws - ho will 
be subject to sex offender registration requirements and/or criminal exposure for failure to 
register. There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or 
expansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so. See, e.g„, Cherry 
Hill Sex Offender Ordinance Upheld, Courier Post, June 1, 2006, at

2 	This article discusses a decision handed down by a municipal court judge in New Jersey during the course 
of our meeting_ That decision upheld a zoning restriction on sex offenders living within 2500 feet of schools, parks, 
playgrounds, public libraries, or day care centers. While other jurisdictions' zoning laws currently restrict such 
individuals from living within 1000 feet of these institutions, were they to follow the lead of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, 
the client would most certainly be faced with the added burdens of selling his residences and moving in order to be in 
compliance with the law.

Indeed, as you recognized during our meeting, many people who were advised by 
competent counsel to plead guilty to offenses when registration was not required have now been 
horrified to find themselves subjected to registration laws enacted or expanded after their guilty 
pleas, without any recourse. See, Smith v. Doe, supra, 538 U.S. 84. Finally, although there is 
some risk that even a plea to a misdemeanor charge could trigger registration in some 
jurisdictions, our research suggests that this risk is considerably lower for a misdemeanor plea 
than for a felony plea. 
H. 	
Aggravated Assault is Generally Considered A Violent Felony And Does Not Apply to 
the Facts of This Case 
Assault is generally considered an act of force. It "create[s] in the victims a well founded 
fear of imminent violence." Velasouez v. State, 654 So. 2d 1227, 1228 (Fla.2d DCA 1995). The 
general public is certainly not aware of Florida's unique nuanced definition. Indeed, as you will 
agree, in common usage, aggravated assault, on its face sounds inherently violent. Thus, at the 
very least, most people will consider an aggravated assault charge, even of the "intent to commit 
a felony" variety, to be a violent crime. In this regard, undifferentiated aggravated assault is one 
of only four crimes listed in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report "violent crime" category.3  
More importantly, as noted, this crime clearly does not reflect what allegedly occurred 
since there has been no suggestion that a threat of serous bodily harm was made or a deadly 
weapon used. In addition, most pleas are "downward" — the defendant agrees to waive his right 
to trial in return for the prosecution's offer of a downward departure in charging or sentencing. 
Further, in the typical case a plea involves crimes that bear a close resemblance to the underlying 
events. The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated assault, thus a plea to 
same would be inappropriate.

III. Since the Meeting on February 16, 2006 When Misdemeanor Charges Were Initially 
discussed, the State's Case has Gotten Considerably Weaker 
At the February 16, 2006 meeting, you suggested the Office was investigating a felony 
and you indicated you would consider pleading it down to a misdemeanor. As you are aware, 
since then much has happened which makes the alleged case considerably weaker and 
undermines the credibility of the witnesses upon which it was based. Indeed as you already 
know the following information has come to light severely damaging the reliability of the 
witnesses: (i).
background, including a history of theft, confessions and repeated 
denials of stealing from employers and customers, lying about her age, sexual promiscuity, and 
prostitution; (ii r 	" boastful admission of drug use, underage drinking, sexual 
activity, shoplifting, wild exaggeration of her income (at least $250,000), representing herself 
naked on a website and as 17 years old, then 16, then 15, only changing it to her truthful age, 
coincidentally four days before the last scheduled grand jury. In addition, as you have 
acknowledged, she was found in an inappropriate place in Georgia after the police were called 
when she ran away from home. This is separate and apart from the Florida police report 
presented to you, detailing her being dropped off by the local drug dealer at 5:45 a.m., only two 
days after returning to West Palm Beach, and being described by the officer as clearly on drugs; 
and (iii) both of 	
parents' criminal history of fraud. 
In stark contrast to this is the fact that, as we indicated at the meeting, the client has 
passed both a rigorous lie detector test, conducted by the most highly qualified expert we could 
find, one whose reputation is beyond reproach, and provided you copies of two psycho-sexual 
evaluations prepared by experts that you have agreed are well-recognized and accepted by the 
State.

Conclusion 
Under the circumstances of this case a plea to felony aggravated assault is both 
unwarranted and presents a grave risk the client will be brandished a sex offender, bearing the 
attendant burdens inherent with that classification. In light of this, and the credibility issues 
presented by the complaining witnesses, combined with the client's two psycho-sexual 
evaluations and lie detector tests, we believe that at the very most, a misdemeanor plea to 
solicitation is appropriate.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
As a follow up to our meeting of June 1, 2006, held in an attempt to resolve this matter, 
we write to address the following issues which have arisen: (1) the risk, were the client to plead 
to aggravated assault in Florida, that he might be subject to sex-offender registration statutes in 
other jurisdictions, now or in the future; (2) the nature of the charge of felony "aggravated 
assault with intent to commit a felony," and how it does not reflect the allegations herein; and, (3) 
whether a felony conviction itself is justified based on the available evidence. 
At the outset of our June 1, 2006 meeting, we were mindful that an understanding had 
been reached with prior counsel. It was reached, however, with the clear and joint understanding 
that the client would not be subjected to sex offender registration requirements in any state or 
foreign jurisdiction. Moreover, the limited time provided did not allow for an opportunity to 
conduct an even cursory investigation or research into the ramifications. Were any charge to be 
brought, having now learned of the serious danger a plea to felony aggravated assault presents 
with regard to sex offender registration, coupled with the facts presented at our meeting and 
outlined below, we strongly believe that a plea to misdemeanor solicitation is the more 
appropriate resolution. As we discussed, this could include an agreed upon allocution, as we are 
mindful of your concern about labeling the girls "prostitutes." In this regard, as we discussed, the 
law and relevant statute are clear that the complaining witness need not be a "prostitute" in order 
to satisfy the elements of the offense.

An Aggravated Assault Conviction Might Subject the Client to Sex-Registration 
There is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated assault, F.S.A. § 784.021(1)(b), will expose 
the client to registration obligations under the Megan's Law statutes, either as currently written, 
or as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but 
not limited to, ones where he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the 
plea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious 
behavior under F.S.A. § 800.04 or sexual battery under F.S.A. § 794.011. 
As my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious 
unintended result of a plea to felony aggravated assault is the possible registration in his place of 
residency. The Virgin Islands statute, 14 V.I.C. § 1722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to 
register upon a "person convicted ... on or after July 1, 1994 of a criminal offense against a 
minor". 14 V.I.C. § 1722(a) (emphasis added). Under § 1722 (c), "a person convicted ... in a 
federal, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under 
this statute." Failure to register is a crime. 14 V.I.C. § 1722(d). Further, while the Virgin Islands 
registry is currently accessible only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about 
opening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May 15, 2006, at 
http://wwwvirginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article_home?id=17296624.1  
Under current law, a plea to aggravated assault will also likely subject the client to 
registration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York 
under the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grow. In 
1999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March 11, 
2002, seven new offenses were added. 
A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be 
subject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated assault - Oklahoma and 
Montana. 
Oklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of assault with intent to commit a felony, in 
violation of 21 Okl. St. Ann. § 681 "if the offense involved sexual assault." See, 57 Okl. St. Ann. § 582 (A). 
Oklahoma law requires the registration, too, of persons convicted of an offense outside the jurisdiction which, if 
committed in the state, would constitute a registrable offense. 57 Okl. St. Ann. § 582(B). 
Likewise, Montana requires registration of both sexual offenders and violent offenders. "Violent offenders" 
include persons convicted of any violent offense, which is expressly defined to include "aggravated assault" under 
MCA 45-05-202, or "any violation of a law of another state ... reasonably equivalent" to that crime. MCA 46-23-
502(9).

In New York, a person must register as a sex offender if they are required to register in the 
jurisdiction of conviction or, if convicted in a foreign jurisdiction, his conviction there meets "all 
the essential elements" of New York's enumerated sexual offenses. See, N.Y. Corr. Law §§ 168-
1(2)(a)(I), (d), (3). In spite of the statutory reference to "essential elements," some New York 
courts have looked at the facts underlying the offense of conviction, rather than the formal 
elements of the offense, in determining whether registration is required. Each finding that a 
defendant was required to register on the basis of the underlying conduct even though the 
essential elements test was not satisfied. See, People v. Burden, 6 Misc.3d 1033(a)(Sup. Ct. 
Bronx Cty. 2005); People v. Milian, 189 Misc.2d 419, 730 N.Y.S.2d 392 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. 
2001). 
The same serious concern arises in other states, including California and Colorado, which 
authorize courts to look behind the plea, and beyond the formal elements of the offense of 
conviction, and enable them on a case by case basis to determine if registration is required. 
Like New York, California requires an individual to register if they are required to register 
in the state of conviction, or pursuant to CA Penal Code § 290(a)(2)(D)(I) if that individual ". . . 
since July 1, 1944, has been, or is hereafter convicted in any other court, including any state, 
federal, or military court, of any offense that, if committed or attempted in this state, would have 
been punishable as one or more of the offenses described in subparagraph (A)". The wording of 
the statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been 
punishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at 
the formal elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses 
include commission of "any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child" where the 
child is "14 or 15 years" of age and "that person is at least 10 years older than the child" "with 
the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that 
person or the child". CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (1). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may 
subject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California. 
Colorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within 
five business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other 
things, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving 
sexual behavior (or an attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they 
are required to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A. §§ 16-22-103, 
16-22-108. 
With regard to Florida, as you know, it is reasonably clear that under Florida's current 
version of Megan's Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 
in Florida since it is not included among the state's enumerated "sexual offender" offenses. See

F.S.A. §§ 943.0435, 784.021. However, the offense of sexual battery is on the list, as well as the 
charge of lewd and lascivious behavior, so there is no assurance that, in the future, a Florida 
prosecutor or court will not take the position that, where the aggravated assault is combined with 
what some states have labeled a "sexually motivated intent" registration is required. 
Moreover, as you indicated at our meeting, there is no guarantee that the Florida 
legislature will not expand the category of persons subject to Megan's law, and expressly make 
persons convicted of aggravated assault subject to the law, especially where the felony the actor 
had the intent to commit is a sexual offense, and the victim is a minor. The trend today is 
towards expansion, not contraction, of these kinds of statutes, and as you noted, Florida will be 
no exception. See, e.g., "Sex Offenders; No More Escaping Registration," 36 McGeorge L. Rev 
822 2005 (Over the last twenty years expanded registration requirements, enhanced penalties for 
failure to register, and public notification provisions have enlarged the scope of sex offender 
registration laws); see news articles of just this past week infra describing many of the 
proscriptions being adopted around the nation. And, the ex post facto clause stands as no 
significant bar. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003) (upholding Alaska Sex Offender 
Registration Act against a challenge that its application to persons whose offenses were 
committed prior to its enactment would violate the ex post facto clause). If this trend continues, 
as it likely will, the client will almost certainly be subject to sex offender registration. 
Even if the client is not and will never be subject to registration requirements under 
Florida's laws, a plea to aggravated assault under the circumstances of this case could subject 
him to Megan's Law requirements in other jurisdictions. Thus, if the client pleads guilty to the 
proposed aggravated assault charge, there is a grave risk that under existing state and Virgin 
Islands law — quite apart from future expansion or expansive construction of those laws — he will 
be subject to sex offender registration requirements and/or criminal exposure for failure to 
register. There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or 
expansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so. See, e.g., Cherry 
Hill Sex Offender Ordinance Upheld, Courier Post, June 1, 2006, at

This article discusses a decision handed down by a municipal court judge in New Jersey during the course 
of our meeting. That decision upheld a zoning restriction on sex offenders ►iving within 2500 feet of schools, parks, 
playgrounds, public libraries, or day care centers. While other jurisdictions' zoning laws currently restrict such 
individuals from living within 1000 feet of these institutions, were they to follow the lead of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, 
the client would most certainly be faced with the added burdens of selling his residences and moving in order to be in 
compliance with the law.

Indeed, as you recognized during our meeting, many people who were advised by 
competent counsel to plead guilty to offenses when registration was not required have now been 
horrified to find themselves subjected to registration laws enacted or expanded after their guilty 
pleas, without any recourse. See, Smith v. Doe, supra, 538 U.S. 84. Finally, although there is 
some risk that even a plea to a misdemeanor charge could trigger registration in some 
jurisdictions, our research suggests that this risk is considerably lower for a misdemeanor plea 
than for a felony plea. 
II. 	
Aggravated Assault is Generally Considered A Violent Felony And Does Not Apply to 
the Facts of This Case 
Assault is generally considered an act of force. It "create[s] in the victims a well founded 
fear of imminent violence." Velasquez v. State, 654 So. 2d 1227, 1228 (Fla.2d DCA 1995). The 
general public is certainly not aware of Florida's unique nuanced definition. Indeed, as you will 
agree, in common usage, aggravated assault, on its face sounds inherently violent. Thus, at the 
very least, most people will consider an aggravated assault charge, even of the "intent to commit 
a felony" variety, to be a violent crime. In this regard, undifferentiated aggravated assault is one 
of only four crimes listed in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report "violent crime" category.3  
More importantly, as noted, this crime clearly does not reflect what allegedly occurred 
since there has been no suggestion that a threat of serous bodily harm was made or a deadly 
weapon used. In addition, most pleas are "downward" — the defendant agrees to waive his right 
to trial in return for the prosecution's offer of a downward departure in charging or sentencing. 
Further, in the typical case a plea involves crimes that bear a close resemblance to the underlying 
events. The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated assault, thus a plea to 
same would be inappropriate.

Narrative 
On 11/24/05 at about 21:49 hours I went to 411 Christopher Court in reference to a 
suspicious person. I met with 	
who stated she has two juvenile daughters. 
Tonight she noticed they went across the street to a vacant house with some boys. When she 
went to check on them she caught the boys drinking alcohol. She knew the boys were juveniles 
so she took the alcohol (tequila) from them she said a couple of the boys ran off. Juvenile one 
got in his silver Mitsubishi and went to the end of the street. He then stopped infront of her 
house. The juvenile stated he wanted his tequila back and he would come back at midnight. 
is concerned juvenile one might return and damage her guests vehicles. Mrs. 
asked her juveniles who the subject was and they were unfamiliar. I gave Mrs. 
a case card. I returned into service with no further incident. I informed morning watch 
of this address for an extra patrol for tonight only.

Narrative 
While on patrol, I was dispatched to a missing person call at 411 Christopher Court. I arrived 
and made contact with the caller/mother of the missing juvenile female, L 	
J. She 
stated her juvenile daughter left yesterday for school, and had not returned. - 	
. told me she 
had spoken with her daughter around 1900 and she was going to the high school basketball 
game. Later on that night, some of the juveniles's friends called the mother and informed her 
they had not seen the juvenile at the game. 
When the juvenile didn't return this morning, 
 	
said she became worried and started to 
contact some of her daughter's friends. They told her they heard she was handing hanging 
around with Mr. Byron Elrod in an area known as "The Cur which is located off Old Donaldson 
and Highway 140. "The Cut" is a known drug area in the county. I completed a missing person's 
checklist and obtained a recent picture of the juvenile. I called Detective Allen and informed her 
of the situation. The mother did not want a juvenile complaint filed. I issued f 	
1 a case card 
and asked her to call if she found any more information regarding her daughter. D/S Ballard and 
I left the residence and returned to service. 
After patrolling Old Donaldson Rd and the Crissler Street area, we were unable to locate any 
additional information as to the whereabouts of the female. Around 1200, I received a telephone 
call from - 	
stating that she had found her daughter, and she was located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments off Belts Ferry Rd. The mother told me a friend of the family was going to pick the 
female up, and escort her back to the parents house. I told 7. 	
to call 911 when her daughter 
returned and a deputy would be sent out to check on the well being of the juvenile. 
When the juvenile returned Sgt Thompson met with the juvenile and parents at the house. The 
Juvenile stated she had been drinking and had done some drugs last night, and that she had 
been scared to call her parents. She then went to a friends house located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments and spent the night.

Dear Lanna: 
Guy has asked me to provide you with the research on why it makes a difference whether Mr. 
Epstein pleads "nolo contendere " or "guilty". As you can see from the enclosed statute, a plea of 
"nolo contendere" is not admissible as an "admission against interest" in a subsequent civil case. 
A plea of guilty — even a so-called "best interest" plea of guilty — is admissible. That is the only 
real legal difference. If you need anything further, please do not hesitate to call me or Guy. 
Sincerely,

Re: 	
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Lanna: 
I am in receipt of your letter, of today's date, confirming the offer of 
settlement in the Jeffrey Epstein matter. Please allow this response to 
serve as my acceptance with the following clarifications: 
1) 
You have agreed to allow Mr. Epstein to enter a Guilty Best Interest 
Plea. Additionally, you have agreed to review authority I provide 
concerning the effect a "guilty" plea has on a civil matter and in good faith 
consider allowing Mr. Epstein to plea "No Contest" 
2) 
Regarding, the supervised contact, your letter refers to an 
"approved" adult. In our meeting today, you did not mention that the 
supervisor had to be approved. I agree that the supervision must be by an 
adult, other than Ms. Marcinkova and Ms. Kellen, with knowledge of the 
underlying facts. Additionally, I need to confirm that Mr. Epstein may be 
with his goddet.VAeinwithout-su.petvision. 
3) 
You agreed not to object to my selecting a duly licensed and 
experienced psychologist to conduct the evaluation. 
4) 
I accept the provision for payment of the cost of investigation for the 
Palm Beach Police Department as long as the cost is reasonable. 
5) 
Although your correspondence does not mention travel, I am 
confirming your agreement to allow Mr. Epstein to travel for business 
purposes. In line with our discussions, I request that you agree to allow 
Mr. Epstein to travel for philanth

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Daliah: 
Pursuant to our recent conversation and my correspondence of January 
13, 2006 (attached), please allow this letter to reconfirm that I am attorney 
of record for Mr. Epstein. Additionally, I am clarifying that Mr. Alan 
Dershowitz is also counsel for Mr. Epstein. 
Currently, the structure of our representation is that I will be the one in 
communication with you, Lanna Belohlavek and Detective Recarey 
regarding the investigation and prosecution of this matter. Mr. Dershowitz 
remains involved however, at this point, I do not anticipate him contacting 
you, Ms. Belohlavek or Detective Recarey to discuss any issue relevant to 
this investigation. I will notify you if this structure changes. 
Please call me if you have any questions or concerns about Mr. Epstein's 
representation. Additionally, I anticipate hearing back from you on 
Thursday regarding the opportunity for me to meet with you and Lanna 
prior to this case being presented to the Grand Jury. 
I look forward to continuing to work with you on this matter.

Re: 	
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Lanna: 
Thank you for meeting yesterday and allowing Alan and me to address 
your investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Pursuant to our discussion, I am 
enclosing an Incident Report from Victoria Secret outlining three (3) recent 
incidents of theft committed b
I am submitting this Incident Report with the express understanding that it 
will be kept in strict confidence. Specifically, since the Report only 
concerns 
I believe there is no good faith reason, in any 
contact you may have with the store to mention Mr. Epstein's name or the 
investigation (especially in light of reports from multiple witnesses 
indicating Detective Recarey is providing damaging mis-information). 
Please let me know if you have any questions about the report and I will do 
whatever I can to immediately resolve your concerns. 
Additionally, I am enclosing a credit card receipt (with non-relevant 
information redacted) confirming the purchase of the strap-on dildo that 
purchased at Guys and Dolls. It will make clear that when 
the dildo was purchased
was over 18 years old and she 
charged the purchase on Nadia Marcinkova's credit card. Ms. Marcinkova 
had never before been to Guys and Dolls and was taken there by - 
...... who indicated it was her favorite sex shop.

Guy Fronstin, Esq. 
515 North Flagler Drive 
Suite 300 Pavilion 
West Palm Beach, FL 33401 
Dear Mr. Fronstin: 
This is to notify you that certain matters suggesting possible criminal conduct on the part 
of your client, Jeffrey Epstein, will be presented for consideration by the current session of the 
Palm Beach County Grand Jury. You and your client are invited to appear before the Grand 
Jury in the Palm Beach County Courthouse on March 7, 2006 at 9:00 AM, or as soon 
thereafter as they are able to hear you. 
The invitation is extended to provide an opportunity for your client to present any 
personal testimony you may think proper. You should understand, however, that anything your 
client testifies to may be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution. 
In the event you and your client wish to present evidence or testimony of other 
witnesses you must submit a written list of names and addresses of potential witnesses by 
February 16, 2006 and make them available by February 21, 2006 for a sworn statement at 
the State Attorney's Office. Copies of potential physical evidence must be supplied by 
February 16, 2006. Keep in mind that only evidence that is relevant to the incident will 
be presented to the Grand Jury. 
This invitation to your client is not an offer of immunity nor is it an effort to compel your 
client to participate in the Grand Jury proceedings in any way. Any participation on his part 
must be entirely voluntary, and a decision not to participate cannot be used to raise an 
unfavorable presumption against your client. 
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Re: Epstein matter 
Dear Detective Recarey: 
I am sending you this letter in response to the serious concern you raised at our 
meeting regarding an alleged claim that one of our investigators had misrepresented 
himself as a police officer and in fact had actually attempted to impersonate you. As I 
told you neither I nor my client would ever tolerate any such conduct on the part of our 
investigators. With that in mind, I immediately began an inquiry of our staff, and believe 
that the contemporaneous notes taken by our investigator, while attempting to interview 
will provide the necessary explanation for your thoroughly justified 
consternation. It will also, I believe, provide a more troublesome and telling illustration 
of her character. At our meeting, you may recall, _I--also advised you that our 
investigation had discovered at least one of her web sites and I am enclosing some 
examples. You will note that she, herself, has chosen to go by the nickname of "pimp 
juice" and the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent fascination with 
marijuana. This will come as no surprise to you as I'm sure you are already aware of her 
recent Palm Beach arrest for both possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. 
The following raw notes were taken by investigators (one who suffers from a 
quite distinct speech impediment, making, therefore, a truly innocent claim of 
impersonation virtually impossible). Both of them have many years experience in 
conducting defense investigations and debriefing witnesses. They are both well versed in 
the law and extremely sensitive to any potential allegations of wrongdoing especially 
from witnesses who may have their own agendas. In this instance, they were instructed 
to take ' • 	
; statement verbatim because we feared that she, an accomplished 
drama student, might try to mislead them as successfully as she had misled others. They 
were instructed to ask detailed questions to further elucidate her previous 
pronouncements regarding the extreme lengths she would go to as she put it "to be rich, 
no, I mean really, really rich". But as you will read, they never got a chance to ask even a 
single question, and could not for a moment be thought of, as attempting to misrepresent 
themselves as police officers. In fact even though, they are both well prepared and 
seasoned investigators, they were quite shocked at the overwhelming, non-stop barrage of 
profanity being hurled at them at a furious pace and volume from what initially appeared

Re: 	
Jeff Epstein 
Third Party Attorney Fee Payment 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
As you know I represent Mr. Jeff Epstein. Mr. Epstein's house manager, 
Yanush Banasiak, was asked to speak with your office regarding the matter 
that I represent Mr. Epstein on. In anticipation of Mr. Banasiak's meeting 
with your office he decided to retain legal counsel. Yesterday, he met with 
and retained, attorney Michael Salnick, who will be attending Mr. 
Banasiak's statement in your office today at 1:30 p.m. 
Since your questioning of Mr. Banasiak concerns information that he may 
have that arises out of his employment with Mr. Epstein, Mr. Epstein will be 
paying Mr. Banasiak's attorneys fees. I felt it important to notify you of this 
third party attorney fee payment structure and confirm that you have no 
objection. Mr. Epstein would like to wire the payment for Mr. Salnick's 
representation to Mr. Salnick as soon as possible. Therefore, I would 
appreciate your getting back to me today on this issue. 
Very truly yours,

BY DET. RECAREY: 
18 	
Q. 	
Mr. Alessi, I'm Detective Joe Recarey with 
19 	
the Palm Beach P.D. As I explained to you on the 
20 	
telephone, I am conducting an investigation on a former 
21 	
employer of yours. 
22 	
I just spoke with your wife and she told me 
23 	
you guys worked for Mr. Epstein for eight years? 
24 	
A. 	
Yes, she did work for eight years. I 
25 	
worked longer. I was there before my wife came.

1 	
Q. 	
Before your wife came. 
2 	
A. 	
I started full-time with him on January 1, 
3 	
1991, and we both left December 31, 2002. So I worked 
4 	
eleven years exactly. Prior to that, prior to working 
5 	
full-time for him, I worked part-time for him, on-and-off 
6 	
basis. 
7 	
Q. 	
What were your responsibilities? 
8 	
A. 	
In the full-time basis, I started as a 
9 houseman, and I became a major domo and butler and 
10 everything else, driver, and did everything. We both did 
11 all the chores in the house, but I was in charge of the 
12 house. I was above my wife and above the cleaning crew, 
13 the gardners, pool people. So I was house manager, major 
14 	
domo. 
15 	
Q. 	
You would have been the go-to guy for the 
16 	
house? 
17 	
A. 	
Yes. And the one who would get the blame. 
18 	
Q. 	
We are talking about Jeffrey Epstein? 
19 	
A. 	
Of course. 
20 	
Q. 	
Do you remember the address of the house? 
21 	
A. 	
558 El Brillo. 
22 	
Q. 	
Was it in the beginning of the street -- 
23 	
A. 	
At the end of the street, on the left-hand 
24 	
side. 
25 	
Q. 	
We're talking about the same house.

Q. 	
During the time that he was here, you 
2 	
prepared the house, did all the chores. 
3 	
Did you do any of the cleaning? 
4 	
A. 	
Sometimes. Many times. I did -- last two 
5 	
or three years the work was so much that we have to 
6 	
hire 	
we hire a clean-up crew that they came twice a 
7 	
week or once a week, then it was twice a week. Depends 
8 	
upon his schedule, because he did not allow anybody at 
9 	
the house except us when he was in town. So when he was 
10 	
in town, it was just us doing the cleaning and the 
11 	
cooking, the driving, shopping, everything else. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did you stay on property in the guest 
13 	
house? 
14 	
A. 	
Yes and no. We had an apartment right 
15 	
across the bridge. We had an apartment in Tower 1515 on 
16 	
Flagler, and we had an apartment at the house. 
17 	
Q. 	
Why would you stay at the house, then? 
18 	
A. 	
We stay at the house mostly when he was 
19 	
there. When he was not in town, we went home. We went 
20 	
to our apartment. When he was there, it was -- the job 
21 	
was just too much to go home 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock and 
22 	
come back 5 o'clock in the morning. We would just stay 
23 	
and sleep and get up and work. 
24 	
Q. 	
When he was in town, did he receive a lot 
25 	
of guests at the house?

girlfriend. She was our immediate superior. 
	
2 	
Q. 	
Did he have girls come over to give 
3 massages? 
4 	
A. 	
Yes. 
5 	
Q. 	
How many massages would he have in a day? 
6 	
A. 	
Sometimes one, sometimes two, three. 
7 	
Q. 	
Was it the same girl that would come back 
8 	
to do the massages? 
9 	
A. 	
Yeah, yeah. Not the same girl -- I mean 
10 during eleven years, I probably saw a hundred, two 
11 	
hundred different massage therapists. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did they seem young to you? 
13 	
A. 	
No, sir. Mostly no. We saw one or two 
14 	
young ones in the last year. Before that, it was all 
15 	
adults. 
16 	
Q. 	
During your last year when you were working 
17 with him, what do you mean that they looked young? Did 
18 	
they look like they were still in high school? 
19 	
A. 	
I remember one girl was young. We never 
20 	
asked how old she was. It was not in my job. 
21 	
Q. 	
Right. I understand. 
22 	
A. 	
But I imagine she was 16, 17. In my 
23 	
judgment, she was 16, 17. 
24 	
Q. 	
Where would these massages take place? 
25 	
A. 	
All the time it was in his room. Sometimes

it was in the balcony of his quarters. His room has a 
2 	
wraparound balcony facing the pool. So the massages were 
3 	
in the balcony outside in the sun, or inside in his 
4 	
bathroom or her bathroom. 
5 	
Q. 	
Would you set up the room for the massages? 
6 	
A. 	
Many times. Yes, he will tell me, Set up 
7 the room inside my bathroom or in the bedroom or in 
8 	
Elaine's bathroom, or outside on the balcony. And I 
9 would go and set up or my wife would go and set up the 
10 	
table. 
11 	
We had a table in every room of the house, 
12 	
the massage tables, for the different guests. Because 
13 	
not only he got massages, all the other guests got 
14 	
massages too. So we have a table -- massage table in 
15 	
basically every room, guest room. 
16 	
Q. 	
The girls that would come over to do 
17 massages, they would massage him first or massage guests? 
18 	
A. 	
Different times. There were -- mostly they 
19 was his massage. Mostly he would get massages. 
20 	
Q. 	
Would Ms. Maxwell be in the room with him 
21 while he was getting the massage? 
22 	
A. 	
We don't know. Apparently we saw her going 
23 	
upstairs, because it was -- when they went upstairs, they 
24 	
closed -- his quarters, it had a double door, so it was a 
25 	
door on top of the stairs -- I don't know if you've been

in the house -- and then there's another door going into 
2 	
his room. So it was a long corridor. So everything was 
3 	
closed and nobody saw anything. 
4 	
Q. 	
Would you clean up after? 
5 	
A. 	
Once in a while, yes, I did. Most of the 
6 	
times I did. I did the cleanup. 
7 	
Q. 	
Did it appear as if there was going to be 
8 	
more than one massage going on in the room? 
9 	
A. 	
More than one massage? I don't know. It 
10 was massages. There was massages, because it was a hot 
11 	
oil, and it was -- you know this vibrator, the neck 
12 	
vibrators with the long handles. And towels, a lot of 
13 	
towels. We used a lot of towels in the house. Used like 
14 	
maybe 40, 50 towels a day, because every time he go in 
15 	
into the pool, it was two or three towels. Everything 
16 had to be cleaned up. I went most of the time to pick up 
17 	
the room and get it ready. 
18 	
Q. 	
Did it ever appear to you that more went on 
19 	
in the room other than a massage? 
20 	
A. 	
I just imagine. I never saw anything. But 
21 	
I imagine there was more than 	
I never saw anything 
22 	
because it was closed doors. It was never done outside. 
23 	
Q. 	
Based on the cleanup? 
24 	
A. 	
Based on the cleanup -- at the end, I 
25 	
cannot say there was. At the end, it was a few times

that the bed was undone. You know, we make the beds 
2 three or four times a day. And sometimes we went to 
	
3 	
clean up the massage to put it back, the massage table, 
	
4 	
to pick up the towels, but the bed was undone again. So 
	
5 	
either he took a nap or he went for a nap, I don't know. 
	
6 	
Q. 	
Or something else occurred? 
7 	
A. 	
Or something else. I cannot. 
8 	
Q. 	
Did the girls, would they bring their own 
9 	
stuff or they would use his stuff? 
10 	
A. 	
No. We had everything. We had gallons of 
11 	
stuff, different stuff. 
12 	
Q. 	
Different massage oils? 
1 
13 	
A. 	
Different, all kinds. 
14 	
Q. 	
Different massagers? 
15 	
A. 	
Different stuff. 
16 	
They would buy all over the world different 
17 	
types of -- for different -- 
18 	
Q. 	
Did any of these massagers look like sex 
19 	
toys? 
20 	
A. 	
At the end, at the last year that we were 
21 	
there they had like sex toys, some of them. I can say 
22 maybe three or four occasions that I saw in the sink, 
23 	
they were left out on the sink, and just -- 
24 	
Q. 	
Where would he keep these massagers? 
25 	
A. 	
When I was there, we keep all the stuff in

a basket inside Ms. Maxwell's closet. It was a big 
	
2 	
basket, about this round (indicating), with a cover on 
	
3 	
it. And we used to pick up from the towel and just dump 
	
4 	
it in there. That's it. That's the standard we went 
	
5 	
through. 
	
6 	
Q. 	
What sink would you find those massagers 
7 	
in? 
8 	
A. 	
Mostly in his sink, in his bathroom sink. 
9 	
Q. 	
His bathroom sink? 
10 	
Was Ms. Maxwell still his girlfriend at 
11 	
that time? 
12 	
A. 	
Oh, yeah. 
13 	
Q. 	
Still his girlfriend that you know of right 
14 	
now? 
15 	
A. 	
Yeah. We left, she was still his 
16 	
girlfriend. I don't know now, but she was still there. 
17 	
Q. 	
Why did you leave at the end? 
18 	
A. 	
It was a hard job. It was an incredible 
19 	
hard job. So demanding. Hours were terrible, from 
20 	
5 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night. 
21 	
Constantly on your feet. 
22 	
I got very sick. My health went down the 
23 	
drain. I was diagnosed with cancer, polycythemia, a kind 
24 	
of blood cancer, and we had to leave. It was just too 
25 much for me.

Q. 	
Sounds like a lot. 
2 	
A. 	
Yeah. For me and my wife, we both left. 
3 	
Q. 	
It was very demanding when he was here in 
4 	
town? 
5 	
A. 	
It was terrible. Bad job. Pay was good, 
6 	
but we had enough. 
7 	
Q. 	
I know you guys had a falling out a couple 
8 	
of years ago; I guess you weren't working with him 
9 	
anymore. This would have been in 2003. You guys had a 
10 	
falling out, remember? 
11 	
A. 	
Yeah, we settled that. 
12 	
Q. 	
That was settled? 
13 	
A. 	
That was settled with him between us. 
14 	
Q. 	
Was that -- 
15 	
A. 	
It was an amicable -- it was an agreement, 
16 mutual agreement. It was a mistake on my part. 
17 	
Q. 	
Are there any questions you have of me? 
18 	
A. 	
No. I told you the truth. 
19 	
We just imagined things that could have 
20 	
happened. I used to talk to my wife all day, working and 
21 	
under that environment. But we didn't know for sure what 
22 	
was going on. 
23 	
We never heard anything. We never heard a 
24 	
complaint, or a girl crying. 
25 	
Q. 	
Would these massage girls, especially

towards the end, would they come alone or would they come 
2 	
with other people? 
3 	
A. 	
Mostly they would come alone. It was one 
4 	
girl, one of the young girls, the one I can't think of 
5 	
it, she would bring somebody else. She'd bring other 
6 	
girls. But I didn't even know the names. 
7 	
Q. 	
All of them would go downstairs? 
8 	
A. 	
Yes. 
9 	
Q. 	
Or would one stay downstairs? 
10 	
A. 	
Most of the times when that girl came, it 
11 	
was at night. So after dinner -- after dinner, they went 
12 to the movies. And by the time they went to the movies, 
13 we clean up right away and tried to get out of there. 
14 	
And that was about 8, 9 o'clock at night. 
15 	
After, when they come back, I don't know 
16 what happened. Our quarters were a different -- I don't 
17 	
know if you've been in the house, but our quarters were 
18 	
separate. 
19 	
Q. 	
It's separate. 
20 	
A. 	
Separate. Before -- that building is new. 
21 	
They build the building in 2001. 
22 	
Q. 	
The guest quarters? 
23 	
A. 	
Yeah, the guest quarters. 
24 	
Before, we had an apartment upstairs. 
25 	
Q. 	
They have the laundry and a little office

and the bedroom? 
2 	
A. 	
Yes. That was 2001. Before that, we had 
3 	
an apartment upstairs in their house, in the main house. 
4 	
Q. 	
In the little rooms upstairs across from 
5 	
his master bedroom? 
6 	
A. 	
Right. 
7 	
Q. 	
Was there ever any photographs that you can 
8 	
recall around the house? 
9 	
A. 	
Girls, girls' photographs and guests' 
10 	
photographs, yes. 
11 	
Q. 	
Were they dressed or were they naked? 
12 	
A. 	
Most of them were dressed. It was a lot of 
13 	
entertainment in the pool, around the pool area. But 
14 	
most of them were dressed. 
15 	
Q. 	
When was the last time you spoke with 
16 	
Mr. Epstein? 
17 	
A. 	
The last time I spoke with Mr. Epstein was 
18 	
about a week ago, when you left me the card. I got 
19 	
scared because of that fallout that we had, and I thought 
20 	
it was a consequence of that. And I called and says, 
21 	
Jeffrey, what's going on, what's happening? Because I 
22 	
thought it was an investigation against me on his part. 
23 	
Q. 	
I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. 
24 	
A. 	
That's why I called him. That's the only 
25 	
reason that I called.

Before I even spoke to you. 
2 	
Q. 	
Just when you found the card? 
3 	
A. 	
When I find the card, I get scared. I 
4 	
said, What's going on now? Why are you bothering me now 
5 	
in my house? 
6 	
That's why I called him. 
7 	
He said, John, there is an investigation 
8 	
going on. I have nothing to talk to you. That's it. 
9 	
I said, Okay. 
10 	
Q. 	
He didn't give you any information as to -- 
11 	
A. 	
No, not a word. 
12 	
Q. 	
Has anybody else contacted you from 
13 	
Mr. Epstein or his organization, his assistants, his 
14 	
attorney? 
15 	
A. 	
No, no, no. 
16 	
Q. 	
Anyone that works for his attorney? 
17 	
A. 	
For his attorney? Yes. For his attorney, 
18 the present attorney? Yes. That was an investigator 
19 	
that it was investigated on his side, I can't remember 
20 his name, but I understand it was from Roy Black's 
21 	
office. That was his attorney. And he -- this 
22 	
investigator basically asked me the same questions, 
23 exactly the same questions: What did I know, what did I 
24 	
know. 
25 	
Q 	
When did this happen?

A. 	
This happened about ten days ago -- about a 
2 	
week ago, ten days ago. I'm not sure what date. 
3 	
Q. 	
Was his investigator's name -- 
4 	
A. 	
It's the date after I contacted you. 
5 	
Q. 	
-- Paul, first name Paul? 
6 	
A. 	
Paul, Paul, yes. 
7 	
You have the last name? 
8 	
Q. 	
No. 
9 	
A. 	
He asked me exactly the same questions. 
10 	
Q. 	
Did he offer you any money? 
11 	
A. 	
Absolutely not. I would not take it. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did he tell you not to speak to me? 
13 	
A. 	
No. He says -- no, he told me not to speak 
14 	
to you. He didn't say that to me. He says, It's your 
15 	
choice. You make that decision. 
16 	
And he says, If you hire a lawyer, you make 
17 	
that decision. 
18 	
And we feel that was important for us. I 
19 	
don't want 	
to be involved with this thing. I'm out of 
20 	
the job three years ago, and that's why we hired 
21 	
Mr. Murrell. He suggested that. 
22 	
Q. 	
Did he ask you if anybody else has been 
23 	
contacted? 
24 	
A. 	
No. 
25 	
Q. 	
Did he tell you that to call him back after

our meeting? 
	
2 	
A. 	
No, no. 
3 	
Q. 	
Were you to have any contact with him at 
4 	
any time after our meeting? 
5 	
A. 	
If I will have a contact? I have no reason 
6 	
for it. I have no reason to call Jeffrey or anybody 
7 	
else. This is over, I hope. 
8 	
Q. 	
Well, Mr. Alessi, this is basically an 
9 	
ongoing investigation, so obviously anything that we 
10 	
discuss hopefully will stay between us. Because it is 
11 	
still ongoing, I wouldn't want this out until the 
12 	
investigation is complete. 
13 	
A. 	
It's not going anywhere. Even my kids 
14 	
don't know it. 
15 	
Q. 	
He contacted you after you called 
16 	
Mr. Epstein? 
17 	
A. 	
Yes. 
18 	
When I call him and I said, Jeffrey, what's 
19 	
going on? 
20 	
He said, John, I don't know what's going 
21 	
on. There's an investigation against me. 
22 	
So then I said, Whew, thank God. I don't 
23 	
know what's happening. 
24 	
And then he says, I have an investigator 
25 	
that is investigating, the same thing the police

department is doing. He's going to contact you. 
2 	
And that was the end of it. 
	
3 	
I think his name was Paul. I only met him 
	
4 	
for about fifteen minutes, ten minutes. 
5 	
Q. 	
You met at your house? 
6 	
A. 	
No, no. I don't want him at my house. We 
7 	
met at Carrabas restaurant, but it was not open, so we 
8 	
met outside Carrabas. It took about ten minutes. 
9 	
Q. 	
Going back to the items that were found in 
10 	
the sink, can you describe any of those massagers? 
11 	
A. 	
I only saw two things: It was a big, 
12 	
big 	
I think a vibrator. Big (indicating). And it was 
13 	
a long -- I hate to -- I'm sorry. It was a long dick, I 
14 	
think. Rubber thing. And there was a thing you used it 
15 	
in the back, the vibrator in the back. 
16 	
Q. 	
What color? 
17 	
A. 	
We always had those. Not those toys. 
18 	
Vibrators, we have different types, one for the neck, one 
19 	
for the back. You know the one that has a battery and 
20 	
they move, with balls on it, vibrator. That's it. 
21 	
That's what I find there. I never find anything else. 
22 	
Those two things. 
23 	
Q. 	
Do you remember any names of the girls that 
24 	
might have come over for massages? 
25 	
A. 	
Yes. I remember some of them. From the

Q. 	
As many as you can remember. 
3 	
A. 	
As many as I can remember. 
4 	
Q. 	
I know it's been a while. 
5 	
A. 	
It was Jody. It was Donna. And it was -- 
6 	
it was Virginia. It was -- how many? Virginia, Lana. 
7 	
It was also a young girl, but she was not a 
8 	
massage therapist. She came to the house as a friend, I 
9 	
think. I don't think she was a massage therapist. Her 
10 	
name was -- as a matter of fact, she's in a soap opera 
11 	
now, she's a star. Just give me a minute. 
12 	
Nadya Jorlin, J-0-R-L-I-N. 
13 	
There also were men masseuses. 
14 	
Q. 	
There were men too? 
15 	
A. 	
There were men. A few. Not that many. A 
16 	
few. I can't remember. 
17 	
Allison. There was an Allison. There was 
18 	
a Dina. I think every name -- girls' names. In 
19 	
eleven years, I cannot remember. 
20 	
Q. 	
That's fine. 
21 	
A. 	
There were girls coming and going. There 
22 were girls traveling with him as massage therapists. 
23 They would travel with him all over the world, because he 
24 	
was in the plane, he got massages on the plane, 
25 because -- I know because I used to supply the oils and

the towels for the plane.

Q. 	
Would you clean his plane too?

No, no.

Q. 	
Did you ever travel with him anywhere?

A. 	
No, no. 
6 	
Q. 	
When he went to New York or Arizona or his 
7 	
private island? 
8 	
A. 	
I've been on his island. I've been as a 
9 	
guest, as a vacation. We just took vacations, and I went 
10 to his island in the Caribbean. And I've been in New 
11 	
Mexico. I've been at his house in London. But not as a 
12 	
worker, just vacation. 
13 	
Q. 	
As a vacation? 
14 	
A. 	
Uh-huh. 
15 	
We went to New Mexico for -- it was kind of 
16 a symposium about how to clean homes. It was this lady 
17 	
who make -- teach all the house people, housemen, and 
18 	
they invited us to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to teach us how 
19 	
to clean homes. That was kind of stupid. 
20 	
Q. 	
How he wanted it to be cleaned? 
21 	
A. 	
Yes. We didn't get that much. 
22 	
Q. 	
Can you think of anything that I haven't 
23 asked you that might be relevant to this? 
24 	
A. 	
I can't think of anything. Basically it's 
25 the same questions that the other investigator asked me.

I know it's been a long time. I can't think of stuff I 
6 	
did last week. 
7 	
A. 	
It's been a long time. 
8 	
Q. 	
If by any chance you are contacted again by 
9 his investigator again for any more questions or anything 
10 or any packages that he may deliver to you 
11 	
A. 	
They have to go to Mr. Murrell. 
12 	
Q. 	
I was going to say, have him contact your 
13 	
attorney. 
14 	
MR. MURRELL: Packages? Are we expecting a 
15 	
delivery of something? 
16 	
DET. RECAREY: No. I'm just saying -- 
17 	
MR. MURRELL: Okay. Just making sure there 
18 	
wasn't something I didn't know about. 
19 	
DET. RECAREY: I.e., gifts, et cetera. 
20 	
That kind of thing. 
21 	
THE WITNESS: No. 
22 	
DET. RECAREY: I would appreciate a phone 
23 	
call just to give me a heads up. 
24

Alberto, 
I received your short letter with-great disappointment. Unfortunately, today, I cannot 
accept your "resignation". I'm sorry, but it is not that simple to abandon a "family member", no 
matter how frustrating or good-looking he may be. 
If my appreciation for both you and your talent has not been adequately expressed as you 
and I have not spoken directly, I apologize. 
I am sure you have forgotten, but you had initially assured me that the island project 
would be done for last Christmas. I have always been both gracious and generous in forgiving 
the dates that have slipped by. You and I have,l.thotelt, a unique understanding. 
Jean, who assured me the project would be completely the end of July, when in fact, for 
example, till this day there are still wooden puking crates I or lido tables in the living room, has 
yet to contact me. FuruM4re acme supposed to arrive, but even until today, I have not been told 
what and when to expect the balance. 
Alberto, it is your right to take on only jobs you want. It is both unfair, unfriendly and 
unprofessicittlf to simply leave a job undone in the middle. This is not your way. I don't believe 
that you would treat a less friendly client with the same disregard. 
I would hope that you will reconsider the big house Island project. As you know, we 
have bought many things for the interior and have incurred great expense to get permits and 
drawings in a Moroccan style, but if you choose not to move forward, I think at a minimum, my 
house shotild not be left in the state of disrepair in which it currently sits and should be brought 
to completion as soon as possible. If Jean, who I have great respect for, does not want to 
complete it as I believe he is only an employee and as I have my total relationship not with Jean, 
but with Cabinet Pinto, the obligation falls on you personally. This is only right, you know it is. 
As you are aware, I was told repeatedly that you would call me upon return from your vacation 
and both visit and finish the project. You and I have more of a friendship than my receiving, in a
