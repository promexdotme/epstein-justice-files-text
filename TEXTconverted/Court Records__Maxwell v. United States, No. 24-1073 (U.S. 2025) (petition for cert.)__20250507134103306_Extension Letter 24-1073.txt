          Re:  Ghislaine Maxwell v. United States of America,  
                  S.Ct. No. 24-1073 
 
Dear Mr. Harris: 
 
The petition for a writ of certiorari in the above-captioned case was filed on April 10, 2025, and 
placed on the docket on April 14, 2025. The government’s response is due on May 14, 2025. 
 
We respectfully request, under Rule 30.4 of the rules of this Court, an extension of time to and 
including June 13, 2025, within which to file the government’s response. 
 
This extension is requested to complete preparation of the government’s response, which was 
delayed because of the heavy press of earlier assigned cases to the attorneys handling this matter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D John Sauer 
 
 
 
 
 
Solicitor General
