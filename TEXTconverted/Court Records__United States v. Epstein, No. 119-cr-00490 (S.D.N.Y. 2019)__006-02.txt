UNITED STATES’ SEALED MOTION TO DISMISS 
FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION 
 
The United States hereby requests that this Court enter an order dismissing these 
proceedings and the Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 
3771 (DE 1, the “Petition”), through which Petitioners Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 have 
advanced claims pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.1  This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition because 
                                                 
 
1 See, e.g., Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 571 (2004) 
(“Challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can of course be raised at any time prior to final 
judgment.”); United States v. Giraldo-Prado, 150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir. 1998) (recognizing 
that “a party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pendency of the proceedings”); Harrell 
& Sumner Contracting Co. v. Peabody Petersen Co., 546 F.2d 1227, 1229 (5th Cir. 1977) 
(“[U]nder Rule 12(h)(3), Fed.R.Civ.P., the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be 
raised at any time by motion of a party or otherwise.”); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).  In the 
present motion, the United States seeks dismissal of Petitioners’ claims based on both a legal and 
factual challenge to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction.  This Court may properly consider 
and weigh evidence beyond Petitioners’ allegations when evaluating such a challenge to the 
Court’s subject matter jurisdiction: 
Factual attacks [on a Court’s subject matter jurisdiction] . . . “challenge subject 
matter jurisdiction in fact, irrespective of the pleadings.”  In resolving a factual 
attack, the district court “may consider extrinsic evidence such as testimony and 
affidavits.”  Since such a motion implicates the fundamental question of a trial

Petitioners lack Article III standing and because the claims raised by Petitioners in these 
proceedings are not constitutionally ripe. 
I. 
The Claims Raised in the Petition Must Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject 
 
Matter Jurisdiction Because the Petitioners Lack Standing to Bring Those Claims. 
 
These proceedings pursuant to the CVRA must be dismissed for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction because Petitioners lack standing to pursue the remedies that they are seeking for 
alleged CVRA violations.  As the Supreme Court has explained, 
to satisfy Article III’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has 
suffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or 
imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the 
challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely 
speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. 
 
Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 
(2000); see also, e.g., Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 F.3d 1027, 1038 (11th Cir. 
2008) (quoting Harris v. Evans, 20 F.3d 1118, 1121 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc)).  Moreover, “a 
plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.”  Friends of the 
Earth, 528 U.S. at 185. 
 
Here, the record incontrovertibly demonstrates that Petitioners cannot satisfy the third 
prong of the standing test, and the Petition and these proceedings must accordingly be dismissed 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.2  E.g., Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc. v. South Florida 
                                                                                                                                                             
court’s jurisdiction, a “trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as 
to the existence of its power to hear the case” without presuming the truthfulness 
of the plaintiff’s allegations. 
Makro Capital of America, Inc. v. UBS AG, 543 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations 
omitted); see also, e.g., McMaster v. United States, 177 F.3d 936, 940 (11th Cir. 1999) (“[W]e 
determine whether this lawsuit survives the government’s factual attack [on subject matter 
jurisdiction] by looking to matters outside the pleadings, and we do not accord any presumptive 
truthfulness to the allegations in the complaint.”); Scarfo v. Ginsberg, 175 F.3d 957, 960-61 
(11th Cir. 1999). 
 
2 Although Petitioners also fail to satisfy the first and second prongs of the standing test,

Water Management Dist., 647 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011) (“If at any point in the litigation 
the plaintiff ceases to meet all three requirements for constitutional standing, the case no longer 
presents a live case or controversy, and the federal court must dismiss the case for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.”); Phoenix of Broward, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., 489 F.3d 1156, 1161 (11th 
Cir. 2007) (“[T]he issue of constitutional standing is jurisdictional . . . .”); National Parks 
Conservation Ass’n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1242 (11th Cir. 2003) (“[B]ecause the 
constitutional standing doctrine stems directly from Article III’s ‘case or controversy’ 
requirement, this issue implicates our subject matter jurisdiction, and accordingly must be 
addressed as a threshold matter regardless of whether it is raised by the parties.”) (citation 
omitted). 
 
In these proceedings, the only identified legal relief that Petitioners have sought pursuant 
to the CVRA is the setting aside of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that was entered into 
between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida 
(“USAO-SDFL”).  See, e.g., DE 99 at 6 (recognizing that the relief Petitioners seek “is to 
invalidate the non-prosecution agreement”).  But even assuming arguendo that Petitioners’ rights 
under the CVRA were violated when Epstein and the USAO-SDFL entered into the Non-
Prosecution Agreement, constitutional due process guarantees do not allow either the Non-
Prosecution Agreement – which by its terms induced Epstein to, inter alia, plead guilty to state 
criminal charges and serve an 18-month sentence of state incarceration3 – or the governmental 
                                                                                                                                                             
this Court need not reach or address those issues because an analysis of the third prong of the 
standing test incontrovertibly establishes the Petitioners’ lack of standing.  Nonetheless, the 
circumstances which demonstrate Petitioners’ lack of a concrete injury traceable to government 
conduct are explored infra in Section II of this memorandum, which addresses how Petitioners’ 
claims and these proceedings lack constitutional ripeness. 
 
3 See also July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 20-21 (Petitioners’ acknowledgement that Epstein’s 
reliance on promises in Non-Prosecution Agreement led to his guilty plea to state charges and his

obligations undertaken therein to be set aside.4  See, e.g., Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 
262 (1971) (“[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the 
prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise 
must be fulfilled.”); United States v. Harvey, 869 F.2d 1439, 1443 (11th Cir. 1989) (“Due 
process requires the government to adhere to the terms of any plea bargain or immunity 
agreement it makes.”).  Indeed, even if this Court were somehow to set aside the Non-
Prosecution Agreement on the authority of the CVRA, and even if after consultation with 
Petitioners the United States determined that it would be proper and desirable to institute a 
criminal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida against Epstein on the criminal charges 
contemplated in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the United States would still be 
constitutionally required to adhere to the negotiated terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.  
See, e.g., Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262; Harvey, 869 F.2d at 1443. 
 
Due process considerations further bar this Court from setting aside a non-prosecution 
agreement that grants contractual rights to a contracting party (Epstein) who has not been made a 
party to the proceedings before the Court.  See, e.g., School Dist. of City of Pontiac v. Secretary 
of U.S. Dept. of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 303 (6th Cir. 2009) (“It is hornbook law that all parties to a 
contract are necessary in an action challenging its validity . . . .”); Dawavendewa v. Salt River 
Project Agr. Imp. & Power Dist., 276 F.3d 1150, 1157 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[A] party to a contract is 
necessary, and if not susceptible to joinder, indispensable to litigation seeking to decimate that 
                                                                                                                                                             
subsequent 18-month state incarceration). 
 
4 To the extent that the Petitioners’ requested invalidation of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement would implicitly reject and nullify the correctness of both the state court’s acceptance 
of Epstein’s guilty plea and the resulting judgment of conviction –which were induced in part by 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement – such judicial action might raise additional questions about this 
Court’s jurisdiction under the Rooker/Feldman doctrine.  See, e.g., Casale v. Tillman, 558 F.3d 
1258, 1260-61 (11th Cir. 2009); Powell v. Powell, 80 F.3d 464, 466-68 (11th Cir. 1996).

contract.”); Lomayaktewa v. Hathaway, 520 F.2d 1324, 1325 (9th Cir. 1975) (“No procedural 
principle is more deeply imbedded in the common law than that, in an action to set aside a lease 
or a contract, all parties who may be affected by the determination of the action are 
indispensable.”); see also National Licorice Co. v. NLRB, 309 U.S. 350, 362 (1940) (“It is 
elementary that it is not within the power of any tribunal to make a binding adjudication of the 
rights in personam of parties not brought before it by due process of law.”).5 
 
Additionally, a “favorable ruling” from this Court will not provide Petitioners with 
anything for the alleged CVRA violations that is not already available to them.  For the due 
process reasons already discussed above, the United States must legally abide by the terms of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement even if this Court should somehow set the agreement aside for 
Petitioners to consult further with the government attorney handling the case.  Moreover, as will 
be explained in greater detail below, see infra at 8-12, Petitioners already have the present ability 
to confer with an attorney for the government about a federal criminal case against Epstein – 
whether or not the Non-Prosecution Agreement is set aside – because the investigation and 
potential federal prosecution of Epstein for crimes committed against the Petitioners and others 
remains a legally viable possibility.6 
 
The present proceedings under the CVRA must accordingly be dismissed for lack of 
standing because Petitioners simply have no injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable 
ruling in these proceedings.  See, e.g., Scott v. Taylor, 470 F.3d 1014, 1018 (11th Cir. 2006) 
(holding that there was no standing where it was speculative that remedy that Plaintiff sought 
                                                 
 
5 Significantly, it is Epstein’s contractual rights under the non-prosecution agreement that 
Petitioners seek to void through these proceedings. 
 
6 Petitioners’ present, as well as past, ability to confer with an attorney for the government 
also demonstrates that Petitioners fail to satisfy the first two prongs of the standing test: 
Petitioners have simply not suffered a concrete injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged 
government conduct.

would redress claimed injury). 
II. 
The Claims Raised in the Petition Are Not Constitutionally Ripe, and These 
 
Proceedings Must Thus Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. 
 
 
This Court must also dismiss these proceedings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
because the Petitioners’ claims are not constitutionally ripe. 
 
Ripeness, like standing, “originate[s] from the Constitution’s Article III requirement that 
the jurisdiction of the federal courts be limited to actual cases and controversies.”  Elend v. 
Basham, 471 F.3d 1199, 1204-05 (11th Cir. 2006).   “‘The ripeness doctrine keeps federal courts 
from deciding cases prematurely,’ Beaulieu v. City of Alabaster, 454 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir. 
2006), and ‘protects [them] from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the 
review of potential or abstract disputes,’ Digital Props., Inc. v. City of Plantation, 121 F.3d 586, 
589 (11th Cir.1997).”  United States v. Rivera, 613 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir. 2010); see also 
Pittman v. Cole, 267 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001) (“‘The ripeness doctrine prevent[s] the 
courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements . . . .’”) (quoting Coalition for the Abolition of Marijuana Prohibition v. City of 
Atlanta, 219 F.3d 1301, 1315 (11th Cir. 2000) (citations and quotations omitted))).  Under the 
ripeness doctrine, a court must therefore determine “‘whether there is sufficient injury to meet 
Article III’s requirement of a case or controversy and, if so, whether the claim is sufficiently 
mature, and the issues sufficiently defined and concrete, to permit effective decisionmaking by 
the court.’”  In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cheffer v. Reno, 55 F.3d 
1517, 1524 (11th Cir. 1995)). 
 
When evaluating whether a claim is ripe, a court considers: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues 
for judicial decision, and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’” Id. 
(quoting Cheffer, 55 F.3d at 1524 (citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)));

see also, e.g., Association For Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. v. Conger, 899 F.2d 
1164, 1165 (11th Cir. 1990).  Under the doctrine, “[a] claim is not ripe when it is based on 
speculative possibilities,” In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011), such as if the claim 
“‘rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur 
at all,’” Atlanta Gas Light Co. v. FERC, 140 F.3d 1392, 1404 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Texas v. 
United States, 523U.S. 296, 300 (1998)).  Indeed, “[t]he ripeness doctrine is designed to prevent 
federal courts from engaging in such speculation and prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily 
reaching constitutional issues.”  Pittman, 267 F.3d at 1280. 
 
In these proceedings, the Petitioners have sought to set aside the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL so that Petitioners can “confer with the 
attorney for the Government” about the possible filing of federal criminal charges against 
Epstein and the potential disposition of any such charges.  See, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 6-7 
(seeking an “[o]rder that the [non-prosecution] agreement that was negotiated is invalid” so that 
Petitioners can exercise the right to confer with the government); id. at 19-20, 24; 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3771(a)(5); see also DE 1 at 2 ¶ 5 (claiming that Petitioner was “denied her rights” under the 
CVRA because she “received no consultation with the attorney for the government regarding the 
possible disposition of the charges”). 
 
Notwithstanding the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Petitioners are and have been free to 
confer with attorneys for the government about the investigation and potential prosecution of 
Epstein.  At least one attorney for the government (Assistant United States Attorney Villafaña 
from the USAO-SDFL) had spoken to Petitioners about the offenses committed against them by 
Epstein prior to the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, see, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. 
at 22 (acknowledging that prosecutors spoke to Petitioners “about what happened” to them); DE 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 8 of 20
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6-2     Filed 07/11/19     Page 8 of 15

48 at 6 ¶ 8; see also DE 99 at 3, and government attorneys have on multiple occasions offered to 
confer with Petitioners, see, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 13 (“I will always confer, sit down 
with Jane Doe 1 and 2, with the two agents and Ms. Villafana.  We’ll be happy to sit down with 
them.”).  Indeed, on December 10, 2010, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, accompanied by supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL, personally 
conferred with Petitioners’ counsel and with Petitioner Jane Doe #1 and entertained discussion 
about Petitioners’ desires to see Epstein criminally prosecuted on federal charges.7  The United 
States Attorney and prosecutors in the USAO-SDFL have also corresponded with Petitioners’ 
counsel on multiple occasions about Petitioners’ desires to have Epstein criminally prosecuted on 
federal charges.8 
 
Additionally,
a number of districts outside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern 
District of New York and the District of New Jersey) share jurisdiction and venue with the 
Southern District of Florida over potential federal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual 
acts committed by Epstein against the Petitioners.  Epstein is thus subject to potential 
prosecution for such acts in those districts.  Furthermore, because of the nature of the allegations 
against Epstein, the filing of such potential charges against Epstein still remains temporally 
viable; charges for such sexual activities involving minors are not barred by the applicable 
                                                 
 
7 The United States Attorney also offered to confer with Jane Doe #2, but Jane Doe #2 
declined the invitation and did not attend the meeting that was scheduled with the United States 
Attorney. 
 
8 Since that time, the USAO-SDFL has been recused by the Department of Justice from 
prospective responsibility for any criminal investigation or potential prosecution relating to 
Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with minor females.  The Department of Justice has reassigned 
responsibility for the investigation and potential prosecution of such criminal matters in the 
Southern District of Florida to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of 
Florida for consideration of any prosecutorial action that may be authorized and appropriate.

statutes of limitations.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3283, 3299.  Petitioners are free to contact the United 
States Attorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government attorneys in those 
offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged federal 
crimes committed against them.9 
 
Petitioners nonetheless have appeared to contend throughout these proceedings that the 
many opportunities that they have been given to consult with the attorneys for the government 
about Epstein’s offenses and the potential charges against Epstein – opportunities which continue 
to be available to Petitioners – are not meaningful under the CVRA due to the existence of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement.  According to Petitioners, the Non-Prosecution Agreement has 
given Epstein a “free pass” on federal criminal charges for the offenses he committed against 
Petitioners and others.  See, e.g., DE 9 at 15 (characterizing Non-Prosecution Agreement as “a 
‘free pass’ from the federal government”), 2 (contending that the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
“allowed [Epstein] . . . to escape all federal prosecution for dozens of serious federal sex offenses 
against minors”), 7 (“the wealthy defendant has escaped all federal punishment”), 12 (“[T]he 
agreement prevents federal prosecution of the defendant for numerous sex offenses.”); DE 77 at 
2 (describing Non-Prosecution Agreement as “an agreement that blocked federal prosecution of 
Epstein for the multitude of sex offenses he committed again [sic] the victims”), 17 (“The [Non-
                                                 
 
9 The USAO-SDFL has no present knowledge about whether the United States Attorney’s 
Offices in those districts have opened any investigations into the allegations that have been made 
against Epstein, whether those offices are even aware of those allegations or the evidence 
supporting them, or what investigative or prosecutorial actions, if any, those offices might take in 
the future.  Nonetheless, should any investigation be underway or should any investigation be 
initiated involving such allegations, the evidence gathered
in the Southern 
District of Florida could be disclosed to federal prosecutors and federal grand juries in New York 
or New Jersey.  See 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 10 of

Prosecution Agreement] barred prosecution of the federal sexual offenses that Epstein had 
committed against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 . . . .”).10  That is simply not so. 
 
Contrary to Petitioners’ contentions, there has been no disposition by the government of 
any federal criminal charges against Epstein.  No federal charges involving Petitioners have ever 
been brought against Epstein, and no such federal charges have been resolved.  The Non-
Prosecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal 
charges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal 
criminal charges against Epstein.  Instead, when addressing potential federal criminal charges 
against Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely agreed in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that: 
on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred 
in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the 
following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth below. 
 
and that 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no 
prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement, nor any 
other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses 
that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this 
District, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed. 
 
Non-Prosecution Agreement at 2 (emphasis added). 
 
Thus, the Non-Prosecution Agreement simply obligated the government not to prosecute 
Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution 
                                                 
 
10 This Court has also previously described the Non-Prosecution Agreement as “an 
agreement under which . . . the U.S. Attorney’s Office would agree not to prosecute Epstein for 
federal offenses.”  DE 99 at 2-3.  That description of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, however, 
was not based on the Court’s interpretation of the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, but 
was instead based on “allegations” by Petitioners that the Court concluded were “not yet 
supported by evidence” but upon which the Court nonetheless relied “solely to provide the 
context for the threshold issues addressed in” its September 26, 2011 Order.  Id. at 2 n.2.

Agreement.  The Non-Prosecution Agreement does not bar the United States from bringing 
federal criminal charges against Epstein for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement in any other district in the nation.11  See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 587 F.2d 678, 
680 (5th Cir. 1979) (“Where . . . the prosecutor is not found to have made promises relating to 
nonprosecution of charges in another district and the [defendant] is not found to have relied on 
such alleged promises, this Court will affirm the trial court’s denial of a motion to dismiss the 
subsequent prosecutions.”).  Neither does the Non-Prosecution Agreement bar prosecution in any 
district for offenses not identified in the agreement. 
 
Petitioners contend that the CVRA gives a victim the right to confer with the attorney for 
the government before there is a disposition of contemplated, but-not-yet-filed federal criminal 
charges arising from offenses against the victim.  But, although the government disputes that the 
CVRA creates such a right,12 the Petitioners have never been denied any such right.  The 
Petitioners have had and still have the ability confer to with the attorney for the government 
about potential federal criminal charges against Epstein and about the potential disposition of 
any such charges, should they be filed.  In fact, Petitioners are free to approach the United States 
Attorney’s Offices in districts such as the Southern District of New York and the District of New 
Jersey – whose authority to institute criminal charges against Epstein in their districts has not 
                                                 
 
11 Significantly, under the governing provision of the United States Attorney’s Manual, the 
USAO-SDFL did not have the authority to unilaterally bar Epstein’s prosecution in any other 
district in the country: 
 
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any agreement not to 
prosecute, which purports to bind any other district(s) or division without the 
express written approval of the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district 
and/or the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division. 
 
USAM 9-27.641 (Multi-District (Global) Agreement Requests). 
 
12 The government acknowledges that this Court has nonetheless ruled that “as a matter of 
law the CVRA can apply before formal charges are filed,” DE 99 at 10; see also id. at 6-9, but 
has not yet determined “whether the particular rights asserted here attached,” id. at 10.

been curtailed by the Non-Prosecution Agreement – to discuss the possibility of pursuing federal 
criminal charges against Epstein.13  Nothing precludes Petitioners from doing so, and there is 
nothing to indicate that Petitioners’ wishes to confer with government attorneys in those districts 
would be rebuffed in any way.  Indeed, it would be rank speculation by Petitioners to contend 
otherwise. 
 
Here, Petitioners have acknowledged that the best relief they can hope to obtain through 
these proceedings is the ability to confer with the attorneys for the government.  See, e.g., July 
11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 7 (agreeing that “the best [Petitioners] can get” is the “right to confer”).  
Yet, under the circumstances, a claim that Petitioners have been denied the opportunity to confer 
with the attorney for the government about the filing and disposition of criminal charges against 
Epstein is premature and constitutionally unripe.  “This is plainly the type of hypothetical case 
that [a court] should avoid deciding.”  Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. 
v. Conger, 899 F.2d 1164, 1166 (11th Cir. 1990).  Any speculation by Petitioners that they might 
prospectively be denied the opportunity to confer with the government about still-legally-viable 
federal charges against Epstein simply cannot ripen Petitioners’ claims.  See id. (recognizing that 
courts “do not generally decide cases based on a party’s predicted conduct”). 
 
For these reasons, Petitioners’ claims in these proceedings should be dismissed for lack 
of subject matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011) 
(holding that claims that are “based on events that may take place in the future” are to be 
“dismissed for lack of jurisdiction”) (citing Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 F.2d 1570, 
1574 n.7 (11th Cir. 1989) (“[R]ipeness goes to whether the district court had subject matter 
                                                 
 
13 Petitioners could also approach the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle 
District of Florida, but, due to that office’s recusal-based derivative prosecutorial responsibilities 
in the Southern District of Florida, see supra note 8, the Non-Prosecution Agreement would 
constrain the possible filing of federal charges by that office in the Southern District of Florida.

jurisdiction to hear the case.”)); Reahard v. Lee County, 30 F.3d 1412, 1415 (11th Cir. 1994) 
(“The question of ripeness ‘goes to whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.’”) 
(quoting Greenbriar, 881 F.2d at 1573); see also Jacksonville Property Rights Ass’n, Inc. v. City 
of Jacksonville, 635 F.3d 1266, 1276 (11th Cir. 2011) (concluding that when plaintiffs ask a 
court “to issue a declaration on an issue that might never impact their substantive rights,” they 
are “asking th[e] court either to issue an impermissible advisory opinion, or to decide a case that 
is not yet ripe for decision”), reh’g & reh’g en banc denied, Case No. 09-15629, __ Fed. App’x 
__ (11th Cir. Jun. 29, 2011) (Table). 
Conclusion 
 
For the reasons set forth above, the United States respectfully requests that this Court 
enter an order dismissing the Petitioners’ claims and these proceedings for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction.
