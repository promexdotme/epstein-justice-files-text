Proceedings

THE COURT: 
Last nama is apallad? 
MR. 
EDWARDS: 
Edwards. E-D-W-A-R-D-S. 
THE COURT: 
Okay, 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
For the other side, Your Honor, 
Jack Goldberger along with Robert Critton on behalf of 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
THE COURT: 
It is the POSt'S and 
Motion to 
Intervene for the purpose of unsealing records?· 
MR. 
BERGER: 
Yes, sir. 
THE COURT: 
Hera's what I 
think I 
know, and I tell 
you this so that you can fill in the gaps of what you know 
that I don"t know and suggest what you think I ought to 
do. It appears to me tbat there was some agreement --
an 
agreement that was sealed and then an addendum or 
amendment to the agreement that was sealed as to documents 
in the court's tiles under seal and it appears as though 
the punitive intervener& want to unseal those and take a 
peak at them. 
I don't see where any of the proper 
procadura& to seal the· documents was aver followed to 
begin with. I don't know but it's not jumping out at ffle 
when I reviewed the file. So, I'm thinking that it might 
be appropriate and the burden might be on the moving 
party, being the State and Mr. Epstein, to give them the 
opportunity to jump through the hur --
hoops to seal the 
documents if they are entitled to have them sealed, then

I'll grant that request. If they're not entitled to seal 
then I'll order it as documents unsealed. But that's kind 
of procedurally where I think the case is. I will allow 
Mr. Berger and Ms. Shullmao to argue if they wish to, 
otherwise I will go over to Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton 
to perhaps talk about what they think about my suggestion. 
Mr. Berger? 
MR. 
BERGER: 
I -- I'd like to hear what they say. 
THE COURT: 
Ms. Shullman? 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Agreed. 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Goldberger? 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor 
THE COURT: 
I mean, it ·1ooks like they just handed 
up an Agreed Order to sign. 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
Well, if the Court 
I know the 
Court is trying to short circuit here and the idea in 
theory is not horrible, it's not terrible, it's actually 
not so bad. But let me alert the Court to a couple of 
issues. First of all, this iS not something that came up 
ahead of time where we ware moving to close a hearing or 
file documents under seal and the Rules of Judicial 
Administration makes an important distinction between 
things that are done in advance and things that come up 
during a hearing and the fact that maybe it goaa to the 
Rule -- talk about situations that arise during the course

of a hearing, that the Rules would not apply to that. 
secondly,
■■■■ Motion to Intervene is brought under a 
Rule that does not apply because she brought it under a 
Rule that applies to non-criminal cases. Having said that 
I know the Court's desire to get to the issues here and I 
just need to alert the Court to one other matter because I 
think it's really important. The PlaintiCt•s, -• has 
this agreement already. They have this agreement. counsel 
will tell you they have this agreement. There have been 
two hearings in front of Judge Marra who bas the Federal 
cases here. They moved to unseal the non-prosecution 
agreement in front of Judge Marra. He entered an initial 
Order, a very, very well reasoned Order which I have a 
copy for the court. 
THB COURT: 
Oh, thanks. 
MR. 
GOLDBERGBR: 
He entered a very, very well 
reasoned Order weighing the interest of the Plaintiffs to 
have access to the non~prosacution agreement with the 
confidentiality that the parties inrended to be part of 
this agreement. And what he did, he said they can have 
this agreement. They can review it all they want. If they 
want to review it with somebody else, they need to give 
them a copy of this Order that it is not to be disclosed 
to anyone else. subsequent to that 
so that's the Rule 
that's in place right now. Subsequent to that the

Plaintiffs went back and said we want to disseminate this 
Order. we want to disseminate this agreement to other 
parties and Judge Marra entered a second Order denying 
that request and said, no. My Order is in place but if you 
have some compelling reason why you want this agreement to 
be diaseminated to others, file a motion and come back to 
me. 
THB COURT: 
This is as a result of some civil 
litigation pending in the Federal Courthouse? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes. 
THB COURT: 
going on1 
As opposed to any criminal prosecution 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
It is civil proceedings that are 
going on in Federal court. But in the interest of comedy, 
Your Honor, the Court has ruled on the confidentiality 
agreement and has put a well reasoned procmdure into 
place. It the parties want that agreement unsealed where 
they need to go is go back to Federal Court and Judge 
Marra invited them to do so. 
THE COURT1 
That may be as it pertains to_, but 
what about The Post? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I think --
and I think I know where 
the Court is going on this. If The Post's position is the 
public has right to ace -- access to this then there is a 
procedure in place and ultimately the court has to ccnduct

a hearing and do the balancing test where you look at 
whether there 1s some compelling government interest and 
that's going to require an evidentiary hearing. so I have 
no great objection to filing tha Request for Closure and 
then have a hearing in front of the Court. 
THE COURT: 
Well, let's do 
I'm thinking out loud. 
I'm not ruling. I will give you all a chance to argue 
further, but this is what I'm thinking I will do, grant 
the Motion to Intervene. It gives standing to -
It 
gives standing to The Post to contest the tact that these 
were sealed. And then I will shift the burden back on the 
State and Defendant, Mr. Epstein, to petition the Court to 
seal these documents. Until such time that I rule on that 
I will leave them under seal because they might have been 
correctly sealed but the procedure wasn't followed. 
There's got to be notice. You've got to comply with the 
Administrative order 2.303. You've got to comply with the 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(dl. I think even 
though that•~ a civil -- it addresse• a civil matter this 
is, you know, in the nature of a civil procedure. So, I'll 
do that. And thank you for these Orders. so, where do we 
go from here? I'm thinking out loud, not r~ling. Mr. 
Berger?

I think the Court needs to deal with this 
immediately, expaditiously. Thia is a matter that the 
Supreme Court has placed incredible scrutiny over. And the 
Rule that we are traveling under -- we're not only 
traveling under a Rule of Judicial Administration that 
applies to criminal and civil cases, we're applying to an 
Administrative Order of this Court that was in place when 
the sealing was done and that superseded the sealing. 
THE COURT;

MR. 
BERGER: 
I'm just saying, I respectfully request 
that the Court not delay this one minute.

You've got the agreements anyway. You've

MR. 
BERGER: 
Judge, we cannot do anything with them. 
THE COURT: 
Take that up with Judge Marra. 
MR. 
BERGER: 
No, air. That is not what tha Order 
says. May I quote Judge Marra. "If a specific tangible 
need arises in a civil case the relief should be sought in 
that case. 
In other words, the civil cases which are in 
front of Judge Hafele is one forum that Judge Marra said 
go to it. Judge Marra did not say that this Court does not 
have jurisdiction to unseal its own sealed records or to 
vacate its own Order sealing. And any characterization is 
is false. 
THE COURT: 
I'll take a look at it and I'll draw

MS.

here essentially, I would agree

with Mr. Berger that we need an immediate hearing on this 
issue. That's what we're here to do today. I think I heard 
Your Honor say 
were applied. 
that he's not clear that the procedures 
My review of the record does not reveal that 
the procedures were complied with. My review is similar to 
Your Honor's. It looks like sort of everybody approached 
the bench and Judge Pucillo said let's take it under seal. 
If Mr. Epstein's counsel is not prepared to go forward 
today and meet hie burden, then I would ask that this 
Court set a hearing as soon as practical because the right 
solution here should be to unseal the records and then,

process and let's get this back on my docket as quickly as 
possible and give them until Friday to tile their notice 
and tan days after that we have an evidentiary hearing. I 
go through the procesa then. What bad thing ia going to 
happen by waiting theae extra twelve to fifteen days? 
MS. 
SHULLMAN: 
The bad thing that's going to happen, 
Your Honor, is that the status quo in Florida is that the 
constitutional right of access is openness. 
THE COURT: 
Right. 
MS. 
SHULLMAN: 
You know, certainly if Your Honor is 
inclined to postpone this hearing I would ask that it be 
done expeditiously as you suggest. 
THE COURT: 
Yeah. 
MS. 
SHULLMAN: 
You know, Friday and then ten days 
thereafter, it just delays access for another two weeks 
and it infringes on our rights. 
THE COURT: 
I agree. Mr. Berger, I will let you 
answer that aame question. 
MR. 
BERGER: 
THE COURT: 
MR. 
BERGER: 
THE COURT: 
I don't think --
Anything specific rather than --
Yes. 
You know, anything closed that the 
people are allowed to look at is a transgression and any 
transgression is bad, but anything unique beyond that? 
MR. 
BERGER: 
Your Honor --
Your Honor, 
I

believe that this Court has the jurisdiction to revisit 
the propriety of the sealing of these records and give the 
Defendant or the State, for that matter, a second bite at 
the apple, If the records are sealed improperly, which the 
Court hae said on its face that appears to have occurred, 
I do not believe that this Court has jurisdiction to allow 
them a second bite at the apple to go through with the 
notice requirements. They should have done that in front 
of Judge Pucillo a year ago and they did not do it. The 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 simply does not give 
this Court the right to reactivate the procedure that you 
outlined. 
THE COURT: 
Okay, 
MR. 
BERC3ER: 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: 
Anything further, Mr. Goldberger or Mr. 
Critton? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Just note, Your Honor, as far as 
the timing of this and we want to do this expeditiously, 
of course, this sealing occurred not last week, not two 
weeks ago, not four months ago but eleven and 
months ago. The Post reported this last July. 
one half 
so, 
I 
understand the right for the pubic to have access and we 
want to do this as quickly as possible but there is no 
fire here. There is no house burning. 
THE COURT: 
Then I'll go ahead and enter an Order as

I've indicated, that is that I'll grant the Intervener's 
Motion to Intervene. You have standing. 1 will order that 
the Stat• and/or the defense by noon Friday file a Notice 
of --
comply with the Administrative Order 2.)03 and the 
Judicial Rule --
the Rule of Judicial Administration 
14 
2.420, paragraph d, that outline ■ the procadures to seal 
tiles in these types of cases and then we•ll get a hearing 
scheduled for argument on whether or not they will be 
sealed. Until that time they will remain sealed because 
Judge Pucillo signed off on the Order and I'm not inclined 
to disturb that until I find more about the merits of the 
movant•s position. 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: 
Anybody want to reduce any of that mess 
to a written Order? 
MR. 
EDWARDS: 
I'd like to Your Honor. I'd like to 
know if you're going to give us a hearing date today. 
THE COURT: 
I'll deal with that. Yeah. Let me give 
you some time. How much time do you think it's going to 
take? I don't think I'm going to have any surprises. How 
much time do you think we need? A half hour? 
MR. 
EDWARDS: 
lon.gest. 
THE COURT: 
Not more. I'd say an hour at the 
I'm not taking evidence or anything like 
that. In the meantime, do you agree it would be Prudent

for me to take a look and see what the content of these 
things are so I can be articulate on what 
about? I didn't do that for today's hearing? 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
The defense --
their know 
MR. 
EDWARDS: 
The non-prosecution agre~ment? 
THE COURT: 
Right. Whatever is under seal. Whatever 
it is that's under seal I'll take a look at it so that I 
can at least have a !eel tor apparently what you all know 
and I don't. 
HR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
The defense has no objection. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. I'll go ahead and read those two 
15 
sealed documents and I' 11 see you back here, assuming that 
Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton get that done between now 
and Friday. Ten days from this Friday is the 22nd. How 
about we do this on the 25th at 1:307

MR. GOLDBERGER: For the other side, Your Honor, Jack Goldberger along with 
Robert Critton on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein. 
TIIE COURT: It is the Post's and -
Motion to Intervene for the purpose of 
unsealing records? 
MR. BERGER: Yes, sir. 
TI-IE COURT: Here's what I think I know, and I tell you this so that you can fill in 
the gaps of what you know that I don't know and suggest what you think I ought to do. It 
appears to me that there was some agreement -- an agreement that was sealed and then an 
addendum or amendment to the agreement that was sealed as to documents in the Court's files 
under seal and it appears as though the pWlitive interveners want to unseal those and take a 
peak at them. I don"t see where any of the proper procedures t.o seal the documents was ever 
followed to begin with. I don't know but it•s not jumping out at me when I reviewed the 
file. So, I'm thinking that it might be appropriate and the burden might be on the moving 
party, being the State and Mr. Epstein, to give them the opportWlity to jump through the bur 
hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled to have them sealed, then

of a hearing, that the Rules would not apply to that. Secondly, -Motion to Intervene 
1s brought under a Rule that does not apply because she brought it under a Rule that 
applies to non-criminal cases. Having said that I know the Court's desire to get to the 
issues here and I just need to alert the Court to one other matter because I think its 
really important. The Plaintiff's, -
has this agreement already. They have this 
agreement. Counsel will tell you they have this agreement. There have been two hearings in 
front of Judge Marra who has the Federal cases here. They moved to unseal the non-
prosecution agreement in front of Judge Marra. He entered an initial Order, a very, very 
well reasoned order which I have a copy for the Court. 
TI-IE COURT: Oh, thanks. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: He entered a very, very well reasoned order weighing the

confidentiality that the parties intended to be part of this agreement. And what he did, 
he said they can have this agreement. They can review it all they want. If they want to 
review it with somebody else, they need. to give them a copy of this Order that it is not 
to be disclosed to anyone else. Subsequent to that -- so that's the Rule that's in place 
right now. Subsequent to that the

Plaintiffs went back and said we want to disseminate this Order. we want to disseminate 
this agreement to other parties and Judge Marra entered a second Order denying that request 
and said, no. My Order is in place but if you have some compelling reason why you want this 
agreement to be disseminated to others, file a motion and come back to 
THE COURT: This is as a result of some civil litigation pending in the 
Federal Courthouse? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes. 
TiiE COURT: As opposed to any criminal prosecution going on? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: It is civil proceedings that are going on in Federal court. But 
in the interest of comedy, Your Honor, the Court has ruled on the confidentiality 
agreement and has put a well reasoned procedure into place. If the parties want that 
agreement unsealed where they need to go is go back to Federal Court and Judge Marra 
invited them to do so. 
THE COURT: That may be as it pertains to .... but what about The Post? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: I think 
and I think I know where the court is going on this. If 
The Post's position is the public has right to ace -- access to this then there is a 
procedure in place and ultimately the Court has to conduct

a hearing and do the balancing test where you look at whether there is some compelling 
government interest and that's going to require an evidentiary hearing. So I have no great 
objection to filing the Request tor Closure and then have a hearing in front of the court. 
THE COURT: well, let's do~- I•m thinking out loud. I'm not ruling. I will give 
you all a chance to argue further, but this is what I"m thinking I will do, grant the 
~tion to Intervene. It gives standing to,. It gives standing to The Post to contest the 
fact that these were sealed. And then I will shift the burden back on the State and 
Defendant, Mr. Epstein, to petition the Court to seal these documents. Until such time that 
I rule on that I will leave them under seal because they might have been correctly sealed 
but the procedure wasn't followed. There's got to be notice. You"ve got to comply with the 
Administrative order 2.303. You"ve got to comply with the Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420{d). I think even though that's a civil -- it addresses a civil matter this is, you 
know, in the nature of a civil procedure. so, I'll do that. And thank you for these orders.

believe that this Court has the jurisdiction to revisit the propriety of the sealing of 
these records and give the Defendant or the State, for that matter, a second bite at the 
apple. If the records are aealed improperly, which the court has said on its face that 
appcillar ■ to have occurred, I do not believe that this Court has jurisdiction to allow them a 
second bite at the apple to go through with the notice requirements. They should have done 
that in front of Judge Pucillo a year ago and they did not do it. The Rule of Judicial 
Administration 2 420 simply does not give this Court the right to reactivate the procedure

IN THE CIRCUIT OCURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT 
IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2.303-9/08 
IN RE: SEALING OF COURT HEARINGS 
AND RECORDS 
The Florida constitution mandates that the public shall have access to court records, subject 
only to certain enumerated limitations which are restricted by operation of state law, federal law, or 
court rule. In re Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Admin. 2.420- Sealing of Court Records, 
954 So.2d 16 (Fla. 2007). The Rules of the Supreme Court strongly disfavor court records that are 
hidden from public scrutiny. The Florida Supreme Court recently adopted Interim Rule 2.420 of the 
Florida Rules of Judicial Administration which addresses the procedures for sealing noncriminal 
court records. In order to ensure that both criminal and noncriminal court records are sealed properly 
it is 
NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority conferred by Florida Rule of Judicial 
Administration 2.215, it is ORDERED as follows: 
1. 
A request to make court records or a court hearing confidential in any type of case must be 
made by written motion. Parties cannot submit an agreed-upon order. The Motion must be 
captioned "Motion to Make Court Records Confidential" or "Motion to Make Court Hearing 
Confidential". The Motion must identify with particularity the records or hearing to be made 
confidential and the grounds upon which it is based. The Motion must include a signed 
certification by the party making the request that the motion is being made in good faith and 
is supported by a sound factual and legal basis. 
2. 
3. 
The records that are the subject of a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential will be 
treated as confidential pending resolution of the motion. The case number, docket number, 
or other identifying number of a case will remain public. Pseudonyms may be used as 
permitted by the court. Court records made confidential under this rule must be treated as 
confidential during any appellate proceeding in this Circuit. 
A public hearing on any motion to seal a court record or court hearing will be held as soon as 
practicable but no less than ten (I 0) days prior to the notice being given to the public and the 
press and no later than 30 days after the filing of the motion. A party may seek to hold all or

a portion of the hearing on a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential in camera if 
necessary to protect any of the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420(c)(9)(A). The moving party will be responsible for ensuring that a complete record of 
any hearing be created either by use of a court reporter or by any recording device that is 
provided as a matter of right by the court. 
A sealing order issued by a court must state with specificity the grounds for sealing and the 
findings of the court that justify sealing. The order granting the sealing request must contain 
as much detail as possible including the parties' names or pseudonyms, whethe.rthe progress 
docket is to be confidential, the court records that are to be confidential and the names of 
persons who are permitted access. The order must contain specific findings that the degree, 
duration, and manner of confidentiality are no broader than necessary to protect the interests 
listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9)(A). The order will not reveal 
the information that is to be made confidential. The order will direct whether the progress 
docket is to be sealed. 
If an order sealing a court file is silent as to whether the progress docket is to be sealed, the 
clerk shall seal the court file but maintain a public docket with no alternation of the parties' 
names. In accordance with Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9) the Clerk 
shall NOT seal the case number, docket number, or any other identifying number of a case 
that is sealed by court order. 
The Court will direct the Clerk to post the order sealing the court file on the Clerk's website 
as well as on the bulletin board located at the Main Courthouse within ten (10) days 
following the entry of the order and must remain posted in both locations for at least 30 days. 
A nonparty may file a written motion to vacate a sealing order in accordance with Florida 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 (2007); In re Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial 
Admin. 2.420 - Sealing of Court Records, 954 So.2d 16 (Fla. 2007). 
A public hearing must be held on any contested motion to vacate a sealing order. The court, 
in its discretion, may hold a hearing on an uncontested motion. While challenge hearings 
must be open to the public, a party may seek to hold a portion or all of the hearing in camera 
if necessary to protect the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420(c)(9)(A). The movant must ensure that a record of the hearing is made. The movant 
seeking to vacate an order bears the burden of showing that the order is unsound. 
If the identity of a party is to remain ·confidential, all applicable pleadings will be filed with 
the following designation on the front of the pleading: "Confidential Party- Court Service 
Requested". 
The judicial assistant for the division in which the pleading is filed is 
responsible for providing such notice to the applicable parties. The judicial assistant is to 
provide such notice so as not to inadvertently reveal the identity of the confidential party.

This administrative rule does NOT address the confidentiality of records admitted into 
evidence and it does NOT pertain to the statutory process for sealing or expunging criminal 
history records. Motions to Seal pleadings or court records filed in a criminal case must, 
however, comply with this Administrative Order. This administrative order also does NOT 
pertain to court records that are confidential pursuant to statute, rule or other legal authority. 
If a motion to seal is not made in good faith and is not supported by a sound legal and factual 
basis, the court may impose sanctions upon the movant. 
The Clerk of Court, or a deputy clerk, is hereby authorized to open any court file sealed by 
operation of!aw or court order for the purpose of filing documents pertinent to the particular 
file, as well as for microfilming or imaging files, and for preparing a record on appeal. The 
Clerk, or deputy clerk, shall reseal the file immediately upon completion of the task, with the 
date and time of the unsealing clearly marked on the outside of the file along with the initials 
of the deputy clerk. 
13.

OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO· 
CLOSE TRIAL 
RICHARD B. ORFINGER, Circuit Judge. 
*I THIS MATTER is before the Court on the 
plaintiffs' motion to exclude the public from the tri-
al of this case. Notice of hearing was given to rep-
resentatives of the media as required by law. News-
Journal Corporation, publisher of The News-
Journal, filed a response and appeared in opposi-
tion to the motion. Defendant took no position. 
According to the complaint, a man who worked at 
the local museum sexually abused the minor 
plaintiffs. He had first come into contact with three 
of the minors as they served as volunteers under his 
supervision. More than four years ago, the abuser 
was prosecuted and sentenced to prison. Since then 
the plaintiffs have settled suits for damages result-
ing from this abuse against the Daytona Beach Mu-
seum of Arts and Sciences, the Volusia County 
School Board, and the Florida Department of 
Health and Rehabilitative Services. As a previous 
employer of the abuser, plaintiffs allege this de-
fendant failed to disclose information about the ab-
user's record of sexual abuse when it received an 
inquiry related to his employment in this com-
munity. 
Although so many persons have become familiar 
with the case that defendant has listed eighty-one 
potential fact witnesses, no victim has yet been 
identified in the media. 
Relying on a privacy interest in the facts relating to 
the sexual abuse, plaintiffs argue that closure is ne-
cessary to prevent the substantial harm that likely 
would result from revelation of these facts and 
"d 
·r,

FNI 
t entt 1catton as the victims. 
Thus the motion 
calls upon the court to decide whether a privacy in-
terest in the facts relating to sexual abuse suffered 
by the minors provides a proper basis for closure of 
the trial of the minors' suit for damages arising out 
of this abuse. For the reasons that follow, the court 
concludes that this is not a proper basis for closure 
and denies the motion. 
FNI. Previously, plaintiffs moved for an 
order restraining anyone, including the me-
dia, from publishing information disclosed 
during the trial that would identify the 
minor victims. The court denied this mo-
tion. See: Nebraska Press Association v. 
Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976) and The Flor-
ida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989). 
Whenever other interests compete with the public 
interest in open judicial proceedings, "[ o ]ur analys-
is must begin with the proposition that all civil and 
criminal court proceedings are public events, re-
cords of court proceedings are public records, and 
there is a strong presumption in favor of public ac-
cess to such matters." Sentinel Communications Co. • 
v. Watson, 615 So.2d 768, 770 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993) 
( citing Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 
Inc., 53 l So.2d I 13 (Fla.1988)). This presumption 
rests on the most fundamental values of American 
government.

Not Reported in So.2d, I 994 WL 741009 (Fla Cir.Ct.), 22 Media L. Rep. 2497 
(Cite as: 1994 WL 741009 (Fla.Cir.Ct.)) 
"[T]he people have a right to know what is done in 
their courts .... [T]he greatest publicity to the acts of 
those holding positions of public trust, and the 
greatest freedom in the discussion of the proceed-
ings of public tribunals that is consistent with truth 
and decency, are regarded as essential to the public 
welfare." Barron, 531 So.2d at I 16-7 (citing In re 
Shortridge, 34 P. 227, 228-29 (Cal.I893) ). Open-
ness in courts has a salutary effect on the 
propensity of witnesses to tell the truth and of judi-
cial officers to perform their duties conscientiously. 
It informs persons affected by litigation of its effect 
upon them and fosters "respect for the law[,] intelli-
gent acquaintance ... with the methods of govern-
ment[. and] a strong confidence in judicial remedies 
... which could never be inspired by a system of 
secrecy .... " Id., (citing 6 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE 
§ 1834 (Chadbourn rev. I 976) ). These fundamental 
values come into play whenever the court is in ses-
sion, and the presumption of openness applies in 
hard cases as well as easy cases. "The reason for 
openness is basic to our form of government." Id. 
*2 This motion is opposed by various news organ-
izations, but the presumption of openness is of lar-
ger importance than the immediate interest of the 
press in the case of the moment. To be sure, the 
press has a cognizable interest in maintaining open 
courts "because its ability to gather news is directly 
impaired or curtailed" by restrictions on access. 
Moreover, the press is assigned a fiduciary role in 
enforcing public rights of access because the press 
"may be properly considered as a representative of 
the public [for] enforcement of public right of ac-
cess." Nevertheless, the values of openness in 
courts transcend the interests of the press because 
"[ f]reedom of the press is not, and has never been a 
private property right granted to those who own the 
news media. It is a cherished and almost sacred 
right of each citizen to be informed about current 
events on a timely basis so each can exercise his 
discretion in determining the destiny and security 
of himself, other people, and the Nation." State ex 
rel. Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. McIntosh, 340 So.2d 
904, 908 (Fla.1977). In serving the right of each cit-
izen to be informed, judicial openness, of which the 
press is an instrument, sustains public confidence in 
the judiciary and thus serves the ultimate value of 
popular sovereignty. 
This higher purpose of openness is not always ap-
parent in the public scrutiny of the daily business of 
the courts. Depending on the definition of news-
worthiness, it may be possible to dismiss as un-
worthy much that transpires in civil courts. Here, it 
is easy to ask what public interest is served by sub-
jecting these minor victims to the risk of public 
identification. However, Barron teaches that this is 
the wrong question because it overlooks the higher 
• purpose of openness in the courts. 
In Barron, a case involving privacy concerns inher-
ent in a divorce case, the court strongly reaffirmed 
the presumption that Florida civil courts are open. 
In dissent, Justice McDonald saw the question in 
case-specific terms. He would have closed the pro-
. ceeding because "the rights of the public to inform-
ation contained in a domestic relations lawsuit is 
minimal, if existent at all." 531 So.2d at 121. Impli-
citly, this approach would have required the pro-
ponent of openness to show a particular need to 
know facts of the specific case in order to gain ac-
cess. The majority rejected this approach because it 
saw the conflicting interests in broader terms. ''The 
parties seeking a dissolution of their marriage are 
not entitled to a private court proceeding just be-
cause they are required to utilize the judicial sys-
tem." 531 So.2d at I 19, 
A closure request implicates the integrity and cred-
ibility of the judicial system itself and not just the 
immediate concerns of the parties. The balance to 
be struck is not between the people's need to know 
the particular facts of the case versus the parties' 
need to keep these facts private but between the 
public interest in open courts versus the personal 
desire for a private forum. "Public trials are essen-
tial to the judicial system's credibility in a free soci-
ety." Barron at 116.

"the public and the press have a fundamental right 
of access to all judicial proceedings," however, this 
right is not absolute. State ex rel. Miami Herald 
Pub. Co. v. McIntosh, 340 So.2d at 908-9. In Bar-
ron, the court took the occasion to establish the 
standards upon which the presumption of openness 
may be overcome when necessary "to protect com-
peting interests." The court wrote a "definitive 
statement ... to assist judicial officers in this sensit-
ive area." 531 So.2d at 117-8. 
Barron establishes a strong presumption of open-
ness for all court proceedings and records, places 
the burden on the proponent of closure, and grants 
standing to the public and media to challenge clos-
ure orders. Before a court may enter any order of 
closure it must determine there are no reasonable 
alternatives to closure and must order the least re-
strictive closure necessary to accomplish the pur-
pose of closure. 531 So.2d at 118-9. A closure or-
der should be "drawn with particularity and nar-
rowly applied." 53 I So.2d at 117. 
Barron specifies an exclusive listing of those com-
peting interests that may under appropriate circum-
stances be sufficiently weighty to justify closure. 
Closure may be ordered "only when necessary" to 
serve one of six competing interests: 
(a) to comply with established public policy set 
forth in the constitution, statutes, rules, or case 
law; 
(b) to protect trade secrets; 
(c) to protect a compelling governmental interest 
[e.g., national security; confidential informants]; 
(d) to obtain evidence to properly determine legal 
issues in a case; 
(e) to avoid substantial injury to innocent third 
parties [e.g., to protect young witnesses from of-
fensive testimony; to protect children in a di-
vorce]; or 
(t) to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclos-
ure of matters protected by a common law or pri-
vacy right not generally inherent in the specific 
type of civil proceeding sought to be closed .... 
At the outset, the proponent of closure must identi-
fy one or more of such interests that is implicated in 
the proposed closure. Here it is not necessary to go 
beyond this first level of analysis because plaintiffs 
have not connected their motion to a valid interest 
that would justify closure. 
This motion poses a direct confrontation between 
the individual interest in privacy and the public in-
terest in open courts. Because there is inherent in 
the case sensitiye, intimate, and embarrassing 
private facts, plaintiffs seek to litigate their claim in 
a closed proceeding. They argue "[t]hat revelation 
of [the identities of the minor plaintiffs] has the po-
tential to inflict substantial harm upon them [as] a 
matter of common sense." 
There is no question there are strong reasons to 
keep private the facts surrounding the abuse prac-
ticed on the minors by the now-imprisoned abuser. 
The question this court must decide, however, is 
whether these are reasons to secure the courtroom. 
The question is not whether to afford privacy to the 
plaintiffs but whether to afford plaintiffs a closed 
forum in which to disclose these facts. 
*4 Although there is no case directly on this point, 
the present question comes fully within the holding 
of Barron, which thoroughly considered the com-
petition between the people's interest in public 
courts and the personal interest in private facts. ln 
effect, Barron raised the question of the role to be 
assigned to privacy in a system of public courts, 
and the majority resolved the issue by granting a 
narrow role to privacy based on considerations re-
lating to the legitimate expectations of privacy. 
ln the Florida Supreme Court's well-developed pri-
vacy jurisprudence, the fundamental basis of the 
right of privacy is a legitimate expectation of pri-
vacy. Not every fact in every circumstance is 
private, and not every act of government violates

the right to be let alone. The concept by which the 
court separates the appropriate from the inappropri-
ate instance for invoking the privacy right is this 
expectation. Stall v. State, 570 So.2d 257, 261 
(Fla.1990). ln order to establish a right of privacy, 
the individual must establish that "a reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy ... exist(s]." Winfield v. Divi-
.<ion of Pari-Mutue/ Wagering, 477 So.2d 544, 547 
(Fla.1985). 
A right of privacy cannot attach when there is no 
expectation of privacy. Under our historic tradition 
of public courts, what reasonable expectation of 
privacy could a litigant possibly entertain? Concur-
ring in Barron, Justice Erhlich would have con-
ceded the litigant no reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy. He pointed out, "we have ... recognized that 
'[t]he potential for invasion of privacy is inherent 
in the litigation process.' Rasmussen v. South Flor-
ida Blood Service, 500 So.2d 533, 535 (Fla.1987). 
While civil litigants may have a legitimate expecta-
tion of privacy in pretrial depositions and interrog-
atories which are not filed with the court (citations 
omitted), no such expectation exists in connection 
with civil proceedings and court files which histor-
ica11y have been open to the public. See Forsberg v. 
Housing Authority, 455 So.2d 373, 375 (Fla.1984) 
(Overton, J., concurring) (there is traditiona11y no 
expectation of privacy in court files)." 531 So.2d at 
120. Justice Erhlich shows the conflict between pri-
vacy and publicness. If the privacy interest were al-
lowed unbounded scope, it would overcome the 
public nature of trials. Thus a system of public tri-
als must insist that litigants abandon qualms about 
disc1osure of private facts when they place them in 
contest in the court. 
Without rejecting this view entirely, the majority 
nevertheless identified a limited scope of privacy 
within civil litigation. "We find that, under appro-
priate circumstances, the constitutional right of pri-
vacy established in Florida by the adoption of art-
icle I, section 23, could form a constitutional basis 
for closure under (e) or (f)." 531 So.2d at 118. The 
majority thus conceived of two instances in which a 
reasonable expectation of privacy might be found. 
*S First, there is the privacy expectation of persons 
who are not parties to the case. Involuntary parti-
cipants may have a reasonable claim of privacy. 
Thus under item (g), Barron recognizes that closure 
may be justified if the proponent carries the heavy 
burden of showing closure is necessary "to avoid 
substantial injury to innocent third parties {e.g., to 
protect young witnesses from offensive testimony; 
to protect children in a divorce]." 531 So.2d at I 18. 
Second, there is the more limited privacy expecta-
tion of a party. Again, the doctrine of legitimate ex-
pectation is applicable. Alth9ugh a litigant has no 
right to expect privacy in matters involved in the 
case litigated in a public court, there may be mat-
ters extrinsic to the case with respect to which a lit-
igant has a reasonable privacy claim. Under Bar-
ron's item (f), a proponent may be entitled to clos-
ure if he or she carries the burden of showing that 
closure is necessary "to avoid substantial injury to a 
party by disclosure of matteis protected by a com-
mon law or privacy right not generally inherent in 
the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be 
closed," 531 So.2d at l 18. 
Barron rules out closure based on privacy interests 
of parties in the subject matter of the case itself. In 
recognizing a peripheral role for the privacy claims 
of civil litigants, the majority held there can be no 
privacy interest in that which is inherent in the 
case. Because litigation in a public court system in-
volves an inherent tendency to invade privacy, a lit-
igant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in 
the subject matter of a case. This must be so if, as 
Barron soundly affirms, there is to be a system of 
open courts in Florida. 
Applying this standard in Barron, the court determ-
ined the medical history in question should not be 
sealed because it was inherent in the case. 
"Although generally protected by one's privacy 
right, medical reports and history are no longer pro-
tected when the medical condition becomes an in-
tegral part of the civil proceeding, particularly

when the condition is asserted as an issue by the 
party seeking closure .... [M]edical information is an 
inherent part of these proceedings and cannot be 
utilized as a proper basis for closure." 531 So.2d at 
119. 
The same is true in this case. Those private facts 
which form the basis of the motion for closure are 
the facts inherent in the plaintiffs' case. Neverthe-
less, plaintiffs argue their request implicates the 
competing interests Barron listed in item (a) deal-
ing with public policy, item (e), dealing with pri-
vacy of third party, and item (I), dealing with pri-
vacy ofa party. 
Plaintiffs first argue that closure of the trial is ne-
cessary under item (a) "to comply with established 
public policy set forth in the constitution, statutes, 
rules, or case law." 531 So.2d at 118. Plaintiffs 
rightly contend "[t]he State of Florida has long re-
cognized, as a matter of public policy, the need to 
protect minors who come into contact with the 
justice system," and cite statutory provisions ex-
empting records of sex crimes and child abuse from 
public records disclosure and providing for closure 
of adoption and dependency proceedings. See 
Fla.Stat. §§ l 19.07(h); 63.162; 39.408(c). 
*6 To be sure, it is public policy to protect minor 
victims of sex crimes from unnecessary public ex-
posure. The cited exceptions to public records laws 
i11ustrate this as does the practice of anonymous 
pleading. 
However, state policy neither requires nor permits 
closure of public trials on the basis of the privacy 
interests of minor victims of sex crimes. The trial of 
the perpetrator of a sex crime against a minor must 
be conducted in public as a matter of Florida com-
FN2 
mon law. 
Under Fla.Stat., § 918.16, the court 
has a certain ability to clear the courtroom during 
testimony of a person under the age of 1 ~ but the 
press specifically may not be excluded. F 3 A re-
cent statute protecting minor witnesses does not 
purport to authorize closure of the trial to protect 
minor witnesses. FN4 When the state prosecutes the 
parent of a minor child for sexual abuses practiced 
on the child, the trial is not closed nor is there sup-
pression of the identity of the parent from which, as 
plaintiffs argue here, the identity of the child is 
readily inferred.FN5 Indeed, from the reports of 
tort suits by minor victims of sexual crimes seeking 
damages from the perpetrator or those vicariously 
liable. it can be seen that the courts of this state 
conduct cases like the present as open public trials

The court concludes that it is not necessary to close 
this trial in order to comply with any public policy 
of the State of Florida. 
The plaintiffs next argue that closure is necessary to 
serve the interest of innocent third parties whose 
privacy warrants closure under item (e) of Barron. 
The plaintiffs assert that each minor in this consol-
idated cause is a third party as to the other three ac-
tions and thus the trial should be closed to protect 
them as third parties in the consolidated cases. Hav-
ing voluntarily joined to bring the action, they can-
not claim to be third parties to the action nor assert 
a legitimate expectation of privacy in the disclos-
ures that necessarily follow from their decision to 
act in concert. 
Plaintiffs also assert the privacy interest of other 
minors who were victims of this same abuse but 
who have not joined in this suit. There is no evid-
ence that trial of this case would implicate these 
third parties. In any event, plaintiffs lack standing 
to assert the interest of these third parties, and the 
Court will not decide any issue affecting their rights 
unless a party with standing raises the issue. 
Finally, plaintiffs attempt to bring their motion un-
der item (f) relating to the privacy interest of a 
party. To be entitled to an order of closure under 
this item, however, plaintiffs must show that clos-
ure is necessary "to avoid substantial injury to. -a 
party by disclosure of matters protected by a com-
mon law or privacy right not generally inherent in 
the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be 
closed." 531 
So.2d at 119.(emphasis added). 
Plaintiffs argue their identities are not inherent facts 
in the case and thus the trial should be closed to 
prevent revelation of the identity. However, 
plaintiffs also contend it will be impossible to try 
the case without revelation of their names. Their ar-
gument refutes itself. The identity of a party is in-
herent in the case, and that concern alone could not 
justify total closure. This argument is a proxy for 
the ineffective argument that the sensitive nature of 
inherent private facts should justify a private forum. 
Facts regarding abuse form the core of their case, 
and thus it "is an inherent part of these proceedings 
and cannot be utilized as a proper basis for clos-
ure." 531 So.2d at 119. The decision to litigate this 
issue is tantamount to a decision to place the in-
formation before the public. 
*7 As sympathetic as their claim is, it fails to state 
a cognizable reason for closure under the law. The

request to close a civil trial because of a party's dis-
closural concerns with facts inherent in the cause 
cannot be reconciled with Barron. Facts generally 
protected by a party's privacy right are no longer

GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION 
FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT. 18 U.S.C. § 3771 
The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, files its Response 
to Victim's Emergency Petition for Enforcement of Victim Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, and 
states: 
I. 
THERE IS NO "COURT PROCEEDING" UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 3771{b) 
Petitioner complains that she has been denied her rights under the Crime Victims Rights 
Act, I 8 U.S.C. § 3771. In the emergency petition filed by the victim, she alleges the Government 
has denied her rights since she has received no consultation with the attorney for the government 
regarding possible disposition of the charges (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5)); no notice ofany public 
court proceedings ( 18 U .S.C. § 3771 (a)(2)); no information regarding her right to restitution ( 18 
U.S.C. § 377l(a)(6)); and no notice of rights under the Crime Victim Rights Act (CVRA). 
Emergency Petition, ,i S. 
The instant case is unique in several respects. First, in 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was charged 
with felony solicitation of prostitution in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm 
Beach County, Florida. This charge was based upon the offenses alleged in paragraph I of the 
petition. Second, while Epstein has been under federal investigation, he has not been charged in

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 377l(b)(I) provides in pertinent part that, "[i]n any court 
proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime 
victim is afforded the rights described in subsection (a)." There is no "court proceeding" in the 
instant case since Epstein has not been charged with violation of any federal statute. No federal 
grand jury indictment has been returned, nor has any criminal information been filed. There can 
thus be no failure c,f a right to notice of a public court proceeding or the right to restitution. 
In her memorandum, petitioner relies upon In Re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008), 
where the Fifth Circuit held that the CVRA required the government to "confer in some 
reasonable way with the victims before ultimately exercising its broad discretion." Id. at 395. In 
Dean, the government sought and obtained an g ~ 
order permitting it to negotiate a plea 
agreement with BP Products North America, without first consulting with the victims, 
individuals injured and survivors of those killed in a refinery explosion. A plea agreement wa~ 
ultimately negotiated and the victims objected. The appellate court found that the CVRA granted 
a right to confer. However, the court declined to grant mandamus relief for prudential reasons, 
finding that the district court had the benefit of the views of the victims who chose to participate 
at the hearing held on whether the plea agreement should be accepted. M.. at 396. 
Dean is legally distinguishable in several respects. For one thing, the court's discussion 
of the scope of the right to confer was unnecessary because the court ultimately declined to issue 
mandamus relief. lliru:!, 527 F.3d at 395. Also, in offering its view that this right applies pre-
charge, it is noteworthy that the court, in purporting to quote the statute, omitted the last three 
words of section 3 771 (a)(5)("in the case"), words that arguably point in the opposite direction by

suggesting that the right applies post-charge. Further, the court went to great lengths to 
emphasize that its holding was limited to the particular circumstances presented in that case (i.e., 
the simultaneous filing of a plea agreement and formal charges), which of course, is not the case 
here. No federal charges have been filed in the instant case, and this case, unlike Dean, involves 
an agreement to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida and not a 
guilty plea. 1lL at 394. Finally, the Dean court expressly declined to "speculate on the [right to 
confer's] applicability to other situations." Id. Nothing in§ 3771(a)(5) supports the petitioner's 
claim that she had a right to be consulted before the Government could enter into a non-
prosecution agreement which defers federal prosecution in exchange for state court resolution of 
criminal liability, and a significant concession on an element of a claim for compensation under 
18 U.S.C. § 2255. 
II. 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED ITS BEST EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH 
18 U.S.C. § 377Ha) 
The Epstein case was investigated initially by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2006. 
Exhibit A, Declaration of Assistant United States Attorney A. Marie Villafana,, 2. 
Subsequently, the Palm Beach Police Department sought the assistance of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI). Id. Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim 
notification letters were provided to the victim by both the FBI Victim-Witness Specialist and 
AUSA Villafai\a. Id.,, 3. Petitioner's counsel, Brad Edwards, Esq., currently represents-

Throughou1 the investigation, AUSA Villafana and the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist 
had contact with- Villafana Deel.,, 4. Earlier in the investigation,_ was represented by 
James Eisenberg, Esq. Consequently, all contact witJ-al was made through Mr. Eisenberg. 
In mid-2007, Epstein's attorneys approached the U.S. Attorney's Office in an effort to 
resolve the federal investigation. Id.,, 5. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the 
State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. 
Epstein's attorneys sought a global resolution of this matter. The United States subsequently 
agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as 
certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was 10 
preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the 
following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an 
offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she 
would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted ofan enumerated offense. For purposes of 
implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. 
Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared 
to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by 
Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, 
including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if 
any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the 
parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they 
would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No 
more; no less."

IV. Services to Victims and Witnesses, provides the following guidance for proposed plea 
agreements: 
(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable 
efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims' views about, 
prospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible 
official should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving 
notice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but 
not limited to, the following factors: 
(a} The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety. 
(b} The number of victims. 
(,) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea. 
(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions. 
( e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality. 
(f} Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that relaying any 
information may have on the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
Throughout negotiations, Epstein's attorneys claimed that one reason victims came 
forward and pressed their claims was their desire for money. They argued that victims might 
have an inducement to fabricate or enhance their testimony, in order to maximize their 
opportunities to obtain financial recompense. Villafana Deel.. 'II 8. The Government was 
extremely concerned that disclosure of the proposed terms would compromise the investigation 
by providing Epstein the means of impeaching the victim witnesses, should the parties fail to 
reach an agreement. In light of the fact (i) that the United States agreed to defer prosecution to a 
previously filed state criminal case; (ii) that as a result sentencing would take place in state court 
before a state judge; (iii) that if the state resolution failed to meet minimum standards such that a 
federal prosecution was warranted, the victims would be witnesses and thus potential

impeachment issues were of concern; and (iv) the United States was already making efforts to 
secure for victims the right to proceed federally under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 even if prosecution took 
place in state court, the Government determined that its actions in proceeding with this 
agreement best balanced the dual position of the Jane Does as both victims and potential 
witnesses in a criminal proceeding. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA Villafana received a copy 
of the proposed state plea agreement, and learned that Epstein's state plea hearing was scheduled 
for Monday, June 30, 2008, at 8:30 a.m. Villafana Deel.,, 10. AUSA Villafana and the Palm 
Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that they 
had . .14.. Although all known victims were not notified, AUSA Villafana did call attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. AUSA Villafana did this, even 
though she had no obligation to provide notice of a state court hearing. Mr. Edwards advised that 
he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Id. 
The Government has complied with 18 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l) by using its best efforts to 
··see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a)." 
Specifically, petitioner was afforded the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government under 18 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(5). Disclosure of the specific terms of the negotiation 
were not disclosed prior to a final agreement being reached because the Government believed 
doing so would jeopardize and prejudice the prosecution in the event an agreement could not be 
made. Further, although 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(2) does not apply to state court proceedings, the 
government nonetheless notified petitioner's counsel on June 27, 2008, of the plea hearing in 
state court on June 30, 2008.

Section 377l(d)(6) provides, in relevant part, that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be 
construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his 
direction." The Government exercised its judgment and discretion in determining that there was 
a need for confidentiality in the negotiations with Epstein. The significant benefit of obtaining 
Epstein's concession that victims suing him under 18 U. S.C. § 2255(a) were "victims" of the 
enumerated offenses, despite the fact he has not been convicted in federal court, was of sufficient 
importance to justify confidentiality of the negotiations.

I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation ("FBI"). 
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police 
Department ("PBPD") into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had 
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and 
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses.

Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification 
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness 
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three 
clients,--• and-1 Your Affiant's letter to- was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 
I). Your Affiant's letter to -

Witness Specialist, which were sent on January I 0, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). -was identified

status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by

All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when

investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida ("the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation ofFlorida Statutes§ 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys 
sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic 
preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a 
federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008. is 
the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
3The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing- or whether 
-
ever formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg' s representation.

had been tried federally and convicted ofan enumerated offense. For purposes 
of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims ofan enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less." 
6. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an 
express confidentiality provision. 
7. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, 
several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they 
desired a prompt resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in 
September 2007, -
was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted 
to interview- in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any information 
regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be 
consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
8. 
As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution 
to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, 
shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions 
were discussed. One of those victims was- who at the time was not represented, and she 
was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided ofan expected change of plea 
in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their 
involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant 
knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent 
evidence well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I 
concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibilit) at 
trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement. 
9. 
Afterll■lhad been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations,_ contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting 
to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro 
bono counsel to rcpresen •. 
and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was 
able to assist -
in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bona counsel did not 
express to your Affiant tha~ was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
10. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affianl to inform me that 
he represente~ and- and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding 
Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to 
consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider 
contacting the State Attorney's Office, ifhe so wished. I understand that no contact with that 
office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to- so I advised him that, to my 
knowledge 
was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

11. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a 
copy of the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department 
attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein's counsel had ghen 
us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that 
it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represented-
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed 
your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your 
Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
I 2. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
-
and • 
via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 & 7). A notification was not 
provided to -
because the U.S. Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to 
victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light of-
prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith include-as a 
victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
Epstein's counsel. 
13. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards 
did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he 
requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

from Attorney Edwards that had been sent, via Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that

Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully move for a 
mandatory stay of this action under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k), 
Section l 595(b)(l ), and alternatively, under this Court's discretionary authority to 
stay civil litigation, based on the existence of a pending federal criminal action. 
Introduction 
This lawsuit anses from a pending federal criminal action concerning, 
among other things, an alleged assault of the plaintiff Jane Doe, who, according to 
her complaint, on "numerous occasions" provided "massages" to Epstein with "no 
credentials to provide massage therapy" and was "sometimes paid . . . for the 
'sessions'." Comp!., ,i,i 6, 11. A federal statute directly on point provides that 
when a civil suit alleging damages to a minor victim arises out of the same 
occurrence as a "criminal action," the civil suit "shall be stayed until the end of all 
phases of the criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added).' 
1 The full text of the mandatory-stay provision reads: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or 
injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out 
of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall 
be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the 
civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited. As used in this 
subsection, a criminal action is pending until its final adjudication in the trial 
court. 
18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).

Accordingly, a stay of this case is mandatory until the criminal action arising from 
the same allegations is no longer pending. 
The Pending Federal Criminal Action 
In 2006, a Florida state grand jury indicted Jeffrey Epstein on allegations 
similar to those in the instant action (State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 
2006 CF 09454A, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the "Florida 
Criminal Action"). Shortly thereafter, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (the "USAO") began a federal grand-jury investigation 
into allegations arising out of the same incidents alleged in the instant action (Grand 
Jury No. 07-103 (WPB), United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida) ("the Federal Criminal Action"). 
In September 2007, the USAO and Mr. Epstein entered into a highly unusual 
and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement (the "Agreement"), in which the 
USAO agreed to defer (not dismiss or close) the Federal Criminal Action on the 
condition that Mr. Epstein continue to comply with numerous obligations, the first of 
which was pleading guilty to certain state charges in the Florida Criminal Action. 
The Agreement itself uses the term "deferred'' (rather than "dismissed" or "closed") 
to describe the status of the Federal Criminal Action: 
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prosecution in this 
District, for these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by

the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement .... 
Agreement, at 2. 
By no stretch did the USAO finalize, close, complete, dismiss or abandon 
the Federal Criminal Action. 
Indeed, as the lead federal prosecutor recently 
explained, the USAO merely "agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
prosecution by the State of Florida .... " 
See In re: Jane Doe, Case No. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra/Johnson (S.D. Fla.) (D.E. 14), Deel. of AUSA Villafana, 
07/09/08, ~ 5, attached hereto as Exhibit "A" (emphasis added). 
Under the 
Agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to indict Mr. Epstein -
- or to unseal "any" already-existing federal "charges" that may already have been 
handed up by the federal grand jury and sealed - - should he breach any of its 
provisions. Agreement, at 2. 
The period of the deferral continues until three months after Mr. Epstein 
completes service of his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. Id. Indeed, the 
final three months of the Agreement's term constitute an extended period during 
which the USAO expressly retains the ability to evaluate whether Epstein 
committed any breaches of his numerous obligations under the agreement while he 
was serving his state sentence, and, if it so determines, reserves the right to indict

( or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein - - even after he has 
completed serving his entire state sentence. 
The Agreement further provides that upon Epstein's execution of a plea 
agreement in the State Criminal Case, the Federal Criminal Action "will be 
suspended" and all pending grand-jury subpoenas "will be held in abeyance unless 
and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement." Agreement, at S 
(emphasis added). The Agreement directs the USAO and Epstein to· "maintain 
their evidence, specifically evidence requested by or directly related to the grand 
jury subpoenas that have been issued," and to maintain such evidence "inviolate." 
Id. (emphasis added). It also expressly provides that the grand-jury subpoenas 
continue to remain "outstanding" until "the successful completion of the terms of 
this agreement." Id. ( emphasis added). 
Further, it includes a promise not to prosecute movant/defendant Sarah 
Kellen, only if "Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of th[ e] 
agreement." Id. 
Finally, the Agreement provides that the USAO's declination of prosecution 
for certain enumerated offenses and dismissal of any existing (sealed) charges will 
not occur until 90 days following the completion of his state sentence: 
If the United States Attorney should determine, based on 
reliable evidence, that, during the period of the Agreement, Epstein 
willfully violated any of the conditions of this Agreement, then the

United States Attorney may, within ninety (90) days following the 
expiration of the term of home confinement discussed below, provide 
Epstein with timely notice specifying the condition(s) of the 
Agreement that he has violated, and shall initiate its prosecution on 
any offense within sixty (60) days' of [sic] giving notice of the 
violation. Any notice provided to Epstein pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be provided within 60 days of the United States learning of facts 
which may provide a basis for a determination of a breach of the 
Agreement. 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages I and 2 of 
this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of 
the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that arose from the 
Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District, and 
the charges against Epstein, if any, will be dismissed. 
Agreement, at 2. 
Page 6 of 41 
Consistent with the Agreement and its position that the Federal Criminal 
Action continues to remain pending, the USAO recently sent letters to attorneys for 
people that the USAO has designated as "victims." In those letters, the USAO 
asked, "[I]fyou do file a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and Mr. Epstein denies that 
your client is a victim of an enumerated offense, please provide notice of that 
denial to the undersigned [AUSA]." See Deel. of AUSA Villafana, Exhs. 6 & 7, at 
2 (July 9, 2008). The clear implication of the USAO's request (by which the 
USAO appears to involve itself in the instant litigation, despite advising the 
recipients that it cannot "take part in or otherwise assist in civil litigation," id. at 2), 
is that the USAO believes that such denial might breach the Agreement.

Accordingly, the Federal Criminal Action remains "pending." 
Discussion 
I. 
Section 3509(k) Imposes a Mandatory Stay. 
The language of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k) is clear and 
mandatory: a parallel "civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the 
criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added). The word "sha/f' means 
that the statute's command is mandatory and not subject to a Court's discretion. 
See, e.g., Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230,241 (2001) (noting Congress' "use ofa 
mandatory 'shall' to impose discretion/ess obligations") (emphasis added); 
Lexecon Inc. v. Mi/berg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) 
(explaining that "the mandatory 'shall' ... normally creates an obligation 
impervious to judicial discretion") (emphasis added). Cf Miller v. French, 530 
U.S. 327, 350 (2000) (construing the litigation-stay provision of the Prison 
Litigation Reform Act, holding, "Through the PLRA, Congress clearly intended to 
make operation of the automatic stay mandatory, precluding courts from 
exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the stay. And we conclude that this 
provision does not violate separation of powers principles.") (emphasis added). 
One District Court within the Eleventh Circuit recently construed "the plain 
language of § 3509(k)" as "requirfing/ a stay in a case ... where ... a parallel 
criminal action [is] pending." Doe v. Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 950623,

Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 517847, at *1-2 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 10, 2005) 
(Francis [) (staying federal civil action in favor of "a criminal case currently 
pending in state court in Bay County, Florida, arising from the same facts and 
involving the same parties as the Instant action," noting that "the language of 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(k) is clear that a stay is required in a case such as this where a 
parallel criminal action is pending which arises from the same occurrence 
involving minor victims") ( emphasis added). There is no contrary opinion from 
any court. 
In detennining that the federal stay provision is mandatory, the Francis JI 
court expressed that there was apparently no case law supporting, or even 
"discussing the [avoidance] of a stay [under the command of] § 3509(k)." Francis 
II, 2005 WL 950623, at *2. Deferring to the statute as written, the Francis II court 
rejected the plaintiffs' argument that some of the alleged victims had already 
reached their majority. 
See id. 
The court similarly rejected the plaintiffs' 
argument that it would be in the victims' best interests to avoid a stay so as to 
counteract the victims' "ongoing and increasing mental harm due to the 'frustrating 
delay in both the criminal case and [the civil] case."' Id.

II. 
Section 3509(k) Applies to Investigations, Not Just Indictments. 
While there is no unsealed indicted criminal case against Mr. Epstein, the 
government's criminal investigation against him remains open. Section 3509(k) 
clearly applies to stay civil cases during the pendency, not only of indicted 
criminal cases, but also of pre-indictment criminal investigations. 
The term "criminal action" is not expressly defined in § 3 509(k). 
It is 
defined, however, by a closely related statute. Title 18, U.S.C. § 1595 provides a 
civil remedy for "forced labor" and "sex trafficking" violations, but stays such 
actions "during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same 
occurrence in which the claimant is the victim."2 In enacting § 1595, Congress 
2 The full text of that statute provides: 
§ 1595. Civil remedy 
(a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of section 1589, 
1590, or 1591 of this chapter may bring a civil action against 
the perpetrator in an appropriate district court of the United 
States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys 
fees. 
(b) 
(I) 
Any civil action filed under this section shall be 
I 8 U.S.C. § 1595. 
stayed during the pendency of any criminal action 
arising out of the same occurrence in which the 
claimant is the victim. 
(2) 
In this subsection, a "criminal action" includes 
investigation and prosecution and is pending until 
final adjudication in the trial court.

specifically intended that the term "criminal action" would be applied extremely 
broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to ensure that courts would give it the 
broadest possible construction and, for that reason, speci fled in the definition 
provision that "criminal action" also "includes investigation." 
18 u.s.c. 
§ 1595(b)(2). The only reported decision addressing this provision interpreted it 
according to its plain language. See Ara v. Khan, No. CV 07-1251, 2007 WL 
1726456, *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2007) (ordering "all proceedings in this case 
stayed pending the conclusion of the government's criminal investigation of the 
defendants and of any resulting criminal prosecution") (emphasis added). 
Given that the USAO's Agreement with Epstein indicates that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the grand-jury's subpoenas remain "outstanding" (Agreement, at 5); 
the subpoenas are "h[ e ]Id ... in abeyance" (id.); 
the subpoenas are not "withdrawn" (id.); 
the parties must "maintain their evidence" (id.) (which would be 
entirely unnecessary if the investigation against Epstein were closed); 
"any" existing "charges" will not "be dismissed" until after Epstein 
has "timely fulfill[ed] all the terms and conditions of the Agreement" 
(id. at 2) ( emphasis added); and 
• 
"prosecution in this District ... shall be deferred" (id.) (but not closed 
or dismissed) - -
then the only reasonable conclusion is that the Federal Criminal Action remains 
"pending."

The ordinary meaning of the adjective "pending" is "[r]emaining undecided; 
awaiting decision .... " Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004). 3 See also 
White v. Klitzkie, 281 F .3d 920, 928 (9th Cir. 2002) (relying on Black's Law 
Dictionary, in the context of a criminal case, for the definition of "pending" as 
"awaiting decision"); Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 421 (3d Cir. 2000) (relying 
on Black's Law Dictionary for the definition of "pending," expressly because 
'"pending' is not defined in the statute"). Any common-sense reading of the 
Agreement and the USAO's recent sworn construction of it, is consonant with the 
Federal Criminal Action's "remaining undecided" and "awaiting decision." See 
Unified Gov 't of Athens-Clarke County v. Athens Newspapers, LLC, No. 
S07Gl 133, _S.E.2d _, 2008 WL 2579238, *3 (Ga. June 30, 2008) (reviewing a 
public-records request against Georgia's "pending investigation" exception to its 
open-records law, and holding that "a seemingly inactive investigation which has 
not yet resulted in a prosecution logically "remains undecided," and is therefore 
"pending," until it "is concluded and the file closed") (emphasis added). 
' The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit routinely relies on Black's Law 
Dictionary for the definition of statutory terms, including in criminal cases. See e.g., United 
States v. Young, 528 F.3d 1294, 1297 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008) (definitions of criminal "complaint" 
and "indictment"); United States v. Brown, 526 F.3d 691, 705 (11th Cir. 2008) (definition of 
"knowingly" in criminal statute).

III. 
Section 3509(k) Applies Even After a Plaintiff Turns 18. 
The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed supra at 8-9, mandates, 
without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violation of 
§ 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) "shall be stayed 
during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in 
which the claimant is the victim." 18 U.S.C. § 159l(b)(I). Whether the§ 1595 
plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay. 
An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same 
broad scope as the stay provided in§ 159l(b)(l). As discussed above,§ 3509(k) 
stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a 
pending criminal action. One type of civil suit falling within § 3509(k)'s ambit is a 
suit seeking redress for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Section 2423(a) - - just 
like § 1591 - - prohibits transportation of minors for prostitution. The elements of 
both statutes are identical. There would simply be no legitimate basis for Congress 
to differentiate between the consequences attached to violating these two sections. 
Thus, just as Congress mandated under § l 595(b )( 1) that civil discovery shall be 
stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under§ 1591 (even after the 
victim turns 18), the identical treatment should apply under § 3509(k) to civil 
actions brought for the identical violation of§ 2423(a).

Logic compels a rule requiring continued application of the§ 3509(k) stay to 
a putative victim who has since turned 18. 
Consider again the example of 
§ 2243(a). Assume that the USAO is investigating a § 2243(a) violator with two 
alleged victims; one who is now 17, and one who has turned 19. Assume further 
that both decide to sue the alleged offender while the USAO is still in the process 
of conducting its criminal investigation. Why would Congress enact § 3509(k) to 
prohibit the defendant from conducting civil discovery in the 17-year-old's lawsuit, 
but permit him to conduct full discovery in the 19-year-old's lawsuit, including 
taking the depositions of both the 19- and the I 7-year-old, the federal investigating 
agents and all the grand-jury witnesses? This could not have been Congress' 
intent. 
The legislative history to a statute resembling § 1595 is also instructive. 
When Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2255, it provided a civil remedy to any 
"minor ... victim" of enumerated federal sex offenses. See Child Abuse Victims' 
Rights Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-500, 100 Stat. 1783, § 703 ( 1986). In 2006, 
Congress amended the statute to clarify that the civil cause of action was available 
not just while the victim was a minor, but even after she or he turned 18. See Pub. 
L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 650, § 707 (b)(l)(A) (amending § 2255 to permit suit by 
adults who were victims of enumerated federal offenses when they were minors, 
by deleting "Any minor who is [a victim]" and adding "Any person, who, while a

completion of a criminal action. See also 18 USC § 3509(k). 
H.R. Rep. 108-264(Il), 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003), reprinted at 2003 WL 
22272907, at *16-17 ("agency view" by the Department of Justice on bill later 
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595). 
The Department specifically argued to Congress in the clearest terms: "We 
believe that prosecutions should take priority over civil redress and that 
prosecutions should be complete prior to going forward with civil suits." Id. at 17 
( emphasis added). Nowhere did the Department suggest that pending prosecutions 
warrant less protection (i.e., should be "hinder[ed]") simply because a particular 
civil plaintiff happens to reach his or her 18th birthday. 
IV. 
A Stay is Mandatory Despite Resulting "Delay" to Civil Lawsuits. 
Inherent in any § 3509(k) stay is delay to the progress (discovery, trial, 
appeal) of all related civil lawsuits. Congress recognized this in enacting the stay 
provision, which necessarily prioritized the interests of completing a criminal 
investigation and prosecution over the interests of a particular plaintiff in seeking 
personal pecuniary damages. 
Based on this reasoning, the Francis II court 
specifically refused to provide any relief to plaintiffs "simply because the state 
[criminal] matter is not progressing as fast as they would hope." The court made 
this determination despite the plaintiffs' complaints about the "frustrating delay" 
and that "the state criminal case 'has languished for almost two years with no end

in sight,"' finding that this "is a matter to be addressed in state [ criminal) court." 
Id. 
Accordingly, the anticipated delay in this case, attendant to the term of the 
deferred-prosecution agreement, does not change the clear command of§ 3509(k). 
According to her own pleadings, the plaintiff waited seven years before 
filing this lawsuit, Comp!. ,i,i 2,6, and so cannot rightfully claim prejudice from 
additional temporary delay. 
V. 
Section 3509 Aside, a Discretionary Stay is Warranted. 
Even, arguendo, were this Court not to apply the mandate of § 3509, a 
discretionary stay should still be entered during the pendency of the Federal 
Criminal Action. SEC v. Hea/thsouth Corp., 261 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1326 (N.D. 
Ala. 2003) ("No question exists that this court has the power to stay a civil 
proceeding due to an active, parallel criminal investigation."). 
Other federal 
statutes support such a stay -- particularly when the criminal action may be 
adversely affected by the civil litigation. 
For example, under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2712(e)(l), "the court shall stay any action commenced [against the United 
States) if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability 
of the Government to conduct a related investigation or prosecution of a related 
criminal case." Allowing this lawsuit to progress while Epstein remains subject to 
the Federal Criminal Action will prejudice him irrevocably and irreparably. As

provided below, there are several adverse effects to allowing this case to proceed 
while the Federal Criminal Action remains pending. 
In this lawsuit, Epstein has a right to defend himself. 
In the Federal 
Criminal Action, Epstein has a right against self-incrimination.4 
Without a stay, 
Epstein will be immediately forced to abandon one of these rights. 
Should he choose his Fifth Amendment rights, he will expose himself to an 
adverse inference at the summary-judgment stage and at trial. 
See generally. 
Wehling v. Columbia Broad. Sys, 611 F.2d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1980) (observing 
that "invocation of the privilege would be subject to the drawing of an adverse 
inference by the trier of fact"). On the other hand, should Epstein choose his right 
to defend himself in this lawsuit, the USAO will be able to use his responses at 
every stage of the discovery and trial process (e.g., his Answer, responses to 
document requests, responses to requests for admissions, sworn answers to 
interrogatories, answers to deposition questions, and trial testimony) to his 
detriment in the Federal Criminal Action. 5 
' The privilege applies in "instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend 
danger" of criminal liability. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951). 
' This could give the USAO a tremendous advantage in prosecuting Epstein in the Federal 
Criminal Action. See Comment, Using Equitable Powers to Coordinate Parallel Civil and 
Criminal Actions, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1023, 1026 (1985) (observing that "the prosecutor may have 
access to detailed civil depositions of the accused witnesses, while the rules of criminal 
procedure bar the accused from deposing the prosecutor's witnesses").

In this lawsuit, even before civil discovery begins, under the Initial 
Disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and S.D. Fla. Local Rule 26.1, Epstein 
"must" disclose the identities of all the witnesses he would call in his defense to 
the Federal Criminal Action (Rule 26(a)(I )(A)(i)), copies of "all documents" he 
"may use to support [his] defenses" (Rule 26(a)( I )(A)(ii)), as well as the identity 
of "any" expert witness he "may use at trial," along with mandatory disclosure of 
"a written report" containing "a complete statement of all opinions the [expert] will 
express and the basis and reasons for them" (Rule 26(a)(2)(A) and (B)(i)). 
In contrast, in the pending Federal Criminal Action, which is governed 
exclusively by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the USAO would not be 
entitled to compel pre-trial production of any of this information. See Fed. R. Cr. 
P. 16(b)(l)(A), (C), and 16(b)(2); United States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 
1355-56 (I Ith Cir. 1991) (explaining act-of-production privilege). 
Thus, absent a stay of this civil action, the USAO would receive 
fundamentally unfair access to defense information and highly prejudicial advance 
insight into criminal defense strategy. See Comment, 98 Harv. L. Rev. at 1030 
("To the extent that a prosecutor acquires evidence that was elicited from the 
accused in a parallel civil proceeding, the criminal process becomes less 
adversarial.").

Without a stay m place, discovery will proceed, including against third 
parties. 
Mr. Epstein will have no alternative but to issue subpoenas seeking 
evidence from state and federal law-enforcement officers. For example, Epstein is 
clearly entitled to discover evidence of prior statements (including inconsistent 
statements) given by witnesses whom law-enforcement has previously interviewed. 
See, e.g., Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that district court 
properly admitted testimony of prosecutor about prior inconsistent statements that 
witness made to the prosecutor). Likewise, Epstein may be entitled to discovery of 
relevant evidence that is in the present possession of the grand jury or other law-
enforcement agencies. See, e.g., Simpson v. Hines, 729 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. 
Tex. 1989) ("The grand jury has concluded its deliberations .... The need for 
secrecy of these specific tapes no longer outweighs other concerns."); Golden 
Quality Ice Cream Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Specialty Papers, Inc., 87 F.R.D. 53, 59 
(E.D. Pa. 1980) ("[W]here, as here, the grand jury has completed its work and all 
that is sought are those documents turned over to the grand jury by the 
corporations which are defendants in the civil case, the considerations . . . 
militating against disclosure are beside the point.") (citing Douglas Oil Co. of 
Calif v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211 (1979)). 
In response to such third-party subpoenas to law-enforcement witnesses, we 
anticipate that it will be the government, not Mr. Epstein, who will object to

l am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). 
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police 
Department ("PBPD") into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had 
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and 
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses. 
3. 
Throughoutthe investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification 
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBl's Victim-Witness 
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three 
clients, •.•. and., Your Affiant's letter to- was provided by the FBI. (Ell. 
l ). Your Affiant's letter to-was hand-delivered by myself to- at the time that'She 
was interviewed (Ex. 2).2 Both -
and- also received letters from the FBl's Victim-
Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4}. -was identified 
via the FBl's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. 
status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by 
1 Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of"Jane Doe," without identifying which of 
his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, l will address facts related to_,_ and. 
All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when 
they were fifteen years old. 
'Please not" that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to •. and •. are not the 
dates that the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in lhe 
investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBl's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to-
on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
4. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents. the FBl's Victim-Witness 
Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with- and. Attorney Edwards• other client, 
·• 
was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with-was made through 
that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, 
the target of the investigation.3 
5. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (·'the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes§ 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys 
sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic 
preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a 
federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement. notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008. is 
the following: 
"Any pers•Jn, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
'The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing -
or whether 
-ever fonnally tenninated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.

had been tried federully and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes 
ofimplem~nling this paragraph, the United Stales shall provide Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority detennining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less.

' 
6. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an 
express confidentiality provision. 
7. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, 
several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they 
desired a prompt resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in 
September 2007, -was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted 
to interview • 
in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any infonnation 
regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be 
consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
8. 
As explained above, one of the lenns of the agreement deferring prosecution 
to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, 
shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions 
were discussed. One of those victims wasalll.vho at the time was not represented, and she 
was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided of an expected change of pJea 
in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their 
involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant 
knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent 
evidence well before they were infonned of the potential for damages, the agents and I 
concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibilit) at 
trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.

Afier •. 
had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations,_ contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting 
to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro 
bono counsel to represent •. and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was 
able to assist -· in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not 
express to your Affiant that-was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
I 0. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to infonn me that 
he represented- and. and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding 
Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to 
consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider 
contacting the State Attorney's Office, ifhe so wished. I understand that no contact with that 
office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to -
so 1 advised him that, to my 
knowledge .• 
was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

11. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Alliant received a 
copy or the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, lune 30, 2008. Your A rfiant and the Palm Beach Police Department 
attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein's counsel had gi, en 
us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Alliant specifically called attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Arfiant believes that 
it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represente~ 
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed 
your A ffiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your 
Arfiant attended lhe hearing, but none or Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
12. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
-
and. via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 & 7). A notification was not 
provided to • 
because the U.S. Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to 
victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light o-
prior statements to law enforcement. your Arfiant could not in good raith includ •. 
as a 
victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
Epstein's counsel. 
13. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification ofEm~ency, Attorney Edwards 
did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he 
requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

C '··--
This cause is before the Court on the Complaint of the Florida 
sugar cane League, Inc. ("League") . 
The League seeks an order 
requiring a state agency, the Florida Department of Environmental 
Regulation ("DER") , to release certain documents under its custody 
and control, pursuant to the Florida Public Records Act, Chapter 
119, Florida Statutes. 
The facts in this case are as follows: 
DER is a Defendant in the case styled United States v. South 
Florida Water Management District. et al., case No. 88-1886-CIV-
Hoeveler, United States District Court, 
Southern District of 
Florida ("U.S. v. SFWMD") . 
DER, as a Defendant in that case, 
entered 
into settlement negotiations with the plaintiff as 
represented by the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"). 
During the negotiations, drafts of proposed settlement agreements 
and other information relating to the settlement proposal were 
made, sent or received by DER to and from federal agencies and 
representatives, including DOJ. 
DER also entered into an agreement 
with DOJ to keep all documents it received during the settlement 
~egotiations confidential.

On May 21, 1991, the League made a public records request for 
a draft of the settlement Agreement which the Secretary of DER had 
publicly stated as having been received by DER. 
On May 28, 1991, 
DER responded to the League's request by refusing to disclose the 
requested document claiming the document was privileged and immune 
to discovery. 
on May 31, 1991·, the League filed this action, 
pursuant to Chapter 119, 
Florida Statutes. 
A hearing was 
originally scheduled before this Court for June 5, 1991, but DER 
removed the case to federal district court, where it was ultimately 
transferred to the Southern District of Florida. 
The League filed 
a Motion to Quash DER's Notice of Removal, which motion was argued 
before Judge William Hoeveler on July 10, 1991, and was granted on 
September 10, 1991. 
The federal court held that there was no 
federal jurisdiction over the matter as the League's claim arises 
purely under state law, and Judge Hoeveler remanded the case back 
to this Court. 
A hearing was held before this Court on September 
16, 1991. 
Attorneys for the parties appeared and argued their 
respective positions. 
DOJ also appeared, pursuant to title 28, 
United states Codes, section 517, to argue in support of DER and to 
advise the Court of the United states' asserted interest in keeping 
the documents from public disclosure. 
DER asserts that Florida I s 
Public Records Act is ·not applicable in this matter because it has 
been preempted by "federal immunities and privileges. 11 
DER further 
claims that it has contractually vowed to the United States to 
withhold requested documents under the confidentiality agreement

into which it entered with DOJ, and that DER is acting as DOJ's 
agent in withholding the documents from public disclosure. 
This court rejects these arguments. Florida's public records 
law is sweeping in its breadth and requires virtua1ly unfettered 
public access to records in the custody of state agencies. 
Unless 
a statutorily provided exemption permits nondisclosure of public 
records, Florida law requires that all such records in the custody 
of state agencies be open and available for public inspection. The 
parties agreed that there is no statutory exemption in the Florida 
Public Records Act which would prevent disclosure of public records 
received by state agencies during settlement negotiations in u.s. 
v. SFWMD, including the records sought by the League in this case. 
DER has cited no applicable statutory exemption in the Florida 
Public Records Act, and the judiciary is without any authority to 
expand or create an exemption to Florida's public records law. 
Wait v. Florida Power & Light Co., 372 So. 2d 420 (Fla. 1979); 
Times Publishing co. v. city of st. Petersburg. 558 So. 2d 487 
(Fla. 2d DCA 1990). 
Principles of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause 
may, 
in limited circumstances, act to prevent application of 
Florida's public records law where there is a clear conflict with 
an express requirement of confidentiality provided in a federal 
statute. 
See Cummer v. Pace, 159 So. 2d 679, 681-82 (Fla. 1935); 
see generally. pp. 81-82, Florida's Government-in-the-Sunshine 
Manual, Office of the Attorney General (1991). 
In this case, 
although DER claims preemption under federal law of privileges and

immunities, it has cited no specific federal statute which clearly 
requires that the documents in question be kept confidential. 
DER also relies on DOJ's assertion that the documents would 
not be "discoverable" from DOJ in the pending case, and that 
documents are exempt from disclosure by DOJ under FOIA. 
Even 
assuming that were true, it is irrelevant to the application of 
Florida's public records law to documents in the custody of 
Florida's state agencies. 
As stated by Judge Hoeveler in remanding 
this action: 
Thus, while FOIA may provide an independent cause of 
action insofar as the document ~n dispute is also in the 
custody of a federal agency, 
1.. e. , the Department of 
Justice, it cannot be said to displace and supplant a 
state statute directed at state agencies and state 
records. 
(Hoeveler Order at p. 12.) 
DER's reliance on its confidentiality agreement with DOJ is 
equally misplaced. 
A state agency cannot bargain away its Public 
Records Act duties or create a "self-exemption" with a promise to 
third parties to keep records from disclosure to the public.
