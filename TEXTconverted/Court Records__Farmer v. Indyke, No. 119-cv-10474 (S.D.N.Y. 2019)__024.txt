Re: 
Maria Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10474 (NRB) 
Dear Judge Buchwald: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.  We write to 
request a four day extension, from today until this Friday, to respond to Plaintiff’s Amended 
Complaint (ECF No. 22).  We requested this extension due to difficulties arising from the 
COVID-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown of the tri state area.  
This is the first request for an extension of this deadline. The requested extension will not 
impact any other deadlines in this action.  Plaintiff consents to this request.  
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz
