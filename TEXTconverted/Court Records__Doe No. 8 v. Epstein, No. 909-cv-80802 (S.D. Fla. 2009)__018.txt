JANE DOE NO. 8,
Plaintiff,
vs.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
Defendant.
_______________________________/
OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s (“Defendant”)
Motion to Dismiss (DE 8).  Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 8 (“Plaintiff”) filed a response to the motion
(DE 13) and Defendant filed a Reply (DE 15).  The Court has carefully reviewed the motion,
response, and reply, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.   
       
Background
On May 28, 2009, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Defendant (DE 1).  Plaintiff
brings suit alleging Count I - Sexual Assault and Battery; Count II - Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; and Count III - Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of
18 U.S.C. § 2422.  
The facts, as alleged in the Complaint, are as follows:  Defendant, an adult male, has a
sexual preference and obsession for underage minor girls. Compl. ¶¶ 8, 9.  Defendant engaged in

a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economically disadvantaged minor
girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Compl. ¶ 9.  In or
about 2001, Plaintiff, then approximately 16 years old, became one of Defendant’s victims.
Compl. ¶ 9. 
Defendant’s scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit underage, ostensibly to
give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Compl. ¶
11.  The underage victim would be brought or directed to Defendant’s mansion, where she would
be led up a flight of stairs to a room that contained a massage table in addition to other
furnishings.  Id.  The girl would then find herself alone in the room with Defendant, who would
be wearing only a towel. Id.  Defendant would then remove his towel and lie naked on the
massage table, and then direct the girl to remove her clothes. Id.  Defendant would then perform
one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts. Id.
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Plaintiff was recruited by another girl,
who told her that she could make some money, but did not tell her what was involved. Compl. ¶
13.  Plaintiff was picked up and brought to Defendant’s mansion in Palm Beach. Id.  Once there,
she was led up a flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. Id.  Defendant came into the
room and directed Plaintiff to remove her clothes and give him a massage.  Id.  Plaintiff was
frightened and felt trapped.  Id.  During the massage, Defendant touched Plaintiff’s breasts and
vagina, and grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis. Id.  Defendant masturbated himself
during the massage.  Id. Defendant then left money for Plaintiff. Id.  As a result of this encounter
with Defendant, Plaintiff experienced confusion, shame, humiliation, and embarrassment, and
has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries. Compl. ¶ 14.

reasonable fear of imminent peril and sexual assault. Compl. ¶ 16.  Defendant intentionally
inflicted harmful or offensive contact on the person of Plaintiff. Compl. ¶ 17.  Defendant
tortiously committed a sexual assault and battery on Plaintiff.  Compl. ¶ 18.  Defendant’s acts

committed such acts upon Plaintiff were done willfully and maliciously. Compl. ¶ 19.  Plaintiff
has suffered and will continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including
mental, psychological and emotional damages and loss of enjoyment of life.   Compl. ¶ 20.
Under Count III, Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of 18 U.S.C. §

 Defendant’s Motion does not move for dismissal of Count II. 
1
4
Defendant argues in his motion to dismiss that Counts I and III of the Complaint must be
dismissed as time-barred by the applicable statutes of limitations on the face of the Complaint.  
1
Plaintiff responds that the Court should deny the motion because it is not apparent from the
Complaint that Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred because the Complaint does not allege the date
on which her claims accrued.  Additionally, Plaintiff argues that Count I is not time-barred
because Plaintiff had until seven years after she reached the age of majority to file her claim.
Standard of Review
In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a
court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most
favorable to the plaintiff.  See Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007).  To satisfy the
pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, a complaint must contain a short and
plain statement showing an entitlement to relief, and the statement must “give the defendant fair
notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8); see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964 (2007); Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346 (2005). 
This is a liberal pleading requirement, one that does not require a plaintiff to plead with
particularity every element of a cause of action. Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253
F.3d 678, 683 (11th Cir. 2001).  Instead, the complaint need only “contain either direct or
inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under
some viable legal theory.” Id. (internal citation and quotation omitted).  “A complaint need not
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 4 of 9

5
specify in detail the precise theory giving rise to recovery.  All that is required is that the
defendant be on notice as to the claim being asserted against him and the grounds on which it
rests.”  Sams v. United Food and Comm'l Workers Int'l Union, 866 F.2d 1380, 1384 (11th Cir.
1989).
“While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed
factual allegations, [ ] a plaintiff's obligation to provide the ‘grounds' of his ‘entitlement to relief’
requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause
of action will not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (citations omitted). 
“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the
assumption that all of the complaint's allegations are true.”  Id. at 1965.  Plaintiff must plead
enough facts to state a plausible basis for the claim.  Id.
Discussion
Count I alleges a claim for sexual assault and battery.  Defendant asserts that Count I
should be dismissed because a four-year statute of limitations applies to that claim, and it is
apparent from the face of the Complaint that Plaintiff filed her claim past this limitations period.
A statute of limitations bar is "an affirmative defense, and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not
required to negate an affirmative defense in [their] complaint."  LaGrasta v. First Union
Securities, Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11  Cir. 2004) (citing Tregenza v. Great American
th
Communications Co., 12 F.3d 717, 718 (7  Cir. 1993)).  A Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on statute of
th
limitations grounds is appropriate only if it is "apparent from the face of the complaint" that the
claim is time-barred.  Id.; Omar v. Lindsey, 334 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11  Cir. 2003); Carmichael v.
th
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 5 of 9

 The Complaint states that “In or about 2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old,
2
fell into Epstein’s trap and became one of his victims.” Comp. ¶ 9.

Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp., 291 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11  Cir. 2002).
th
Defendant argues that, pursuant to Florida law, the statute of limitations for assault and
battery is four years.  Defendant relies upon Fla. Stat. § 95.11(3)(o), which provides: 
Actions other than for recovery of real property shall be commenced as follows:
(3) Within four years.--
(o) An action for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious
interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional tort, except as provided
in subsections (4), (5), and (7).
Defendant asserts that, based upon the allegations in the Complaint , it was approximately eight
2
(8) years between the alleged conduct by Defendant and the filing of the Complaint.  Thus,
Defendant argues, on the face of the Complaint, the four year statute of limitations has expired
and, accordingly, Court I should be dismissed as time-barred.  
In response, Plaintiff argues that Defendant is relying on the wrong limitations period. 
Section 95.11(3)(o), upon which Defendant relies, provides as follows:  “An action for assault,
battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any
other intentional tort, except as provided in subsections (4), (5), and (7).”  (emphasis added). 
Thus, Section 95.11(3)(o) is not applicable to causes of action falling within the purview of §
95.11(7).  Section 95.11(7) provides as follows:  
(7) For intentional torts based on abuse. – An action founded on alleged abuse, as
defined in s. 39.01, . . . may be commenced at any time within 7 years after the
age of majority, or within 4 years after the injured person leaves the dependency
of the abuser, or within 4 years from the time of discovery by the injured party of
both the injury and the causal relationship between the injury and the abuse,
whichever occurs later.
   
 Accordingly, an intentional tort claim alleging “abuse” against a child, as described in Fla. Stat.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 6 of 9

7
§39.01, is controlled by §95.11(7), as an exception to the four-year limitations period provided
for in §95.11(3)(o).  See H.T.E. v. Tyler Technologies, Inc., 217 F.Supp. 2d 1255, 1259 (M.D.
Fla. 2002) (where language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given its
plain and obvious meaning).  
The term “abuse” is defined in Fla. Stat. §39.01(2) as follows: “ ‘Abuse’ means any
willful act or threatened act that results in any physical, mental or sexual injury or harm that
causes or is likely to cause the child’s physical, mental, or emotional health to be significantly
impaired.”  The Complaint in this case alleges “abuse” under the broad definition of §39.01.
Specifically, Count I alleges willful acts (Complaint ¶¶ 8-13, 16-19); resulting in physical, mental
or sexual injury (Complaint ¶¶ 13,17, 20); that cause or are likely to cause the child’s physical,
mental or emotional health to be significantly impaired.  Thus, the seven-year limitations period
after the Plaintiff reaches the age of majority applies to Plaintiff’s claims in Count I.  According
to the allegations in the Complaint, Plaintiff was approximately 16 years old in 2001.  Comp. ¶ 9. 
It follows that Plaintiff was approximately 24 years old (and approximately six years past the age
of majority) when she filed her Complaint.   Therefore, Count I is not time-barred pursuant to the
applicable statute of limitations. 
Counts III alleges a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a) based upon an alleged violation of
18 U.S.C. § 2422.  That statute states, in pertinent part,
(b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign
commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United
States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has
not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so,
shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 7 of 9

8
18 U.S.C. § 2422(b).  
Defendant argues that, on the face of the Complaint, Count III is barred by the statute of
limitations contained in 18 U.S.C. § 2255(b).  That statute provides: “Any action commenced
under this section shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of
action first accrues or in the case of a person under a legal disability, not later than three years
after the disability.”  Defendant states that, based on the allegations of the Complaint, it has been
eight (8) years since the alleged conduct by Defendant occurred, well past the six-year statute of
limitations.  Additionally, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old, well past
the age of majority under both federal and state law.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2256(1); Fla. Stat. § 1.01.
Plaintiff responds that Defendant’s motion assumes that the action accrued on the date
when Defendant’s alleged sexual misconduct occurred, but that the determination of when the
limitations period accrues under the discovery rule in a case involving sexual misconduct with a
minor requires a detailed and complex factual inquiry regarding when Plaintiff became aware of
her injuries and was able to connect those injuries to the Defendant’s conduct. (Resp. at 5-7). 
While ordinarily a Plaintiff need not negate the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations, 
LaGrasta, 358 F.3d at 845, when on the face of the complaint it appears that the limitations
period has run, Plaintiff must allege facts which, if proven true, would avoid the limitations
period. See Hughes v. Lott, 350 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11  Cir. 2003) (to dismiss a claim as time-
th
barred it must appear beyond a doubt from the complaint itself that the plaintiff can prove no set
of facts which would avoid a statute of limitations bar); Berkson v. Del Monte Corp., 743 F.2d
53, 55 (1  Cir. 1984); see, e.g., Autry Petroleum Co. v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2006
st
WL 1174443, * 4 (M.D. Ga. 2006) (“Plaintiffs' Complaint may be dismissed only if, from the
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 8 of 9

9
face of the Complaint, it is apparent (1) that the statute of limitations has run and (2) that there
are no facts that Plaintiffs could prove that would support a finding that BP has committed a
fraud which prevented Plaintiffs from bringing the action at an earlier time.”)  A review of the
Complaint, however, reveals no allegations which implicate the doctrine of delayed discovery, or
would avoid the running of the limitations period.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Count III
without prejudice for Plaintiff to amend to add allegations which implicate the doctrine of
delayed discovery, if she can do so in good faith.  
Conclusion
For the reasons stated herein, Defendant’s  Motion to Dismiss (DE 8) is GRANTED IN
PART AND DENIED IN PART as follows:  Defendant’s motion to dismiss Count I is denied.
Defendant’s motion to dismiss Count III is granted.  Count III is hereby dismissed without
prejudice, with leave to amend in accordance with this Order.  
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 18  day of November, 2009.
