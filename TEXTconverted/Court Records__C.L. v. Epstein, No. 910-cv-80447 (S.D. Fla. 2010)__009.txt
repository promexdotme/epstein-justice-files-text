PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTEPSTEIN'S 
MOTION FORM ORE DEFINJTE STATEMENT.& TO STRIKE, & TO DISMISS 
DIRECTED TO COUNTIII OF PLAINTIFF C.L.'S COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, C. L., by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Response to 
Defendant Epstein's Motion For More Definite Statement & To Strike, & To Dismi.ss 
Directed To Count Ill Of Plaintiff C.L. 'S Complaint. ("Motion"). 
First, Defendant 
argues that Count III of Plaintiffs Complaint should be dismissed because the predicate 
' 
act relied upop, 1.8 U.S.C. § 2252 A(g), did not come into effect until July 27, 2006, well 
after Defendant's offensive conduct occurred. Defendant then seeks a more definite 
statement,. i. e;, for Plaintiff to allege her date of birth in order to establish when she 
reached 18, the age of majority under state and federal law. Finally, Defendant seeks to 
strike paragraphs 8 through 15 of Plaintiffs Complaint as immaterial and impertinent. 
Defendant's motion should be denied for the reasons set forth below:

I. 
Count III _Should Not Be Dismissed, As Retroactive.Application Of§ 2252 
A(G)(l) And (2) Does Not Violate Constitutional Ex Post Facto Prohibitions 
In moving to dismiss, Defendant focused on the issue of whether Plaintiff may 
bring the claim set forth in Count III of her Complaint in which she alleged that the 
Defendant knowingly engaged in a child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2252 A(g)(2), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252 A(g)(l). Section 2252 A is one of the 
specified predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, although subsection (g) ofthat statute 
. 
. • . 
-
was not enacted until 2006, after Defendant's offending conduct occurred. Defendant's 
argument is premised on the fact that Defendant molested the then minor-Plaintiff before 
subsection (g}ofthat statute was enacted. Defendant's argument must fail. The Ex Post 
Facto clause does not apply because the remedy afforded under Section 2255 and Section 
2252 A is a non--punitive civil remedy. 
The matter of whether these and other such amendments may be • applied 
retroactively is extremely relevant to Plaintiffs claims and the :remedies sought 
throughout her Complaint. Plaintiff and Defendant fundamentally disagree. as to the 
retroactive nature of 18 U.S.C. § 2255Aas well as the interpretation of whichever version 
of §2255 the Couttadopts. The Court's decisions as to retroactive application of§ 2255 
ultimately will critically affect the results of claims brought by each and every one of 
-
·-
-
Defendant's many victims who are currently seeking redress under §2.255. Thus, its 
significance cdnnot be overemphasized. 
A. 
Background_ Of The 2006 • Amendment To The Statute 
• In 'July of 2006 substantial changes were made in Section 2255 and to some of 
its predicate icts as the result of the enactment of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and 
. 
. 
Safety Act of 2006 ("AW A"). One such measure in the A WA wasJhe Internet Saf~ty 
2 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 3 of 13
Act, which wa_s codified in §2252 A(g), and outlawed child exploitation enterprises and 
set a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 20 years for those who act in concert to 
commit at least three separate violations of federal child pornography, sex trafficking, 'ot 
sexual abuse laws against multiple child victims. Another very important change brought 
. 
( 
• 
about by the A WA was Masha's Law1, which addressed child exploitation over the 
Internet. 
Sectioi1 2255 has been lauded as an additional remedy against those who sexually 
exploit or abuse children. Even though the 2006 Amendment provided formore penalties 
for child abusers, the pervasive tenor of the legislati()n was curative and remedial in 
nature. Throughout the Congressional Record of the enactment of the A WA2, the act is 
praised for its extraordinarily remedial quality. For. instance, Senator Bill Nelson and•. 
I 
others spoke of it as a bill to Safeguard children and allow law enforcement to help 
prevent other families from suffering tragedies siinilar to those the Walsh's, L~risford's. 
Ryce's and Masha had to endure. See Id. at S8021. Additionally, President Blish hailed it 
as giving law enforcement the tools needed to go after criminals who exploit childten.3 
11 On July 27, 2006, twenty-five .years after the tragic abduction of Adam Walsh, Congress enacted· 
"Masha's Law" .as a part of the AWA. 
Masha's ~aw, amended § 2255(a) to increase the statutory 
minimum damages to $150,000 and to expind the scope of potential Plaintiffs from "any minor" to "any 
person,who'.While a minor" was a victim ofa specified statute, i.e., one oftheptedicate acts listed in 2255, 
,J includirlg the ony. most relevant here, 2252 A Masha's Law was nam.ed after a 13-year-old Russian 
orphan1. who wa~ adopt7d by a Pennsylvania mall with a history of child.· exploitation. . He sexually 
assaulted heqmd posted ri11de photographs of the child all over1nternet pedophile web sites, which ,are still 
beingdownlmtded every day. SenatorJohn Kerry, one of the authors ofMasha's Law, in his r;em!lfk~. 011 the • 
• day oftheadoptionofthe AWA, highlighted the remedial nature._ofthe legislation, when he said_that it was· 
because of l\1ashcl)hcit C~mgress was finally closing unacceptable looph9les in our child exploitation laws. 
The specific intent of those involved.in developing this statutory scheme was. for girls similarly violated to 
be able to bring cau,ses of action as adults because of the continuing nature of such violations, Subsection 
(g) of2252 A was also enacted on July 27, 2006 as a part of the AW A.

B. 
Defendant's Argument Is Wrong Because It Ignores The Fact That 
Tbe Ex Post FactOClause Is Inapplicable To A Non-Punitive Civil 
Remedy. 
Defendant's argument is rooted in his idea ~hat the application of 18 U.S.C. § 
2252 A(g)(2006)5 to Defendant's act would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the 
Constitution. The Plaintiff was sexually molested by • the Defendant before the 2006 
Amendment was enacted. According to Defendant applying subsection (g) "to events 
occurring before its enactment and would [illegally] increase the penalty or punishment 
for the alleged crime." Motion at 9. 
Defendant's argument must fail - the Ex Post Facto Clause only applies to 
( 
punitive remedies. Manocchino V; Kusserow, 961 F.2d 1539, 1541 (11th Cir. 1992) 
(citing Fleming v. Nestor, .363 U.S. 603, 613(1960)). As the Supreme Court of the State 
) 
of Florida stated "[ a] civil remedy that does not constitute criminal punishment does not 
violate ex post facto prohibitions." Griffin v. State, 980 So.2d 1035, 1Q37(Fla. 2008). 
~ 
"A statute is not punitive, for purposes of determining whether it violates the ex post , 
facto clause, merely because it can be applied in the context of a criminal case." Id. 
Plaintif rs case against Defendant is civil, not criminal. 
Defendant's • argument that 
applying subsection (g) would illegally increase the punishment for the alleged crime is 
. misplaced. Plaintiff is not and does not have the power to bring a criminal charge against 
.Defendant. 1n fact, Plaintiffs requested remedy under Section 2255 and byextensfoh 
Section 2252 A(g) is a none.punitive dvil remedy. 
2l_Justfoe. Stevens notes in Landgraf at 1487 that the presumption· against retroactivity finds its expression in 
the criminal context in the Ex Post Facto Clause. Section 2is2 A(g) alone does not pro~ide for punitive 
damages, although they ate provided for elsewhere in the 2006 version of the statute. Landgraf holds that 
as such it is 'c;:learly fobject to the presumption against retroactivity, since the very labels given 
"punitive" ... daniages, as well as the raticmales supporting them, demonstrate that they share, key 
• characteristics of criminal sanctions, and therefore would raise a serious question under the Ex Post Rricto • 
.,Clause if retroactively. imposed.'

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 5 of 13
Defendant's argument is premised on the general axiom that retroactivify is not 
favo~edinthe law. (Motion,at 7, citing Bowen v. Georgetown University. 488 U.S.204, 
208, 109 S, Ct, 468, 471 (D.C.Col.1988)). Quoting extensively from Landgraf v. USI 
Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994), Defendant recited all· the concerns 
) 
underlying the historic presumption against retroactive legislation, one of whichis the 
constitutional prohibition of retroactive application of penal legislation. 4 Defendant's 
argument is ~orrectly rooted in the premise that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to 
. 
. 
punitive remedies. Unfortunately, Defendant next attempted to use criminal cases to 
improperly over-extend the Ex Post Facto Clause to the non-punitive civil remedy at 
hand. This improper extension should not stand. 
First, Defendant's argument relied heavily on the cases ofU;S. v. Siegel, 153 F. 
3d 1256(11th Cir. 1998) and U.S. v. Edwards, 162 F. 3d. 87 (3d. Cir. 1998). Both held 
the Ex Post Facto Clause barred the application of the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act 
(MVR,A) to defendants whose criminal. conduct occutted before the effective date of the 
statute. Defel}darit' s argument glossed over the key distinction between these cases and 
the matter at hand. In Defendant's cited cases the disputed remedy was punitive; i.e., it 
punished crimina{ activity. In the case at hand the remedy at· issue is a non-punitive civil 
remedy.

This deficiency in Defendant's argument is highl~ghted by Court's opinion in 
-
. 
Edwards, which recognfaed the remedy· at issue in that case (i.e., restitution) was a 
criminalpenalty. Restitution is an integral and necessary part of sentencing, supervised 
~ U.S. Const. Art 1, § 9, cl.3. 
5 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 6 of 13
• release, and probation.6 Edwards at 91. In reaching this decision the Edwards Court 
relied upon the legi~lative history of the MVRA which indicated mandatory restitutiqn 
should be considered a condition of a defendant's supervised release and probation. 
Tq.us, • the Court concluded that the -MVRA' s legislative history evinced a congressional 
intent to . . : . make mandatory restitution under the MVRA a penalty separate from civil 
i 
remedies available to victims of crime ... i.e., to ensure that restitution under the MVRA 
is a form of criminal penalty rather than civil redress. See Edwards 'at 91. Defendant's 
argument ignores the fact that while criminal restitution may resemble a civil remedy ti 
simply is nof a civil remedy. 
This is in stark contrast to Plaintiffs reliance on § 
2252A(g) in her ci;il case 'Yhich provides a civil remedy impose~_under the civil statute 
18 u.s.c § 2255. 
C. 
Section 2255's Remedy ls A Non-Punitive Civil Remedy 
Therernedy provided under Section 2255 and by extension Section 2252A(g) is a 
non-punitive·civil remedy. 
First, in Individual.Known to Defendant as 08MIS7o· 96.jpg v. Falso, 2009 WL 
4807537 (N.D. NY. Dec. 9, 2009),_ the Court analyzed the remedy provided under 
Section 22.55 and held it was clear the remedy was a civil ttjrnedy and was not criminally 
punitive. Id. As the Couit stated, "the Jact that the payment of damages might have.some 
. 
' 
deterrent effect is insufficient to categorize the statute as criminal. The statute serves 
civilgoals." 1d: 8 
§! 18 U.S. C. §§J556i 3563 (a)(b)(A), 3563 (b)(2), 356~, 3663A, 3664. 
&. Other decisions relating fo A WA agree that the legislation is civil and. remedial in nature and not 
violative of rules orstatut~s prohibiting retroactivity. See State v. Bodyke, 2008cOhio-6387 (qhio App; 6th 
Dist. 2008) _· ("[i]he more burdensome registration requirements and the. collection and dissemination of 
additional informatio~ about th~ offender are part of a remedial, regulatory sch~me; designed toprotect the 
public rather[thari] to punish the offender). Moreover, in State v. Honey, 2008-Ohio-4943 (Ohio App. 9th 
6 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 7 of 13
Second, Plaintiffs argument Section 2255's remedy is a non-punitive civil 
remedy is supported by the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Manocchino v. Kusserow, 961 
F.2d 1542 (11 th Cir. 1992). In Manocchino, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed an ex-post 
facto challenge to a different statute. The Court stated that "since the legislative intent of 
[that] [statute] [was] to protect the public, the sanction [was] remedial, not punitive.'' 961 
F.2d at 1542. The Court held the remedy was not punitive despite clear indications the 
statute also served punitive goal of providing a deterrent against criminal action. Id. As 
the Mano~chino Court stated, the "legislative history, taken as a whole, demonstrate[d] 
that the primary goal of the legislation [was] to protect" the public. Id. 
Like the statute analyzed in Manocchino, the legislative history of Section 2255 
points to the fact that the remedy provided under Section 2255 and subsequently Section 
2252 is not punitive. First, the House report from Section 2255's original passage states 
that "[t]he bill also authorizes the pursuit of a civil remedy for personal injuries resulting 
from certain sex crimes against children." H.R. Rep. No. 105-557, at 11 (1998), reprinted 
in 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. 678, 679. Second, the "Background and Need for the Legislation" 
section demonstrates that the purpose of the legislation, including the remedy, was to 
protect children. The House reported that "the 'Child Protection and Sexual Predator 
Punishment Act of 1998,' [ was la response to requests of ... parents and law enforcement 
' 
' 
Dist. 2008) the Court explained, "A statute is 'substantive' if itimpairs or takes away vested rights, affects 
an accrued substantive right, imposes new or additional bwdens, duties, obligation, C>r liabilities as to a past 
transaction, or creates a new right. 
Conversely, remedial laws are those affecting only the remedy 
provided, and include laws that merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy' for the enforcement of 
an existing right.,,Jd. at 7. The court explains that "to withstand the Ex Post Facto Clause, a statute must be 
civil and nori-'punitive with regard to both the legislature's intent in enacting it and its actual effect upon 
enactment.Id at 6. The court rejects the claim that A WA violates the Constitutional prohibition against ex 
post facto laws because it is obviously intended to be civil and non-punitive in nature (id). Because publtc 
safety is the driving' force behind.A WA, the fact that the requirements of the act have .a significant impact 
upon the lives of sex offenders, does not offend Ohio's prohibition on retroactive laws. Id. at 5. But see, 
Basel v. McFarland & Sons, Inc., 815S0. 2d 687,692 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002) (even if legislature expressly 
provides for it, courts will refuse retroactive application if statute impairs vested rights, creates new 
obligations or imposes new penalties). 
7 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 8 of 13
to address public safety issues involving the most vulnerable members of our society, our 
' 
children." Id. at 12. Accordingly, the legislative history of Section 2255 defuonstrates it 
• 
', 
was intended to protect the public and provide a civil remedy for victims of sexual abuse. 
Thus, just like the statute in Manocchino, the remedy provided under Section 2255 and 
by extension Section 22j2 while protective is not punitive. 
D. 
Conclusion 
As a whole, Defendant's argument is deficient because it ignores the fact that the 
Ex Post Facto Clause is only applicable to punitive remedies; Manocchino v. Kusserow, 
961 F.2d 1539, 1541 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Fleming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 
613(1960)). Defendant's reliance on Siegel and Edwards is misplaced. Those cases dealt 
with punitive criminal restitution. Section 2255 does not mandate payment of restitution, 
rather, it provides for a non-punitive civil remedy. 18 U.S.C .. § 2255 (2006); Individual 
Known to Defendant As 08MIST096.JPG and 08mist067.ipg v. Falso, No. 5:08-cd-917, 
slip op. at 2 (N.D. N.Y. Dec. 9, 2009) ("it is clear that the statutory intent was to provide 
a Civil remedy."). Just because civil recovery under Section 2255 is predicated on a 
criminal statute, does not mean that its remedy is punitive. Cf. Patel v. Thompson, 319 
F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir. 2003). The Defendant's over extension should not st8!1-d. The 
Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to the case at hand.

\ 
II. 
Defendant's Motion For A More Definite Statement Should Fail Becauseltls 
Inappropriate And Moot. 
Plaintiff acknowled~es that the date she reached majority has relevance to her§ 
2255 claims. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff does not object to providing her birth date to 
Defendant through appropriate discovery. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant caused her 
severe harm while she was a minor by actions constituting the violation of several 
8 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 9 of 13
criminal predicate acts listed in § 2255. Whether or not certain of those specific acts may 
be found to have been committed after she reached the age of majority will be a factual 
issue that can be determined through discovery like other factual matters. Under no 
circumstances can Defendant contend that he did not violate one or more criminal 
predicate acts harming Plaintiff while she was a minor. Plaintiff has brought her claims 
anonymously as C.L. specifically to protect her privacy as a child victim. For the same 
reason she should not be required to publish her birth date in a pleading that is available 
'· 
to the public, as birth dates are but another Hnk in the chain to identification. In any case, 
since Plaintiff agrees to provide that information privately to the Defendant, his request 
that it be spedfically pled is moot. 
Plaintiffs Complaint without her date of birth satisfies Federat' pleading 
requirements. First, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)2 only requires, "a short and 
plain statement. of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief." Plaintiff stated she 
( 
, 
was a minor when Defendant sexually molested her - which is sufficient under FRCP 
8(a)(2). 
Second, Plaintiffs Complaint provides ample information to provide the 
Defendant fair notice as to the nature of her claims. The purpose of Federal Rule of Civil 
Proce.dure 8(a)2 is to provide the Defendant with fair notice of what claim is being 
alleged and the grounds upon which it rests. See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
Consol., 516 F3d 955, 974 (11 th Cir. 2008). From reading the Complaint the Defendant 
can certainly decipherthat the grounds for Plaintiffs claims rest upon Defendant's sexual 
molestation ofher when she was a minor. Moreover, the Complaint's factual allegations 
raise a right to relief that . is certainly more than speculative - in fact, the Defendant 
already pied guilty to molesting Plaintiff. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 US 
9 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 10 of 13
544, 555 (2007) ("[£]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the 
speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true 
\ 
(even if dm.ibtful in fact)."). Finally, F~deral Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) requires 
I 
Plaintiff to provide Defendant a more definite statement only when the Complaint "is so 
vague and ambiguous that a [Defendant] cannot reasonably prepare a response." 
Defendant has enough information to prepare a response to Plaintiffs Complaint. To 
i 
quote Defendant's motion, '"Defendant's attorneys are 100% certain that Bfaintiff . . . will 
allege that the conduct took pl~ce prior to July 27, 2006." " ... C.L' s date of birth is April 
of 1988 ... and she claimed she was atDefendant's home in 2004;" (Motion at 2). 
Accordingly, Defendant's motion for a more definite statement must fail. It is 
illogical, unnecessary and has no basis in the law. The Plaintiff is not required to give the 
. 
~ 
Defendant more information than is legally necessary just because the Defendant d~sires 
that information for an Affirmative Defense. 
III. 
Defendant's Motion To StrikeJ>aragraphs 8 Through 15 Because They Don't 
Pertain Strictly To The Plaintiff Should Be Denied. 
It is no wonder that Defendant would Hke to· eliminate paragraphs 8 through 15. of 
Plaintiffs C0111plaint; however, his request should be summarily denied. These 
paragraphs are material and pertinent. They describe the child exploitation enterprise by 
which Defendant; in concert with at least thre.e assistants, lured countless young women 
to his lair oh exclusive Palm Beach; where he assaulted them and enticed them to perfotm 
lewd and lascivicms acts for his sexual gratification. 
TaJ<en paragraph l,y paragraph, these portions of Plaintiffs Complaint allege a 
systematic pattern of sexual exploitation of vulnerable minor girls by an oider man with . 
·-·---· vast resources'-and-influence. (110). As part of this plan, Defendant em.ployed agents to 
10 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 11 of 13
call and transport to his residence economically disadvantaged and underage -girls, who 
were unlikely to complain to authorities or would have credibility issues if they did. (,r 
11). Atleast three assistants helped orchestrate Defendant's child exploitation enterprise 
by arranging appointments for massages, escorting the minor victims to the massage 
room, cajoling them to remove their clothes, delivering cash after each massage and/or 
procurement and assisting in taking nude photographs of these.minor victims. (,r 12). 
/ 
' 
The a
1ssistants helped secure a secluded place for these activities, making it more difficult 
for the child victims to flee or for the unlawful exploitation to be detected. 
(,r 13). 
Assistants woy.ld handle introductions and information gathering upon the girls' arrival 
before leading them upstairs. (,r 14). An assistant or procurer would "lead the way" 
instructing each new girl as to where and how Defendant liked to be touched during 
massage. She would then leave the minor girl alone with Defendant, who would expose 
himself, grope, fondle, digitally penetrate, apply a vibrator or coerce the girl into having 
intercourse witl:i him or to perform sexual acts with one of his female assistants~ all the 
wllile masturbating himself. 
(,r 15). Defendant traveled to and from his multiple 
international r7sidences, using the telephone to contact these minor girls and conspiring 
,· 
with his assistants to facilitate his child exploitation enterprise and avoid police detectipn. 
(,r 16). 
These were not isolated acts but a systematic, well developed plan. Defendant had 
a veritable Ponzi scheme by which he secured his young prey, paid them to lure other 
' 
• 
minor /Victims and then groomed the faithful among them to ·become more· and more 
involved with him sexually. In that way, these paragr1;1,phs do pertain to C.L. One must 
.• 
• 
I 
understand the system to perceive how Plaintiff was· drawn in, groomed, and thenabused 
11 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2010   Page 12 of 13
and molested in a slowly escalating fashion. This was indeed a child exploitation ) 
enterprise as described in §2252A. 
Nonetheless, Defendant only concludes that paragraphs 8 - 15 should be stricken . 
without citing any case and with minimal accompanying argument. Thus, this Court 
should see Defendant's request for what it really hL ~ a smoke screen in ah attempt to 
obscure the terrible facts which surrounded.Plaintiffs molestation. 
CONCLUSION 
Defendant failed to effectively argue that Count III of Plaintiff's claim should be 
dismissed. Application of Section 2255 and by extension Section 2252 to Defendant's 
acts does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Plaintiff's case is civil, not criminal. 
Those statutes provide for a non-punitive civil remedy, not criminal punishment. 
Defendant's request for a more definite statement must also fail because the Plaintiff 
sufficiently described her age to state a cause of action. Finally, Defendant failed to 
.provide any legalbasis as to why paragraphs ,8 -
15 should be stricken from the 
Complaint. As stated, those paragraphs are pertinent to the story of whyn Jeffrey Epstein 
molested the then minor Plaintiff. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that the Court deny all parts Defendant's Motion.
