GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' 
NOTICE OF APPEAL & PETITION FOR REVIEW 
OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDERS 
The Government of the United States Virgin Islands ("Government") hereby petitions 
pursuant to V.I. Super. Ct. R. 322(b)(l) and/or 322. l(b) for review of the Magistrate Judge's 
February 26, 2021 orders (published March 1, 2021 )1 in In Re: The Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
No. ST-2019-PB-00080, which: (1) Denied the Government's Motion to Intervene in the Probate 
action as a claimant against the Estate ( order attached as Exhibit I); and (2) Struck the 
Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand (order attached 
as Exhibit 2). In support thereof, the Government states as follows: 
BACKGROUND & LEGAL ARGUMENT 
Jeffrey Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019, while in custody in New York for sex 
crimes. Comp!., Gov 't U.S. Virgin Islands v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, et al., No. ST-2020-CV-14, 
Jr 7 (V.I. Super Ct. Jan. 15, 2020). On August 15, 2019, the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein ("the Estate") 
was created. Id. ,i 8. 
1 Although the orders are dated February 26, 2021, the Government did not learn of them until it 
received a press inquiry on March 12, 2021 . The Government contacted the Clerk of the Court, 
who confirmed that it appears that the Government had not been electronically served with the 
orders. The Clerk of the Court then served the Government with notice of the orders on March 17, 
2021. Therefore, the time to appeal under Rule 322(b )(1) and/or Rule 322.1 (b )(2)(A) should be 
calculated from March 17, 2021, making the Government's Petition timely. 

In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Gov't's Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders 
Page 2 of 4 
On November 14, 2019, the Executors of the Estate filed an Expedited Motion for 
Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program ("Epstein Fund" or "Fund"). The 
Motion asked the Magistrate Judge to "establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution 
program ... for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein[.]" Id. at 1. 
On January 15, 2020, the Government filed a lawsuit against the Estate, the 1953 Trust, 
and numerous Epstein business affiliates and associates for violation of the Criminally Influenced 
and Corrupt Organization Act ("CICO"), 14 V.I.C. § 600 et seq., and civil conspiracy, seeking 
forfeiture and divestment of assets in favor of the Government, civil penalties, damages, and other 
remedies.2 
The Probate Court's ruling not only fails to recognize the Government's interest, which 
supports mandatory or permissive intervention, but also ignores the complexity of this proceeding 
and its significance to Epstein's victims and to the people of the Virgin Islands more broadly. As 
Plaintiff in its CICO litigation, the Government has an interest in the assets of the Estate, as well 
as in ensuring that the laws of the Virgin Islands are enforced for the benefit of the Government, 
the People of the Virgin Islands, and the victims of Epstein's crimes. The Executors of the Estate, 
who are alleged to have been affiliated with various entities that participated in Epstein's criminal 
enterprise, cannot adequately stand in for the Government. Therefore, the Government should be 
allowed to intervene. In re the Estate of Small, 57 V.I. 416,423 (2012); Hendricks v. Clyne, No. 
ST-16-CV-147, 2019 WL 918607, at *2 (V.l. Super. Ct. Feb. 20, 2019); V.I. R. Civ. P. 24. 
2 The Government filed its operative First Amended Complaint in its CICO action on February 
10, 2020 and its Second Amended Complaint on February 20, 2021.

Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Gov't's Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders 
Page 3 of 4 
Finally, with or without intervention, the Probate Court had jurisdiction to decide the 
Government's Emergency Motion. It should be noted that the Presiding Judge in its March 12, 
2021 Order in the CICO action (Exhibit 3) recognized the overlapping issues in the CICO and 
Probate matters. As a result, the Court has asked the parties to brief whether this case should be 
designated as complex and transferred to the same Superior Court Judge assigned to the CICO 
matter so the Probate and CICO matters can be "coordinated together" to avoid "inconsistent 
rulings." 
ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 
1. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Motion to Intervene 
as a claimant against the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
2. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Emergency Motion 
to Freeze All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand based on lack of standing because the 
Government is not a party to and was denied intervention in the Probate action, even 
though it has a claim against the Estate.

1 Notwithstanding the Court's denial of said Motion at the February 4, 2020 hearing, the Government continued to file 
pleadings with the Court concerning its requested intervention. The Court considers the pleadings filed subsequent to the 
February 4, 2020 hearing to be advisory or informational in nature. Therefore, the Court will take no action upon said 
pleadings. The Court notes that at said hearing, it requested that the Co-Executors and the Government resolve their 
differences concerning the Voluntary Claims Resolution Program.

4, 2021, by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands (hereinafter the "Government"), 
by and through Carol Thomas-Jacobs, Esq., Chief Deputy Attorney General, wherein, the 
Government moves to freeze the assets of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein based upon its 
contention that the Estate has breached its commitment to fund the Epstein Victims'

Order 
Page2of3 
On February 4, 2020, the Court held a hearing on various motions in this case, including 
the Government's Motion to Intervene filed on January 23, 2020. The Motion to Intervene was 
argued before the Court on February 4, 2020, on which date the Government was represented 
by Attorneys Ariel Smith and Pamela Tepper. After considering arguments from Counsel on 
even date, the Court orally denied the Motion to Intervene without prejudice.2 Therefore, 
because the Government is not a party to this action and is not permitted to intervene, the 
Government does not have standing to move the Court to freeze the Estate's assets and all its 
cash on hand. As such, the Court need not address the Government's arguments arising 
thereunder. 
For these reasons, the Court will use its inherent authority to strike the Emergency 
Motion and all responses thereto from the record.3 Accordingly, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the: (1) Emergency Motion to Immediately Freeze All Estate Assets 
and Cash on Hand filed by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, by and through 
Carol Thomas-Jacobs, Esq., Chief Deputy Attorney General, on February 4, 2021; (2) Joinder

THIS MATTER was referred to the Complex Litigation Division to determine whether to 
designate this case as complex pursuant to Rule 92 of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure. The 
co-executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein filed a motion on February I, 2021 for complex treatment 
and the Court (Tejo, J.) granted the motion and referred this matter for a determination. In order to avoid 
delay, and to ensure that all issues relevant to the determination are addressed, the Court will set a briefing 
schedule for the parties to follow. The Court acknowledges that, in their February I, 2021 motion, the Co-
Executors reference the related probate matter, In re: Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Case No. ST-20 l 9-PB-
00080. The Court will also direct the parties to address whether the probate matter should be designated 
complex so that both matters can be coordinated together in the event that the Court, in its administrative

capacity in the absence of a judge assigned to the Complex Litigation Division, concludes that the 
litigation involving the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein should be treated as complex. 
Accordingly, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the movants, the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, have leave to 
SERVE and FILE a supplemental brief within seven (7) days from the date of entry of this Order, to 
address, if not already addressed in their February 1, 2021 motion, whether In re: Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, Case No. ST-20 l 9-PB-00080, should be designated as complex, or reassigned to the same judge 
to avoid delay and inconsistent rulings, c,f V.l. R. Civ. P. 92(g); and (2) to identify whether, in their 
capacity as executors, any other civil actions or proceedings are currently pending in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands that also should be reassigned to the same judge to avoid delay, c,f In re Procedure 
for the Assignment & Reassignment of Related Cases & Proceedings, Case No. SX-2020-MC-00087, 
2020 V.I. LEXIS 75 (V.l. Super. Ct. Dec. 3, 2020). It is further 
ORDERED that all parties to this case, except the Co-Executors, and any pat1ies to the probate 
matter, except the Co-Executors, MAY SERVE and FILE a response in writing no later than fifteen (15) 
days after the supplemental response requested above is filed to respond to the February 1, 2021 motion, 
as supplemented. Failure to respond will be treated as no opposition to the Co-Executor's motion. It is 
further 
ORDERED that the Co-Executors MAY SERVE and FILE a consolidated reply to any and all 
arguments raised in opposition to their motion, as supplemented, within seven (7) calendar days after 
the last response is filed. It is further 
ORDERED that no extensions of time will be granted as the time for filing an opposition has 
already passed. All parties are further advised that the Court will decide the motion on the papers without 
oral argument. It is further
