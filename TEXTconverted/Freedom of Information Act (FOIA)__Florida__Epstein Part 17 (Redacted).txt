Attorney: Police gave media 'distorted view' 
134- EPSTEIN from 1B 
They did that Monday via Gold-
berger and a Los Angeles publicist 
for Miami criminal defense attorney 
Roy Black, who also has represented 
Epstein in the case. 
"We just think there has been a 
distorted view of this case in the me-
dia presented by the Palm Beach po-
lice," Goldberger said. 
Reiter has consistently declined 
to comment on the case and did not 
respond to a request for comment 
Monday. 
The implication that State Attor-
ney Barry Krischer was easy on Ep-
stein by presenting the case to a 
grand jury rather than filing charges  
directly against him is wrong, Gold-
berger said. 
The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment was "happy and ecstatic" that 
the panel was going to review the 
evidence. "I think what happened is 
they weren't happy with the result. 
They decided to use the press to 
embarrass Mr. Epstein." 
But records show that Reiter 
wrote Krischer on May 1— well be-
fore the case went to the grand jury—
suggesting that Krischer "consider if 
good and sufficient reason exists to 
require your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases." 
Rather than flat-out decline to 
charge Epstein, Krischer referred 
the case to the grand jury to "ap- 
pease" the chief, Goldberger said. 
A state attorney's spokesman 
would say only that the office refers 
cases to the grand jury when there 
are issues with the viability of the 
evidence or witnesses' credibility. 
Both the state attorney and the 
grand jury concluded there was not 
sufficient evidence that Epstein had 
sex with minors, according to Gold-
berger. "It was just a childish perfor-
mance by the Palm Beach Police 
Department," Goldberger said. 
The defense attorney said one of 
the alleged victims who claimed she 
was a minor was in fact over the age 
of 18. Another alleged victim who 
was subpoenaed to testify to the 
grand jury failed to do so. Epstein's

accusers, he added, have histories of 
drug abuse and thefts. "These wom-
en are liars. We've established that." 
But why would they all invent 
their stories about meeting Epstein 
for sexual massages? 
"I don't have an answer as to what 
was the motivation for these women 
to come forward and make these al-
legations," Goldberger said.

Indictment: Billionaire solicited 3 times 
Palm Beach police will report 
today about their prostitution 
probe of the money manager. 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Billionaire money manager and 
Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey 
Epstein solicited or procured prostitutes 
three or more times between Aug. 1 and 
Oct 31 of last year, according to an in-
dictment charging him with felony so-
licitation of prostitution. 
Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm 
Beach County jail at 1:45 a.m. Sunday. 
He was released on $3,000 bond. 
Epstein's case is unusual in that 
suspected prostitution johns are usually 
charged with a misdemeanor, and even 
a felony charge is typically made in a 
criminal information — an alternative to 
an indictment charging a person with  
the commission of a 
crime. 
His attorney, Jack 
Goldberger, declined to 
discuss the charge. 
State attorney's of-
fice spokesman Mike 
Edmondson also had 
little to say. 
"Generally speak-
ing, there is a case that 
has a number of different aspects to it," 
Edmondson said of a prostitution-
related charge being submitted to a 
grand jury. "We first became aware of 
the case months ago by Palm Beach 
police." 
Prosecutors and police worked to-
gether to bring the case to the grand 
jury, he said. 
Palm Beach police confirmed that 
and said the department will release a 
report today regarding its investigation. 
Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 
71/2-bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a 
pool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal  
Waterway since 1990, according to 
property records. A man answering the 
door there Monday said that Epstein 
wasn't home. A Cadillac Escalade reg-
istered to him was parked in the drive-
way, which is flanked by two massive 
gargoyles. 
Epstein sued Property Appraiser 
Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that 
the assessment of his home exceeded 
its fair market value. He dismissed his 
lawsuit in December 2002. 
A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair 
magazine said he owns what are be-
lieved to be the largest private homes in 
Manhattan — 51,000 square feet — and 
in New Mexico — a 7,500-acre ranch. 
Those are in addition to his 70-acre is-
land in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet 
of aircraft. 
Epstein's friends and admirers, ac-
cording to the magazine, include prom-
inent businessmen, academics and sci-
entists and famed Harvard law professor 
Alan Dershowitz.

1Vlystery money man faces soliciting charge" 
By NICOLE JANOK 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
A part-time Palm Beacher who has 
socialized with Donald Trump, Bill 
Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed 
early Sunday with accused drug dealers, 
drunken drivers and wife beaters after 
he was charged with soliciting a prosti-
tute. 
Manhattan money manager Jeffrey 
Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home 
on El Brillo Way at 1:45 a.m. He was 
released hours later on $3,000 bond. 
Epstein was indicted last week by a 
state grand jury, according to state at-
torney's spokesman Mike Edmoddson. 
Despite Epstein's arrest, the indictment 
containing the allegations remained 
sealed Sunday and Edmondson provid-
ed no details. 
Unlike most accused johns, Epstein 
was charged with a third-degree felony 
instead of a misdemeanor. Under state 
law, a solicitation charge usually is ele-
vated to a more-serious felony when the 
defendant has at least two solicitation  
convictions. 
However, checks of court records 
here and in New York Sunday turned up 
no such convictions. 
Epstein could not be reached. I' 1-
mondson said he was being representti 
by West Palm Beach attorney Jack 
Goldberg, who declined comment. 
Epstein is the president of J Epstein 
& Co., a money management company 
based in Manhattan that caters to ultra= 
wealthy clientele, according to pub-

magazines have described 
him as a "mysterious billion-

He has been in trouble 
before. In 1993, he and two 
other defendants were 
charged in federal court with 
three counts of postal larceny 
and theft and one count of 
property theft. Epstein plead 
guilty to a single charge of 
conspiring to steal U.S. 
Treasury checks from resi-

The remaining charges were

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS 
Because of reporting errors, The 
Palm Beach Post Monday said thatJeffrey 
Epstein, a part-time Palm Beach resi-
dent, pleaded guilty in 1993 to a charge of 
conspiring to steal U.S. Treasury checks. 
That was another Jeffrey Epstein, not the 
one indicted here on a prostitution so-
licitation charge. Jeffrey Epstein of Palm 
Beach has never been charged with 
postal larceny and theft of U.S. Treasury 
checks, has never pleaded guilty and has 
never been on probation. The story also  
incorrectly said that Epstein was arrest-
ed Sunday at his Palm Beach home. He 
surrendered at the Palm Beach County 
Jail, according to his attorney, Jack 
Goldberger. Goldberger's name also 
was misspelled in the article. The story 
appeared on the front page of the Local 
section.

Police kept watch on home, airport, sifted through trash 
► EPSTEIN from m 
suggesting the county's top 
prosecutor disqualify himself. 
"I must urge you to ex-
amine the unusual course that 
your office's handling of this 
matter has taken and consider 
if good and sufficient reason 
exists to require your dis-
qualification from the prose-
cution of these cases," Reiter 
wrote in a May 1 memo to 
Krischer. 
While not commenting 
specifically on the Epstein 
case, Mike Edmondson, 
spokesman for the state at-
torney, said his office pre-
sents cases other than mur-
ders to a grand jury when 
there are questions about 
witnesses' credibility and 
their ability to testify. 
By the nature of their jobs, 
police officers look at evi-
dence from a "one-sided per-
spective," Edmondson said. 
"A prosecutor has to look at it 
in a much broader fashion," 
weighing the veracity of wit-
nesses and how they may fare 
under defense attorneys' 
questioning, he said. 
Epstein's attorney, Jack 
Goldberger, said his client 
committed no crimes. 
'The reports and state-
ments in question refer to 
false accusations that were 
not charged because the Palm 
Beach County state attorney 
questioned the credibility of 
the witnesses," Goldberger 
said. A county grand jury 
"found the allegations wholly 
unsubstantiated and not 
credible," and that's why his 
client was not charged with 
sexual activity with minors, 
he said. 
Goldberger said Epstein 
passed a lie detector test ad-
ministered by a reputable 
polygraph examiner in which 
he said he did not know the 
girls were minors. Also, a 
search warrant served on 
Epstein's home found no evi-
dence to corroborate the 
girls' allegations, Goldberger 
said. 
According to police docu-
ments: 
• A Palm Beach Commu-
nity College student said she 
gave Epstein a massage in the 
nude, then brought him six 
girls, ages 14 to 16, for mas-
sage and sex-tinged sessions 
at his home. 
• A 27-year-old woman 
who worked as Epstein's 
personal assistant also facili-
tated the liaisons, phoning 
the PBCC student to arrange 
for girls when Epstein was 
coming to town. And she es-
corted the girls upstairs when 
they arrived, putting fresh 
sheets on a massage table and 
placing massage oils nearby. 
• Police took sworn 
statements from five alleged 
victims and 17 witnesses. 
They contend that on three 
occasions, Epstein had sex 
with the girls. 
The chief's letter 
See the letter Palm Beach Police 
Chief Michael Reiter wrote to 
State Attorney Barry Krischer 
on the Epstein case. 
PalmBeachPostcom 
A money manager for the 
ultra-rich, Epstein was named 
one of New York's most eligi-
ble bachelors in 2003 by The 
New York Post. He reportedly 
hobnobs with the likes of 
former President Clinton, 
former Harvard University 
President Lawrence Sum-
mers and Donald Trump, and 
has lavish homes in Manhat-
tan, New Mexico and the Vir-
gin Islands. 
He has contributed tens of 
thousands of dollars to Dem-
ocratic Party candidates and 
organizations, including Sen. 
John Kerry's presidential bid, 
and the Senate campaigns of 
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clin-
ton, Christopher Dodd and 
Charles Schumer. 
Goldberger is one of five 
attorneys Epstein has re-
tained since he became the 
subject of an investigation, 
Edmondson said. Among the 
others: Alan Dershowitz, the 
well-known Harvard law pro-
fessor and author, who is a 
friend of Epstein. Dershowitz 
could not be reached for 
comment. 
Police said the woman 
who enlisted young girls for 
Epstein was Haley Robson, 
20, of Royal Palm Beach. 
Robson has worked at an Ol-
ive Garden restaurant in 
Wellington and said she was a 
journalism major at Palm 
Beach Community College 
when she was questioned by 
police last October. She has 
an unlisted phone number 
and could not be reached for 
comment. 
Robson said she met Ep-
stein when, at age 17, a friend 
asked her if she would like to 
make money giving him a 
massage. She said she was 
driven to his five-bedroom, 
71/2-bath home on the Intra-
coastal Waterway, then es-
corted upstairs to a bedroom 
with a massage table and oils. 
Epstein and Robson were 
both naked during the mas-
sage, she said, but when he 
grabbed her buttocks, she 
said she didn't want to be 
touched. 
Epstein said he'd pay her 
to bring him more girls—the 
younger the better, Robson 
told police. When she tried 
once to bring a 23-year-old 
woman to him, Epstein said 
she was too old, Robson said. 
Robson, who has not been 
charged in the case, said she 
eventually brought six girls to 
Epstein who were paid $200 
each time, Robson said. "I'm 
like a Heidi Fleiss," police 
quoted her as saying. The 
girls knew what to expect 
when they were taken to Ep-
stein's home, Robson said. 
Give a massage — maybe na-
ked — and allow some 
touching. 
One 14-year-old girl Rob-
son took to meet Epstein led 
police to start the investiga-
tion of him in March 2005. A 
relative of the girl called to say 
she thought the child had re-
cently engaged in sex with a 
Palm Beach man. The girl 
then got into a fight with a 
classmate who accused her of 
being a prostitute, and she 
couldn't explain why she had 
$300 in her purse. 
The girl gave police this 
account of her meeting with 
Epstein: 
She accompanied Robson 
and a second girl to Epstein's 
house on a Sunday in Febru-
ary 2005. Once there, a wom-
an she thought was Epstein's 
assistant told the girl to follow 
her upstairs to a room featur-
ing a mural of a naked woman, 
several photographs of naked 
women on a shelf, a hot pink 
and green sofa and a massage 
table. 
She stripped to her bra 
and panties and gave him a 
massage. 
Epstein gave the 14-year-
old $300 and she and the oth-
er girls left, she said. She said 
Robson told her that Epstein 
paid her $200 that day. 
Other girls told similar 
stories. In most accounts, 
Epstein's personal assistant at 
the time, Sarah Kellen, now 
27, escorted the girls to Ep- 
stein's bedroom. 
Kellen, whose most re-
cent known address is in 
North Carolina, has not been 
charged in the case. 
Palm Beach police often 
conducted surveillance of 
Epstein's home, and at Palm 
Beach International Airport 
to see if his private jet was 
there, so they would know 
when he was in town. Police 
also arranged repeatedly to 
receive his trash from Palm 
Beach sanitation workers, 
collecting papers with names 
and phone numbers, sex toys 
and female hygiene products. 
One note stated that a fe-
male could not come over at 7 
p.m. because of soccer. An-
other said a girl had to work 
Sunday — "Monday after 
school?" And still another 
note contained the work 
hours of a girl, saying she 
leaves school at 11:30 a.m. 
and would come over the next 
day at 10:30 a.m. 
Only three months before 
the police department probe 
began, Epstein donated 
$90,000 to the department for 
the purchase of a firearms 
simulator, said Jane Struder, 
town finance director. The 
purchase was never made. 
The money was returned to 
Epstein on Monday, she said.

Epstein oughtto shut up, 
be happy with 'Justice' 
I think that Jeffrey EpsteirN 
"camp" should be happy that 
money and power does buy 
justice in this county ("Palm 
Beach chief focus of fire in 
Epstein case," Aug 14). 
The exception: the Rush Lim-
baugh case. But that was at a 
time when Palm Beach County 
State Attorney Barry Krischer 
was running for reelection 
and was not sure he would 
run uncontested. He received 
thousands of e-mails asking 
him to press charges against 
Mr. Limbaugh. It was a good 
political move to do so. 
The Epstein camp should 
stop atta&ing the victims' 
reputation in the media Let's 
not forget — they are children. 
A child's reputation is sacred. 
Also, according to the law, lack 
of knowledge of the age of the 
victim is no defense for statu-
tory rape or any sexual crime 
committed against a child. 
If his camp feels that Jeffrey 
Epstein has been libeled, his 
high-powered attorneys, Jack 
Goldberger and Alan Dershow-
itz, can lee a libel suit against 
the appropriate parties. Accord-
ing to the law, the truth is an 
absolute defense against libel 
Other than that, the Epstein 
camp should be silent and con-
tent with the justice obtained 
from the state attorney. Past 
cases indicate that children's 
rights, victim's rights and 
women% rights are meaningless, 
and often the victim is re-vic-
timized.

n Manhattan's 
Upper Eat Side, home to some of the 
most expensive real estate on earth, exists 
the crown jewel of the city's residential 
town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, 
huge arched windows, and nine floors, it 
sits on—or, rather. commands—the block 
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison 
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro- 
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors. it seems more like an institution than 
a house. This is perhaps not surprising—
until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private 
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's 
largest private residence. 
Inside. amid the flurry of menservants 
attired in sober black suits and pristine 
white gloves, you feel you, have stumbled 
into someone's private Xanadu. This is 
no mere rich person's home, but a high-
walled. eclectic. imperious fantasy that 
seems to have no boundaries. 
The entrance hall is decorated not with 
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eyeballs: these, the owner 
tells people with relish, were imported from 
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, 
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean DubutTet ... but the host coyly 
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any 
case. euests are like pygmies next to the 
nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked 
African warrior. 
Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal. the statement of someone 
who wants to be known for the scale of his 
possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey 
Epstein, 50. admits to friends that he likes it 
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren, 
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered 
face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts, 
and loafers. He tells people he bought the 
house because he knew he "could never live 
anywhere bigger." He thinks 51.000 square 
feet is an appropriately large space for some-
one like himself, who deals mostly in large 
concepts—especially large sums of money. 
302 VANITY FAIR 
Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at 
the town house—Epstein usually refers to the 
former as "tea," since he likes to eat bite-
size morsels and drink copious quantities of 
Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or to-
bacco.) Tea is served in the "leather room," 
so called because of the cordovan-colored 
fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered 
in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a 
huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding 
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling li-
onskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger 
sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and 
guests by the menservants in white gloves. 
Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the "office," an enormous gallery 
spanning the width of the house. Strangely, 
it holds no computer. Computers belong in 
the "computer room" la smaller room at 
the back of the house). Epstein has been 
known to say. The office features a gilded 
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged 
to banker J. P Morgan). 18th-century black 
lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-
foot ebony Steinway "D" grand. On the 
desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de 
Sade's The Alioin-runes of Virtue was re-
cently spotted. Covering the floor. Epstein 
has explained. "is the largest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a prixate home—so big, it 
must have come from a mosque" Amid 
such splendor, much of which reflects the 
work of the French decorator Alberto Pin- 
to. who has worked for Jacques Chirac and 
the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Ara- 
bia, there is one particularly startling oddi- 
ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop 
the grand piano. "No decorator would ever 
tell you to do that." Epstein brags to visi- 
tors. "But I want people to think what it 
means to stuff a dog." People can't help 
but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he 
always has the last word. 
In addition to the town house, Epstein 
lives in what is reputed to be the largest 
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an S18 
million. 7.500-acre ranch which he named 
"Zorro." --It makes the town house look like 
a shack.-  Epstein has said. He also owns 
Little St. James. a 70-acre island in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. where the main house 
is currently being renovated by Edward Tut- 
tle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is 
also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, 
Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream 
IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727. replete 
with trading room, on which Epstein re- 
cently flew President Clinton, actors Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket 
magnate Ron Burkle. Lew Wasserman's 
grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few oth-
ers, on a mission to explore the problems of 
AIDS and economic development in Africa. 
Epstein is charming. but he doesn't let  
the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely 
and calculating, giving some hint at the 
steady whir of machinery running behind 
them. "Let's play chess," he said to me, af-
ter refusing to give an interview for this arti-
cle. "You be white. You get the first move." 
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man 
who seems to feel he can win no matter 
what the advantage of the other side. His 
advantage is that no one really seems to 
know him or his history completely or what 
his arsenal actually consists of. He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one 
of the few truly baffling mysteries among 
New York's moneyed world. People know 
snippets, but few know the whole. 
"He's very eniematic." says Rosa Monck-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in 
the U.K. and a close friend since the early 
1980s. "You think you know him and then 
you peel off another ring of the onion skin 
and there's something else extraordinary 
underneath. He never reveals his hand.... 
He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not 
what you get." 
en acquaintances sense a 
curious dichotomy: Yes, he 
lives like a "modern ma-
haraja." as Leah Kiernan, 
one of his art dealers. puts 
it. Yet he is fastidiously, al-
most obsessively private—he 
lists himself in the phone book under a 
pseudonym. He rarely attends society gath-
erings or weddings or titnerals: he considers 
eating in restaurants like "eating on the sub-
way"—i.e.. something he'd never do. There 
are many women in his life, mostly young, 
but there is no one of them to whom he 
has been able to commit. He describes his 
most public companion of the last decade, 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 41. the daughter of the 
late, disgraced media baron Robert Max-
well, as simply his -best friend." He says 
she is not on his payroll, but she seems 
to organize much of his life—recently she 
was making telephone inquiries to find a 
California-based yoga instructor for him. 
(Epstein is still close to his two other long-
term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher. a for-
mer associate of his at the brokerage firm 
Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, 
and Eva Andersson Dubin. a doctor and 
onetime model. He tells people that when 
a relationship is over the girlfriend "moves 
up, not down," to friendship status.) 
Some of the businessmen who dine with 
him at his home—they include newspaper 
publisher Mort Zuckerman. banker Louis 
Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, 
real-estate tycoon Leon Black. former Mi-
crosoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom 
Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels). and real-estate

personality Donald Trump—sometimes 
seem not all that clear as to what he ac-
tually does to earn his millions. Certainly, 
you won't find Epstein's transactions writ-
ten about on Bloomberg or talked about in 
the trading rooms. "The trading desks don't 
seem to know him. It's unusual for animals 
that big not to leave any footprints in the 
snow," says a high-level investment manager. 
Unlike such fund managers as George 
Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose 
client lists and stock maneuverings act as 
their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his 
deals and clients secret, bar one client: bil-
lionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chair-
man of Limited Brfnds. Epstein insists that 
ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he 
has managed money only for billionaires—
who depend on him for discretion. "I was 
the only person crazy enough, or 
arrogant enough. or misplaced 
enough, to make my limit a bil-
lion dollars or more," he tells peo-
ple freely. According to him, the 
flat fees he receives from his clients. 
combined with his skill at playing 
the currency markets "with very 
lame sums of money," have afforded 
him the lifestyle he enjoys today. 
Why do billionaires choose him 
as their trustee? Because the prob-
lems of the mega-rich, he tells peo-
ple. are different from yours and 
mine. and his unique philosophy is 
central to understanding those problems: 
-Very few people need any more money 
when they have a billion dollars. The key 
is not to have it do harm more than any-
thing else. . You don't want to lose your 
money." 
1 
	
e has likened his job to 
that of an architect—mom 
specifically, one who spe-
cializes in remodeling: "I 
always describe [a billion-
aire] as someone who 
started out in a small 
home and as he became wealthier had add-
ons. He added on another addition, he built 
a mom over the garage ... until you have a 
house that is usually a mess.... It's a large 
house that has been put together over time 
where no one could foretell the financial fu-
ture and their accompanying needs." 
He makes it sound as though his job 
combines the roles of real-estate agent, ac-
countant, lawyer, money manager, trustee, 
and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, 
myths and rumor swirl around Epstein. 
Here are some of the hard facts about 
Epstein—ones that he doesn't mind people 
knowing: He—grop-middle-class in 
Brooklyn. His father worked for the city's  
parks department. His 
parents viewed educa- 
tion as "the way out" 
for him and his young-
er brother. Mark, now 
working in real estate. 
Jeffrey started to play 
the piano—for which he 
maintains a passion—at 
five, and he went to 
Brooklyn's Lafayette High 
School. He was good at 
mathematics, and in his 
early 20s he got a job teaching physics and 
math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan pri-
vate school. While there he began tutoring 
the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace 
Greenberg and was friendly with a daugh-
ter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear 
Stearns, where, under the mentorship of 
both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns 
C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough 
to become a limited partner—a rung be-
neath full partner. He abruptly departed in 
1981 because, he has said, he wanted to 
run his own business. 
Thereafter the details recede into shad-
ow. A few of the handful of current friends 
who have known him since the early 1980s 
recall that he used to tell them he was a

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his 
life—Epstein has said this was in 1986: 
others say it was in 1989, at the earliest—
he has gradually, in a way that has not 
generally made headlines, come to be ac-
cepted by the Establishment. He's a mem-
ber of various commissions and councils: 
he is on the Trilateral Commission, the 
Council on Foreign Relations, the New

"I think we both possess the skill of 
seeing patterns," says Wexner. "But Jef-
frey sees patterns in politics and finan-
cial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle 
and fashion trends. My skills are not in in-
vestment strategy, and, as everyone who 
knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fash-
ion and design. We frequently discuss 
world trends as each of us sees them." 
SPOILS OF SUCCESS 
From top: Epstein's 70-
acre island. Little St.

Islands—he now calls 
it Little St. Jeff: Epstein

dent. Harvard law professor Alan Dersho-
witz says, "I'm on my 20th book.... The 
only person outside of my immediate family 
that I send drafts to is Jeffrey." Real-estate 
developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose. 
who has worked with Epstein on projects in 
New Albany. Ohio, for Wexner, says. "He 
digests and decodes the information very 
rapidly, which is to me terrific because we 
have shorter meetings." 
Also on the list of admirers are former 
senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of 
distinguished scientists, most of whom 
Epstein has helped fund in recent years. 
They include Nobel Prize winners Gerald  
Edelman and Murray Gel-
Mann. and mathematical 
biologist Martin Nowak. 
When these men describe 
Epstein. they talk about 
"energy" and -curiosity,-  as 
well as a love for theoreti- 
cal physics that they don't 
ordinarily find in laymen. 
Gell-Mann rather sweetly 
mentions that "there are al-
ways pretty ladies around" 
when he goes to dinner cite: 
Epstein, and he's under the impression that 
Epstein's clients include the Queen of En-
gland. Both Nowak and Dershowitz were 
thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand 
of a man named "Andrew" in Epstein's 
house. "Andrew" turned out to be Prince 
Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit 
in the back of Dershowitis law class. 
Epstein gets annoyed when anyone sug-
gests that Wexner "made him." "I had real-
ly rich clients before," he has said. Yet he 
does not deny that he and Wexner have a 
special relationship. Epstein sees it as a 
partnership of equals. "People have said it's 
like we have one brain between two of us: 
each has a side."  
y the time Epstein met 
Wexner, the latter was a 
retail legend who had 
built a S3 billion em-
pire—one that now in-
cludes Victoria's Secret, 
Express, and Bath & 
Body Works—from $5,000 lent him by his 
aunt. "Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of 
person who had the potential to real-
ize his [Jeffrey's] dreams," says some-
one who has worked closely with 
both men. "He gave Jeffrey the ball. 
and Jeffrey hit it out of the park." 
Wexner. through a trust. bought 
the town house in which Epstein 
now lives for a reported S13.2 
million in 1989. In 1993. Wex-
ner married Abigail Koppel. 
a 31-year-old lawyer. and the 
newlyweds relocated to Ohio: 
in 1996, Epstein moved in- 
to the town house. Public 
documents suggest that the house 
is still owned by the trust that bought it. 
but Epstein has said that he now owns the 
house. 
Wexner trusts Epstein so completely 
that he has assigned him the power of fidu-
ciary over all of his private trusts and foun-
dations, says a source close to Wexner. In 
1992. Epstein even persuaded Wexner to 
put him on the board of the Wexner Foun-
dation in place of Wexner's ailing mother. 
Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to 
be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled 
by splitting the foundation in two. 
Epstein does not care that he comes be-
tween 
 
family members. In fact. he sees it 11 a c 
as his job. He tells people, "I am there to 	
the 
represent my client, and if my client needs 	
by 
protecting—sometimes even from his own 	
at 1 
family—then it's often better that people

being so brutal as to be "irresponsible." 
One reporter; in fact, received three threats 
from Epstein while preparing a piece. They 
were delivered in a jocular tone, but the 
message was clear: There-will be trouble 
for your family if I don't like the article. 
On the other hand, Epstein is clearly 
very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an 
Aspen-based venture capitalist, who has 
known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns 
days. can't say enough nice things: "I have 
a boy who's dyslexic, and Jeffrey's gotten 
close to him over the years.... Jeffrey got 
him into music. He bought him his first 
piano. And then as he got to school he had 
difficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got 
him interested in taking flying lessons." 
Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling 
her that her. daughter. Domenica, who suf-
fers from Down syndrome. needed the sun, 
and that Rosa should feel free to bring her 
to his house in Palm Beach anytime. 
Some friends remember that in the late 
80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the air-
line tickets of good friends by affixing first-
class stickers: the only problem was that the 
stickers turned our to be unofficial. Some-
times the technique worked. but other times 
it didn't. and the unwitting recipients found 
themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has 
claimed that he paid for the upgrades, and 
had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of 
_those who benefited from Epstein's largesse 
claim that his generosity comes with no 
strings attached. "I never felt he wanted 
anything from me in return." says one old 
friend. who received a first-class upgrade. 
E 
pstein is known about town 
as a man who loves wom-
en—lots of them, mostly 
young. Model types have 
been heard saying they are 
full of gratitude to Epstein 
for flying them around. and 
he is a familiar face to many of the Victo-
ria's Secret girls. One young woman recalls 
being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to 
a concert at Epstein's town house. where 
the women seemed to outnumber the men 
by far. "These were not women you'd see 
at Upper East Side dinners." the woman 
recalls. "Many seemed foreign and dressed 
a little bizarrely." This same guest also at-
tended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell 
that Prince Andrew attended, which was 
filled, she says. with young Russian mod-
els. "Some of the guests were horrified," 
the woman says. 
"He's reckless," says a former business 
associate, "and he's gotten more so. Mon-
ey does that to you. He's breaking the oath 
he made to himself—that he would never 
do anything that would expose him in the  
media. Right now, in the wake of the pub-
licity following his trip with Clinton, he 
must be in a very difficult place." 
A
ccording to S.E.C. and 
other legal documents un-
earthed by Vanity Fair, 
Epstein may have good 
reason to keep his past 
cloaked in secrecy: his real 
mentor. it might seem, was 
not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffen- 
berg, 57, who, for a few months before the 
S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993, was 
trying to buy the New York Post. He is cur- 
rently incarcerated in the Federal Medical 
Center in Devens. Massachusetts. serving a 
20-year sentence for bilking investors out of 
more than 5450 million in one of the lamest 
Ponzi schemes in American history. 
When Epstein met Hoffenberg in Lon-
don in the 1980s, the latter was the char- 
ismatic, audacious head of the Towers 
Financial Corporation. a collection agency 
that was supposed to buy debts that peo-
ple owed to hospitals. banks, and phone 
companies. But HotTenbere began using 
company funds to pay off earlier investors 
and service a lavish lifestyle that included a 
mansion on Long Island. homes on Man-
hattan's Sutton Place and in Florida. and a 
fleet of cars and planes. 
Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in 
common. Both were smart and obsessed 
with making money. Both were from Brook-
lyn. According to Hoffenberg. the two men 
were introduced by Douglas Leese. a de-
fense contractor. Epstein has said they were 
introduced by John Mitchell. the late attor-
ney general. 
Epstein had been running International 
Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.). a consulting 
company. out of his apartment in the Solo 
building on East 66th Street in New York. 
Though he has claimed that he managed 
money for billionaires only, in a 1989 dep-
osition he testified that he spent SO per-
cent of his time helping people recover 
stolen money from fraudulent brokers and 
lawyers. He was also not above entering 
into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals 
with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that 
Michael Stroll, the former head of Wil-
liams Electronics Inc.. filed against Epstein 
shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an in-
vestment from Stroll of 5450.000. which 
Epstein put into oil. In 1984, Stroll asked 
for his money back: four years later he had 
received only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit. 
after Epstein claimed in court, among oth-
er things, that the check for $10,000 was for 
a horse he'd bought from Stroll. "My net 
worth never exceeded four and a half mil-
lion dollars." Stroll has said. 
Hoffenberg, says a close friend, "really 
liked Jeffrey.... Jeffrey has a way of getting 
under your skin, and he was under Hof- 
fenberg's." Also appealing to Hoffenberg 
were Epstein's social connections; they in- 
cluded oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the 
designer Vera) and Mohan Murjani, whose 
clothing company grew into Gloria Van- 
derbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even then. 
One friend recalls that when he took Cana-
dian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he 
hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the oc- 
casion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.) 
In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources. 
set Epstein up in the offices he still occu- 
pies in the Villard House. on Madison Av- 
enue. across a courtyard from the restaurant 
Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new pro- 
tégé as a consultant at 525.000 a month, 
and the relationship flourished. "They trav-
eled everywheie together—on Hoffenberg's 
plane. all around the world, they were al-
ways together," says a source. Hoffenberg 
has claimed that Epstein confided in him. 
saying. for example. that he had left Bear 
Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered ex-
ecuting "illegal operations." 
Several of Epsteiris bear Stearns contem-
poraries recall that Epstein left the compa-
ny very• suddenly. Within the company there 
were rumors also that he was involved in a 
technical infringement, and it was thought 
that the executive committee asked that he 
resign after his two supporters. Ace Green-
berg and Jimmy Clyne. were outnumbered. 
Greenberg says he can't recall this: Clyne 
denies it happened. and Epstein has de-
nied it as well. "Jeffrey Epstein left Bear 
Stearns of his own volition." says Cane. 
"It was never suggested that he leave by 
any member of management. and manage-
ment never looked into any improprieties 
by him. Jeffrey said specifically. 'I don't 
want to work for anybody else. I want to 
work for myself.— Yet. this is not the story 
that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and 
to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a 
civil business case in Philadelphia. 
In 1981 the S.E.C.'s Jonathan Harris and 
Robert Blackburn took Epstein's testimony 
and that of other Bear Steams employees in 
part of what became a protracted case 
about insider trading around a tender offer 
placed on March II. 1981. by the Seagram 
Company Lid for St. Joe Minerals Corp. 
Ultimately several Italian and Swiss in-
vestors were found guilty. including Italian 
financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used 
his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar 
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about 
the tender offer. 
After the tender offer was announced.

contains a parody of Affleck and Matt Da-
ton making Good Will Hunting II, Meek 
sys to Damon, "What do I keep telling you? 
hu gotta do the safe picture, then you do 
is art picture. Then sometimes you gotta 
d the payback picture because your friend 
sys you owe him. Then sometimes you got-
ugo back to the well." 
'Sometimes you do Reindeer Games," 
Dimon says derisively. 
"That's just mean," Affleck whines. 
But it's a pretty accurate description of 
hi career to date. "Ben takes these franchise 
poperties so he can go and experiment," 
sas Harvey Weinstein. 
"He believes in trying to stretch himself 
ad not/keep doing the same thing," ob-
saves Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck 
inArmageddon. "He's an awesome actor, 
and I think he's going to do great things." 
Several years ago, in a televised interview 
onlnside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that 
hisgoal was to make big commercial movies. 
He has since revised his ambitions. "That's 
an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd 
raker be in movies like Magnolia, which I 
rind( is a towering achievement. I'll con-
tinue to act, but I won't act in a way that 
requires me to hang my name out there 
and do a lot of publicity. I'll do character 
roles and focus on writing and directing. It 
doesn't require the same kinds of sacri-
fles in terms of quality of life and person-
al life. and it's a more holistic approach to 
the process. It's become increasingly frus- 
trating for me to have my role in the story- 
telling process limited to one character. You 
hate to be respectful and judicious about  
your input when it's somebody else's project." 
Affleck has always impressed colleagues 
with his voracious appetite for information 
and skills. "He has made it a point to learn 
everything he can about how the business 
works—not just the craft of acting, but 
from the producing standpoint, from the 
studio standpoint." says Jon Gordon, exec-
utive vice president of production at Mira-
max. "He knows how deals work. It's what 
sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio 
at some point, he could. He's about as 
sharp as they come." 
A ffleck is already juggling his acting with 
screenwriting and such other commit-
ments as Project Greenlight. the contest he 
and Damon started to help launch the ca-
reers of young filmmakers. Affleck's friends 
are certain he'll be directing soon. "There's 
no question," Weinstein says. "Both he and 
Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the 
rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll 
be home runs in both instances." 
But there are other thoughts tickling the 
back of Affleck's mind as well. A passion-
ate liberal. he campaigned for Al Gore, 
cares deeply about political issues. and is 
extremely well informed. He entertains him-
self by writing imaginary political speeches 
in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS 
in Africa than his movie career. 
When Lopez goes to Alfleck's mother's 
house for dinner. Weinstein reports. "J.Lo 
told me that the conversation at the table is 
always about politics—about government 
initiatives. educational initiatives. what's go-
ing on in the day.- 
So is Afteck planning to become the lib-
erals' answer to Ronald Reagan.' He admits 
that he entertains the thought of someday 
running for Congress, at least: 
 
"I think there's 
a real nobility to public service. h would be 
fun to run on a platform I really he!:.-. ed 
in, without any of the kind of compron, ds 
people make—without being beholden 
the win-at-all-costs mentality." 
And the invasion of privacy would he 
nothing new. "What are you going to say 
about me that hasn't already been said? I 
don't cheat. I don't drink, I don't do drugs. 
I live a clean life," Affleck says, his eyes 
twinkling. 
"He's only 30 years old," says Jennifer 
Todd. who co-produced Boiler Room. "He 
still has an enormous amount of time to 
do things." 
Time, and drive. "I think he's incredibly 
hungry." says Sean Bailey. who founded 
the media and production company Live-
Planet with Affleck. Damon. and Chris 
Moore. "I think the guy has very grand 
aspirations. I don't think he's going to be 
content with just being a movie star. He 
knows he has the potential to do very big 
things." 
Such ambitions could be derailed by any 
number of miscalculations. including a pri-
vate life that generates too many sensational 
headlines, but Affleck has a clear idea of 
the ultimate goal. "On my deathbed. I have 
to be one who looks back and feels I lived 
a good and substantial and meaningful 
life.-  he says. 
In the meantime. Iloilo- or. there's a wed-
ding to plan. 
Jeffrev Epstein 
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 103 Bear Stearns 
and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear 
Steams on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped 
off that Epstein had information on insider 
trading at Bear Stearns. and it was therefore 
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testi-
mony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed 
that he had found "offensive" the way Bear 
Stearns management had handled a disci-
plinary action following its discovery that he 
had committed a possible "Reg D" viola-
tion—evidently he had lent money to his clos-
est friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said 
that he'd lent approximately $20,000 to War-
ren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action 
could have been considered improper, al-
though Epstein claimed he had not realized 
this until afterward. 
According to Epstein, Bear Stearns man-
agement had questioned him about the loan 
around March 4. The questioners, Epstein 
said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and 
u1.11r-u Inn, 
Alvin Einbender. In his 1989 deposition Ep-
stein recalled that the partner who had made 
an "issue" of the matter was Marvin David-
son. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met 
with Tarnopol and Einbender again, and the 
two partners told him that the executive com-
mittee had weighed the offense. together with 
previous "carelessness" over expenses, and 
he would be fined S2.500. 
"There was discussion whether, in fact, I 
had ever put in an airline ticket for some-
one else and not myself and I said that it 
was possible, ... since my secretary han-
dles my expenses.-  Epstein told the S.E.C. 
In his 1989 testimony he stated that the 
"Reg D" incident had cost him a shot at 
partnership that year. 
What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially 
interested in was whether there was a con-
nection between Epstein's leaving and the 
alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals 
by other people at Bear Stearns: 
Q: Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may 
have been circulating around your firm in con- 
nection with your reasons for leaving the firm? 
A: I'm aware that there were many rumors. 
Q: What were the rumors you heard? 
A: Nothing to do with St. Joe. 
Q: Can you relate what you heard? 
A: It was haying to do with an illicit atTair 
with a secretary. 
Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggest-
ing that you had made a presentation or com-
munication to the Executive Committee con-
cerning alleged improprieties by other mem-
bers or employees of Bear Stearns? 
A: I, in fact, have heard that rumor. but it's been 
from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week. 
Q: Have you heard it from anyone else? 
A: No. 
A little later the interview focuses on 
James Cayne: 
Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear 
Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or ii:- 
sider information in connection with St ,• • 
Minerals Corporation? 
A: No. 
Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation 
with you about St. Joe Minerals? 
A: No. 
Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversa-

?Jeffrey Epstein 
lions between Mr. Cayne and anyone else re- 
garding St. Joe Minerals? 
A: No. 
And still later in the questioning comes this 
exchange: 
Q: Have you had any type of business deal-
ings with Mr. Cayne? 
A: There's no relationship with Bear Stearns. 
Q: Pardon? 
A: Other than Bear Stearns. no. 
Q: Have you been a participant in any type of 
business venture with Mr. Cayne? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you have any expectation of participat-
ing iniany business venture with Mr. Cayne? 
A: Nd. 
Q: Have you had any business participations 
with- Mr. Theram? 
A: No; nor do I anticipate any. 
Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns 
ell you in words or substance that you should 
lot divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to 
he staff of the Securities and Exchange Corn-
nission? 
A: No. 
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way. 
ether directly or indirectly. in words or sub-
lance. that your compensation for this past 
star or any future monies coming to you from 
Bear Stearns will be contingent upon tour not 
divulging information to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission? 
A No. 
Despite the circumstances of Epstein's 
leaving. Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his 
annual bonus—which he anticipated as be-
irn, approximately S100.000. 
The S.E.C. never brought any charges 
against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider 
trading in St. Joe. but its questioning seems 
to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's 
answers. Some sources have wondered 
why, if he was such a big producer at Bear 
Stearns. he would have given it up over a 
mere $2.500 fine. 
Certainly the years after Epstein left the 
firm were not obviously prosperous ones. 
His luck didn't seem to change until he met 
HotTenberg. 
ne of Epstein's first assignments for Hof- 
fenberg was to mastermind doomed bids 
to take over Pan American World Airways in 
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. 
Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before 
a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up 
with the idea of financing these bids through 
Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois 
insurance companies, Associated Life and 
United Fire. "He was hired by us to work on 
the securities side of the insurance companies 
and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a 
profit for us and for the companies,-  Holten-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also 
alleged that Epstein was the "technician.-  ex- 
ecuting the schemes, although, having no 
broker's license, he had to rely on others to 
make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg's sub- 
sequent testimony in his criminal case has 
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed 
he was merely asked how the bids could be 
accomplished and has said he had nothing 
to do with the financing of them. Yet Rich- 
ard Allen, the former treasurer of United 
Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three 
times at the company. He and another ex-
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finances. And in his deposition 
of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one 
who executed "all" HotTenberg's instructions 
to buy and sell the stock. He called it "mak-
ing the orders." He could not recall whether 
he had chosen the brokers used. 
To win approval from the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Towers's acquisition of 
the companies. HotTenberg promised to in-
ject $3 million of new capital into them. In 
fact, in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg 
claimed that he. his chief operating officer. 
Mitchell Brater, and Epstein came up with a 
scheme to steal 53 million of the insurance 
companies' bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock. -..ieffie Epstein and Mitch Brater 
arranged the various brokerage accounts for 
the bonds to be placed with in New York. 
and I think one in Chicago. Rodman & Ren-
shaw." HotTenberg reportedly said. Then. 
said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as 
though they were investing the bonds in 
much safer financial instruments. they used 
them as collateral to buy the stock. '-Ep-
stein was the person in charge of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Brater was assisting 
him with it in coordination on behalf of the 
insurance companies' money." Hoffenberg 
claimed at the time. 
At one point. according to HotTenberg. 
broker forged the documents necessary for a 
$1.8 million check to be wrinen on insurance-
company funds. The check was used to buy 
more stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to throw the insurance regula-
tors otT. the S1.8 million was reported as being 
safely invested in a money-market account. 
United Fire's former chief financial officer 
Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg's 
account. He says he recalls making one or 
two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffen-
berg's direction) about the missing bonds. 
"He said, 'Oh. yeah. they still exist.' But we 
found out later that he had sold those assets 
... leveraged them ... [and] used some mar-
gin account to take some positions in ... 
Emery and Pan Am." says Payton. 
Epstein's extraordinary creativity was, ac-
cording to HotTenberg, responsible for the 
purchase by the insurance companies of a 
$500.000 bond, with no money down. "Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a 
$500.000 treasury bond that would not be 
shown ... [as] margined or collateralized.- 
he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked 
like it was free and clear but it actually 
wasn't," he said. 
Epstein has denied he ever had any deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls 
talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg's direction 
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve 
the missing bonds for a state examination. 
According to Allen, Epstein said, "We'll get 
them back." He had "kind of a flippant atti-
tude," says Allen. "They never came back.- 
 
F
pstein. according to Hoffenberg, also 
came up with a scheme to manipulate 
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at- 
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred 
when Hoffenberg's bid went wrong and the 
share price began to fall. This was alleged to 
have involved multiple clients' accounts con-
trolled by Epstein. 
Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in 
Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case. 
and Epstein. who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of any 
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who 
was handling the suit for the regulators. says 
of Epstein. "He was very elusive.... It was 
hani to really track him down. There were a 
substantial number of checks for significant 
dollars that were paid to him. I remem-
ber.... He was this character we never got a 
handle on. Again we presumed that he was 
involved with the Pan Am and Emery run 
that Hoffenberg made. but we never got a 
chance to depose him:" 
""From the government's discovery in the 
main sentencing against HotTenberg it would 
seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy.-
says David Lewis. who represented Mitchell 
Bracer. "They went for what they knew they 
could get ... and that was the fraudulent 
promissory notes [i.e.. the much larger and 
unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud, based 
in New York State].... What they couldn't 
get. they didn't bother with.- 
Another lawyer involved in the criminal 
prosecution of HotTenberg says. "In a crim-
inal investigation like that. when there is a 
guilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it. 
discovery is always incomplete.... They 
don't have to line up witnesses: they don't 
have to learn every fact that might come out 
on cross-examination." 
pstein was involved with Hoffenberg in 
11.4 other questionable transactions. Finan-
cial records show that in 1988 Epstein in-
vested S1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a 
company that manufactures football helmets. 
Among his co-investors were the theater 
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney 
Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this 
transaction claims that Epstein told Neder-
lander and Toboroff that he had raised his 
share of the money from a Swiss banker, 
344

whose identity they could not be allowed to 
know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the mon-
ey came from him, and Towers's financial 
statements for that year show a loan to Ep-
stein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he 
can't remember the details and has dis-
puted the accuracy of the Towers financial 
reports.) 
Around the same time, Nederlander and 
Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a 
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a 
Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan 
was to group together with two other parties 
to take a substantial declared position in the 
stock. According to a source. Epstein was 
supposed tip help Nederlander and Toboroff 
raise 515 million. He seemed to fail to find 
other investors, say those familiar with the 
deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an in-
vestor.) He invested SI million, which he 
told his co-investors was his own money. 
But in his 1989 deposi-
tion he said that he put 
in only 5300,000 of his 
own money. Where did 
the rest come from? Hof-
fenberg has said it came 
from him. in a loan that 
Nederlander and Toboroff 
didn't know about. 
Two things happened 
that alarmed Nederlander 
and Toboroff. After the 
group signaled a possible 
takeover. the Pennwalt 
management threatened to 
sue the would-be raiders. 
Epstein was reluctant ini-
tially to give a deposition 
about his share of the 
money. telling Toboroff 
there were "reasons" he 
didn't want to. Then. after the opportunity 
for new investors was closed, co-investors 
recall Epstein announcing that he'd found 
one at last: Dick Snider. then C.E.O. of 
the publisher Simon & Schuster. who want-
ed to put up approximately 5500.000. (Nei- 
ther Epstein nor Snyder can now recall 
the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition 
Epstein said that he had recruited Sny-
der. whom he had met socially, into the 
deal.) 
According to a source. Toboroff and Ne-
derlander told Epstein that Snyder was too 
late. but, without their realizing it. Hoffen-
te.rg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to 
Hoffenberg and bought out some of his in-
vestment. But then Snyder wanted out. 
"Nederlander started to get these irate 
calls from [Snyder,] who wasn't part of the 
r, deal, saying he was owed all this money," 
says someone close to the deal. Toboroff 
o and Nederlander were baffled. 
-nitually, a source close to Hoffenberg 
s 	
.!, .Fenbere paid Snyder off. 
J
ust as Nederlander and Toboroff were 
growing wary of Epstein, he became in-
creasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom 
he had met through insurance executive 
Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has 
told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in 
Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence 
by persuading him not to invest in the stock 
market, just as the 1987 crash was approach-
ing. His story has subsequently changed. 
When asked if Wexner knew about his con-
nection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he 
began working for Wexner in 1989, and that 
"it was certainly not the same time." 
Wherever and whenever it was that Ep-
stein and Wexner actually met. there was 
an immediate and strong personal chem-
istry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is "very 
smart with a combination of excellent judg-
ment and unusually high standards. Also, 
he is always a most loyal friend." 
OFFICE SPACE 
The "office" in Epstein's house. It has no 
computers, but it does have a desk that 
Epstein tells people once belonged to banker 
J. P Morgan. and "the lamest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a private home.- 
Sources say Epstein proved that he could 
be useful to Wexner as well. with "fresh" 
ideas about investments. "Wexner had a cou-
ple of bad investments. and Jeffrey cleaned 
those up right away,-  says a former associ-
ate of Epstein's. 
Before he signed on with Wexner. Epstein 
had several meetings with Harold Levin. then 
head of Wexner Investments, in which he 
enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin 
found incomprehensible. "In fact." says some-
one who used to work very closely with Wex-
ner. "almost everyone at the Limited won-
dered who Epstein was: he literally came 
out of nowhere." 
"Everyone was mystified as to what his 
appeal was." says Robert Mornsky. a lbrmer 
vice-chairman of the Limited  
M
uch of Epstein's work is related to clean-
ing up, tightening budgets, and efficien-
cies. One person who worked for Wexner and 
who saw a contract drawn up between the 
two men says Epstein is involved in "every-
thing, not just a little here, a little there. 
Everything!" In addition, he says. "Wexner 
likes having a hatchet man.... Whenever 
there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jef-
frey on it.... He has a reputation for being 
ruthless but he gets the job done." 
Epstein has evidently been asked to fire 
personal-staff members when needed. "He 
was that mysterious person that everyone was 
scared to death of" says a former employee. 
Meanwhile. he is also less than popular 
with some people outside Wexner's company 
with whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' 
himself into the construction process of Les-
lie Wexner's yacht.... That resulted in liti- 
gation down the road between Mr. Wexner 
and the shipyard that 
eventually built the ves-
sel.-  says Lars Forsberg. 
a law:er whose firm at 
he Time. Dickerson and 
P,:.y. was hired to deal 
with litigation stemming 
from the construction 
of Wexner's Limitless—
at 315 feet. one of the 
largest private yachts in 
the world. Et idently. Ep-
stein stalled on paying 
Dickerson and Reily for 
crk "It's probably 
once )1- twice in my le-
gal career that I've had 
to sue a client for payment 
of services that he'd re-
quested and we'd per-
formed ... without issue 
on the performance.-  says Forsberg. In 
the end the matter was settled. but Ep-
stein claims he now has no recollection 
of it. 
The incident is one of a number of disputes 
Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are 
for sums so tiny as to be baffling: for instance. 
Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert 
Glass, who sold him the Palm Beach house in 
1990. for S 13,444—Epstein claimed this was 
owed him for furnishings removed by Glass. 
In 1998 the U.S. Attorney's Office sued 
Epstein for illegally subletting the former 
home of the deputy consul general of Iran 
to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epston

Jeffrey Epstein 
he is winning. Whether in conversations or 
negotiations, he always stands back and lets 
the other person determine the style and 
manner of the conversation or negotiation. 
And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey 
sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick 
a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you 
choose your weapon." 
One case is rather more serious. Currently, 
Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on 
loans from its private-banking arm for $20 
million. Epstein claims that Citibank "fraud-
ulently induced" him into borrowing the 
money for investments. Citibank disputes this 
charge. 
The legal papers for another case offer a 
tare window into Epstein's finances. In 1995. 
Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord, 
the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his 
office in the Ward House. He claimed that 
hey were breaking the terms of the lease by 
Dot letting his staff in at night. The case was 
ventually settled. However, one of the papers 
fled in this dispute is Epstein's financial state-
tient for 1988. in which he claimed to be 
vorth S20 million. He listed that he owned 
S7 million in securities, S 1 million in cash. 
zero in residential property (although he 
told sources that he had already bought the 
home in Palm Beach), and S11 million in 
other assets. including his investment in 
Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: "The 
company had been bought with a huge 
amount of debt. and it wasn't public, so it 
was meaningless to attach a figure like that to 
it ... the price it cost was about 51.2 mil-
lion." The co-investors bought out Epstein's 
share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately 
S3 million. At that time, when Epstein was 
asked. as a routine matter. to sign a paper 
guaranteeing he had access to a few million 
dollars in case of any subsequent disputes 
over the sale price. Wexner signed for him. 
Epstein has explained that this was because 
the co-investors wanted an indemnity against 
being sued by Wexner. One of the investors 
calls this "bullshit." 
E
pstein's appointment to the board of 
New York's Rockefeller University in 
2000 brought him into greater social promi-
nence. Boasting such social names as Nancy 
Kissinger. Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass. 
the board also includes such pre-eminent 
scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Gold-
stein. "Epstein was thrilled to be elected," 
says someone who knows him. 
After one term Epstein resigned. Accord-
ing to New York magazine, this was because 
he didn't like to wear a suit to meetings. A 
Ace::pe:son lb- the Rockefeller board says 
, le t becat:,;e he had insufficient time 
;..):t1%:! member recalls that he  
was "arrogant" and "not a good fit." The 
spokesperson admits that it is "infrequent" 
for board members not to be renominated 
after only one term. 
Still, the recent spate of publicity Ep-
stein has inspired does not seem to have 
fazed him. In November he was spotted in 
the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion 
show at New York's Lexington Avenue Ar- 
mory; around the same time the usual co-
terie of friends and beautiful women were 
whisked off to Little St. James (which he 
tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff) 
for a long weekend. 
Thanks to Epstein's introductions, says 
Martin Nowak. the biologist finds himself 
moving from Princeton to Harvard. where 
he is assuming the joint position of profes-
sor of mathematics and professor of biolo-
gy. Epstein has pledged at least S25 million 
to Harvard to create the Epstein Program 
for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary 
Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office 
at the university. The program will be dedi-
cated to searching for nature's algorithms, a 
pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak's. For 
Epstein this must be the summit of every-
thing he has worked toward: he has been 
seen proudly displaying Harvard president 
Larry Summers's letter of commitment as 
if he can't quite believe it is real. He says he 
was reluctant to have his name attached to 
the program. but Summers persuaded him. 
He rang his mentor Wexner about it. and 
Wexner told him it was all right. 
An insatiable. restless soul. always on the 
move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount 
of downtime into his hectic work schedule. 
Yet there is something almost programmed 
about his relaxation: it's as if even plea-
sure has to be measured in terms of self-
improvement. Nowak says that. when he 
goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean. 
they'll get up at six and, as the sun rises. 
have three-hour conversations about theoret-
ical physics. 'Then he'll go off and do some 
work. re-appear. and we'll talk some more." 
Another person who went to the island 
with Epstein. Maxwell. and several beautiful 
women remembers that the women "sat 
around one night teasing him about the 
kinds of grasping women who might want 
to date him. He was amused by the idea.... 
He's like a king in his own world." 
Many people comment there is some-
thing innocent. almost childlike about Jef-
frey Epstein. They see this as refreshing. given 
the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan 
Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to 
know Epstein. his wife asked him if he would 
still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed 
for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied. 
"Absolutely. I would be as interested in him 
as a friend if we had hamburgers on the 
boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about 
his ideas."

The Fantasist 
Accused of paying underage girls for sex, superrich money manager Jeffrey Epstein is 
finding that living in a dream world is dangerous--even if you can pay for it.

Jeffrey Epstein is under indictment for sex crimes in Palm Beach, Florida, and I'd expected that when he 
came into the office of PR guru Howard Rubenstein, he would be sober and reserved. Quite the 
opposite. He was sparkling and ingenuous, apologizing for the half-hour lateness with a charming line-
-1 never realized how many one-way streets and no-right-turns there are in midtown. I finally got out 
and walked"--and as we went down the corridor to Rubenstein's office, he asked, "Have you managed 
to talk to many of my friends?" Epstein had been supplying me the phone numbers of important 
scientists and financiers and media figures. "Do you understand what an extraordinary group of people

they are, what they have accomplished in their fields?" 
One of the accusers—a girl of 14—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why. His 
walk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened 
qualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone_ Epstein had on 
his signature outfit: new blue jeans and a powder-blue sweater. "I've only ever seen him in jeans," his 
friend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein's 
signal that he doesn't have to wear a uniform like the rest of us. 
I told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic 
delight in every word- "A secretive genius," I'd said. "Not secretive, private," he corrected in his warm 
Brooklyn accent. "And if I was a genius I wouldn't be sitting here." "A guy with sex issues." A smile 
formed on Epstein's bow-shaped lips. "What do you mean by sex issues?" Well ... He was 54, had 
never married—I didn't finish. "Are you channeling my mother?" 
When I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in 
capital letters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein's soul. "It's the Icarus story, 
someone who flies too close to the sun," I said. "Did Icarus like massages?" Epstein asked. 
Two years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they 
came into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and 
soaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his attorney. 
"Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound 
for him; that is why he has had many massages." Epstein had even given $100,000 to Ballet Florida's 
massage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated. 
I never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was 
negotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that 
Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there's 
likely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the power to 
dar7le and, though accused of "doing everything in Sodwn and Gomorrah." as one friend put it, seemed 
to believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn't the least hit tawdry .  
"He lives in a different environment," says Siegal_ "He's of this world. But he creates this different 
environment lie lives like a pasha. I he most magnificent townhouse I've ever been in, and I've been in 
everything. I've seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the 
Caribbean—it is not to be believed. I've seen photographs of the apartment in Paris How did he get 
himself into that pickle? Mats the mystery of Jeffry Epstein. 1 ie's very mysterious. Not that many 
people get close to him. Not that many people know him."

of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein's rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house; 
Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein's forte was dealing with wealthier 
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of LimitedBrands, reportedly 
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no 
footman; he loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who 
could show the rich how to live with their money. "I want people to understand the power, the 
responsibility, and the burden of their money," he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. "I 
think it's all done with mirrors," says Michael Stroll, a Chicago business-man who sued Epstein (and 
lost) when an oil deal didn't work out. 
Next: Epstein's Icarus moment. 
The New York Timm 
Redux) 
Stroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. "Everybody who's his friend thinks he's so 
darn brilliant because he's so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, I never saw him work. Anybody I 
know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day." 
Those who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. "His mind 
goes through a cross section of descriptions," says Joe Pagano, a financier. "He can go from 
mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct 
answer in the shortest period of time. That's my definition of IQ." 
A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. "He has the ability to 
make connections that other minds can't make," says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. "He is 
extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also 
to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have He also has an 
extremely short attention span. Why?—it's not that he's bored. He has enough information after fifteen

minutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert's 
statements." 
Epstein has been a munificent supporter of cutting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early 
biotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the 
late nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference 
on the West Coast in his beautiful 727. 
"It was all a little giddy," Wolff says. "There's a little food out, lovely hors d'oeuvre. And then after 
fifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he 
had a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual attire. Jeans, no socks, 
loafers, a button-down shirt, shirttails out. And he was followed onto the plane by—how shall I say 
this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, 18, 19, 20, who 
knows? They were model-like. They towered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things. 
You didn't know what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very 
tall girls?" 
Soon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 71st Street. He understood that there was a 
purpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. "What does the 
media mean, where does he fit into it?" Then Epstein began to show up in the press. In 2002, he flew 
Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being 
written about. In 2003, be became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was 
involved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his 
office at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. "His 
literal office is where Bennett Cerf's was. It's an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at 
all. It's almost European_ It's old— old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way." Nearby, Wolff went on, "the 
trading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They're like a throwback, a 
bunch of guys from the fillies. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and 
a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say 'What's 
going on here?' and he gives you that Cheshire smile." 
Epstein likes to say he's private, but you don't fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting attention. One 
friend says the Africa trip was Epstein's Icarus moment_ There was tremendous risk that the natural 
forces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends' theory 
of the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief battened onto a rich man because he was not living 
in a box like everyone else. 
The dazzling arc of Epstein's comet came to an end—without his knowing it—in March 2005. That was 
when a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name, 
said that she believed her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The 
stepmother had learned about the matter in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an 
"involuntary-admitted juvenile educational facility" because of behavior problems. She had shown up at 
the school with $300 in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a 
"whore," another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a 
call from another student's mother_ Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present_ 
The girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic 
Intracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of 
25 who wasn't very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in, 
naked but for a towel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he 
touched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.

Next: The police lock onto Epstein's sybaritic lifestyle. 
The lengthy police narrative in the case doesn't make clear how police connected gray-haired Jeff with 
Jeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw 
themselves into an investigation of the modern and palatial house on El Brillo Way. 
Palm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for towering ficus privacy hedges on 
Mediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the 
police did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach, 
where, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein's house. The 14-
year-old was used to set up her 18-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once 
and thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $200 a head. "I'm like Heidi Fleiss." she said. 
The police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer 
parks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls, 
who said they could make $200 by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her 
the younger the better—which she said meant 18 to 20. The rules were simple. Tell him you're 18. 
There might be some touching; you could draw the line. "The more you do, the more you are paid." A 
couple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 50 times, 
another hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-19-year-old 
beauty who Epstein told one of them was his "sex slave"; he'd purchased her from her family back in 
Yugoslavia. 
Epstein's friends' belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto 
Epstein's sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls' thong panties, the shape and color of 
the sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the 
statue of the man with a bow. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an 
eye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner's plane, noting the procession of Cadillac 
Escalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein, 
through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York 
decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized 
a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-
shaped soaps. 
Those soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn't see his sex life as tawdry, wasn't 
hiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from "a deep and 
basic cultural moment" once epitomized by Hugh Heftier. "Jeffrey is living a life that once might have 
been prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed I think the culture has outgrown it. 
You can't describe it without being held to severe account. It's not allowed. It may be allowed if you're 
secretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an 
achievement to Jeffrey." 
Some girls who "worked" for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who 
allegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was "so in love 
with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him." Two college girls/aspiring models were matter-of-
fact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house. 
But generally the girls' feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from. disgust to fear. Epstein 
was the hairy troll under the bridge they bad to pass over to get quick money. One girl "stated she was 
very uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over." Another kept looking at the clock, 
and Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They 
didn't like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn't want it inside them. Some couldn't say just what

Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they 
talked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was "powerful" and was 
afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in 
which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to 
model the underwear he'd bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was 
so upset by Epstein's removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship 
with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein "a pervert." 
Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly 
and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom 
was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with 
sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein's love shack was like 
Hugh Hefner's. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge porn is 
men with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-school cheerleaders or college girls on break, 
and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52, 
Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and 
Coeds Need Cash but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that 
his activities would result in a police investigation. 
His claim that he'd given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. "The 
massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It's part of a dancer's life to have daily 
massages," says the ballet's marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein's generosities 
preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue 
masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy 
endings. 
Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation. 
The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The 
law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein's girls 
might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it's difficult to believe Epstein 
wouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying 
that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered 
whatever they wanted from Epstein's chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told 
police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could 
happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss's direction, he brought a pail of 
roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama. 
"He has never been secretive about the girls," Wolff says. "At one point, when his troubles began, he 
was talking to me and said, 'What can i say, I like young girls.' I said, 'Maybe you should say, 'I like 
young women.' " 
Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein's friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Jaw 
professor, provided the police and the state attorney's office with a dossier on a couple of the victims 
gleaned from their MySpace sites 	
showing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police 
complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to 
appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say, 
"Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with." 
By then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the

waterway to the Palm Beach County state attorney's office, hut the state attorney apparently saw the 
main witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on 
MySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria's Secret. The police wanted numerous 
felony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they 
heard that the state attorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and 
sending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state attorney of 
bending over backward for a rich man and then turned the matter over to the FBI. 
Finally, in July 2006, the Palm Beach County state attorney's office handed down one indictment of 
Epstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment. 
Reiter was enraged. He released a letter he had sent out to five underage girls that read "I do not feel that 
justice has been sufficiently served." 
Epstein's lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S. 
Attorney's office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the 
former Clinton prosecutor. 
One of Epstein's friends told me, "He thinks there's an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm 
Beach. He's convinced of that. Maybe it's a defense mechanism." Palm Beach was historically a bastion 
of Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the 
public fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems 
stuck in the time of the Gentlemen's Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I 
asked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple 
Emanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. "There's no way, 
shape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes. 
And there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew." Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues 
from opening. There are now four on the little island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast 
founder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, "Half, 
 rny-q,o. 
sources on the island are Jewish socialites." n u

Lambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have to /W 11-4)

Maybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein's two big

Israel supporters. Dershowitz has written a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Now throw

Of course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from je not ,) k 
Edgar Allan Poe's psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth's sociological comedies. Epstein is 
licensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon 	
he has a Glock—and a shower on the first floor was 
given over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had 
a Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Now he was licensed 
in the Virgin Islands and gave his "permanent residence" as the same address as Island Yachts. 
Notwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and 
joyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the 
sensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.

Next: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong. 
The police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had 
had a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the 
daughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died 
mysteriously off his yacht in 1991. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father 
and that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas 
says he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house, 
and the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was 
five years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never showed up in all the surveillance. 
only her stationery. 
Epstein's activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told 
police that toward the end of his employment, the girls were "younger and younger," and he often had to 
wash off vibrators and "a long rubber penis" left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, 
said that he found the sex toys he had to wash "scattered on the floor."

No need to worry about dirty laundry, if there's someone to do it.

The U.S. attorney's investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would 
be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein 
will not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state attorney on the prostitution charge. 
Not that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong_ Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the 
air that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endowed him with utter 
shamelessness, the emperor's new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the 
moral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the 
social contract was not made in good faith. Epstein's friends say that on this matter, he has a 
philosophical position. 
"Fundamentally," Wolff says, "it's about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich 
get richer. And then at. some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey's point is that this 
whole issue is—it's just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more 
successful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater 
the discrepancy actually is." 
There is no better place to observe how Epstein's mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of 
life are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from 
Bulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls 
came from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters, 
and pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson's house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch. 
An attractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams 
it. "We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case." 
Driving home with their $500, Haley said to the 14-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd 
be rich, and it's understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest 
stories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman's wife, 
said she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation 
with him. He made it clear that he did "not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm 
Beach." One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.

"In my mind, I'm like, 'Oh my God, when this is over you're getting so much money." 
Jose Lambiet says the ease went forward in Palm Beach despite the efforts of the dream team because of 
community rage arising from the class issues in the case—Epstein found the girls not from his own 
fancy neighborhood but from the struggling suburbs. 
He has never shown a glimmer of understanding that a high-school girl could be damaged by a powerful 
50-year-old's demands, or that some of the girls were already emotionally damaged. For someone who 
could dream anything, it seems a little small.

n Manhattan's 
Upper Eat Side. home to some of the 
most expensive real estate on earth, exists 
the crown jewel of the city's residential 
town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, 
huge arched windows, and nine floors, it 
sits on—or, rather. commands—the block 
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison 
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro-
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors, it seems more like an institution than 
a house. This is perhaps not surprising—
until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private 
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's 
largest private residence. 
Inside. amid the flurry of menservants 
attired in sober black suits and pristine 
white gloves. you feel yod have stumbled 
into someone's private Xanadu. This is 
no mere rich person's home. but a high-
walled. eclectic. imperious fantasy that 
seems to have no boundaries. 
The entrance hall is decorated not with 
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eyeballs: these, the owner 
tells people with relish, were imported from 
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, 
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly 
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any 
case. guests are like pygmies next to the 
nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked 
African warrior. 
Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal. the statement of someone 
who wants to be known for the scale of his 
possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey 
Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it 
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren. 
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered 
face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts, 
and loafers. He tells people he bought the 
house because he knew he "could never live 
anywhere bigger." He thinks 51,000 square 
feet is an appropriately large space for some-
one like himself, who deals mostly in large 
concepts—especially large sums of money. 
Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at 
the town house—Epstein usually refers to the 
former as "tea," since he likes to eat bite- 
size morsels and drink copious quantities of 
Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or to- 
bacco.) Tea is served in the "leather room," 
so called because of the cordovan-colored 
fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered 
in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a 
huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding 
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling li-
onskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger 
sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and 
guests by the menservants in white gloves. 
Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the "office." an enormous gallery 
spanning the width of the house. Strangely, 
it holds no computer. Computers belong in 
the "computer room" (a smaller room at 
the back of the house). Epstein has been 
known to say. The office features a gilded 
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged 
to banker J. P. Morgan). 18th-century black 
lacquered Portuguese cabinets. and a nine-
foot ebony Steinway ''D" grand. On the 
desk. a paperback copy of the Marquis de 
Sade's The Misfiirtunes of iinue was re-
cently spotted. Covering the t1‘.,or. Epstein 
has explained. "is the largest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a private home—so big. it 
must have come from a mosque." Amid 
such splendor, much of which reflects the 
work of the French decorator Alberto Pin-
to. who has worked for Jacques Chirac and 
the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Ara-
bia, there is one particularly startling oddi-
ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop 
the grand piano. "No decorator would ever 
tell you to do that." Epstein brags to visi-
tors. "But I want people to think what it 
means to stuff a dog." People can't help 
but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he 
always has the last word. 
In addition to the town house. Epstein 
lives in what is reputed to be the largest 
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an S18 
million. 7.500-acre ranch which he named 
"Zorro.-  "It makes the town house look like 
a shack.-  Epstein has said. He also owns 
Little St. James. a 70-acre island in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. where the main house 
is currently being renovated by Edward Tut-
tle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is 
also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, 
Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream 
IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing '27. replete 
with trading room. on which Epstein re-
cently flew President Clinton. actors Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket 
magnate Ron Burkle. Lew Wasserman's 
grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few oth-
ers, on a mission to explore the problems of 
AIDS and economic development in Africa. 
Epstein is charming, but he doesn't let  
the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely 
and calculating, giving some hint at the 
steady whir of machinery running behind 
them. "Let's play chess," he said to me, af-
ter refusing to give an interview for this arti-
cle. "You be white. You get the first move." 
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man 
who seems to feel he can win no matter 
what the advantage of the other side. His 
advantage is that no one really seems to 
know him or his history completely or what 
his arsenal actually consists of. He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one 
of the few truly baffling mysteries among 
New York's moneyed world. People know 
snippets, but few know the whole. 
"He's very enigmatic.-  says Rosa Monck-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in 
the U.K. and a close friend since the early 
1980s. "You think you know him and then 
you peel off another ring of the onion skin 
and there's something else extraordinary 
underneath. He never reveals his hand.... 
He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not 
what you get.- 
ven acquaintances sense a 
curious dichotomy: Nes. he 
lives like a "modern ma-
haraja.-  as Leah Kiernan. 
one of his art dealers. puts 
it. Yet he is fastidiously, al-
most obsessively private—he 
lists himself in the phone book under a 
pseudonym. He rarely attends society gath-
erings or weddings or funerals: he considers 
eating in restaurants like "eating on the sub-
way--i.e., something he'd never do. There 
are many women in his life_ mostly young, 
but there is no one of them to whom he 
has been able to commit. He describes his 
most public companion of the last decade, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 41. the daughter of the 
late, disgraced media baron Robert Max-
well, as simply his "best friend." He says 
she is not on his payroll, but she seems 
to organize much of his life—recently she 
was making telephone inquiries to find a 
California-based yoga instructor for him. 
(Epstein is still close to his two other long-
term girlfriends. Paula Heil Fisher. a for-
mer associate of his at the brokerage firm 
Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, 
and Eva Andersson Dubin. a doctor and 
onetime model. He tells people that when 
a relationship is over the girlfriend "moves 
up. not down.-  to friendship status.) 
Some of the businessmen who dine with 
him at his home—they include newspaper 
publisher Mort Zuckerman. banker Louis 
Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, 
real-estate tycoon Leon Black. former Mi-
crosoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom 
Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels). and real-estate

personality Donald Trump—sometimes 
seem not all that clear as to what he ac-
tually does to earn his millions. Certainly, 
you won't find Epstein's transactions writ-
ten about on Bloomberg or talked about in 
the trading moms. "The trading desks don't 
seem to know him. It's unusual for animals 
that big not to leave any footprints in the 
snow," says a high-level investment manager. 
Unlike such fund managers as George 
Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose 
client lists and stock maneuverings act as 
their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his 
deals and clients secret, bar one client: bil-
lionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chair-
man of Limited Brtnds. Epstein insists that 
ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he 
has managed money only for billionaires—
who depend on him for discretion. "I was 
the only person crazy enough, or 
arrogant enough. or misplaced 
enough, to make my limit a bil-
lion dollars or more," he tells peo-
ple freely. According to him, the 
flat fees he receives from his clients, 
combined with his skill at playing 
the currency markets "with very 
large sums of money," have afforded 
him the lifestyle he enjoys today. 
Why do billionaires choose him 
as their trustee? Because the prob-
lems of the mega-rich. he tells peo-
ple. are different from yours and 
mine. and his unique philosophy is 
central to understanding those problems: 
-Very few people need any more money 
when they have a billion dollars. The key 
is not to have it do harm more than any-
thing else.... You don't want to lose your 
money.- 
1 
	
e has likened his job to 
that of an architect—more 
specifically, one who spe-
cializes in remodeling: "I 
always describe [a billion-
aire] as someone who 
started out in a small 
home and as he became wealthier had add-
ons. He added on another addition, he built 
a mom over the garage ... until you have a 
house that is usually a mess.... It's a large 
house that has been put together over time 
where no one could foretell the financial fu-
ture and their accompanying needs." 
He makes it sound as though his job 
combines the roles of real-estate agent, ac-
countant, lawyer, money manager, trustee, 
and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, 
myths and rumor swirl around Epstein. 
Here are some of the hard facts about 
Epstein—ones that he doesn't mind people 
knowing: He—grew-
--up- middle-class in 
Brooklyn. His father worked for the city's  
parks department. His 
parents viewed educa-
tion as "the N‘ay out" 
for him and his young- 
er brother. Mark. now 
working in real estate. 
Jeffrey started to play 
the piano—for which he 
maintains a passion—at 
five, and he went to 
Brooklyn's Lafayette High 
School. He was good at 
mathematics. and in his 
early 20s he got a job teaching physics and 
math at Dalton. the elite Manhattan pri-
vate school. While there he began tutoring 
the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace 
Greenberg and was friendly with a daugh-
ter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear 
Stearns. where, under the mentorship of 
both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns 
C.E.O. James Cayne. he did well enough 
to become a limited partner—a rung be-
neath full partner. He abruptly departed in 
1981 because, he has said, he wanted to 
run his own business. 
Thereafter the details recede into shad-
ow. A few of the handful of current friends 
who have known him since the early 1980s 
recall that he used to tell them he was a

For the last 15 years, he's been running his

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his 
life—Epstein has said this was in 1986: 
others say it was in 1989, at the earliest—
he has gradually, in a way that has not 
generally maize headlines, come to be ac-
cepted by the Establishment. He's a mem-
ber of various commissions and councils: 
he is on the Trilateral Commission, the 
Council on Foreign Relations, the New 
York Academy of Sciences, and the Insti-
tute of International Education. 
His current fan club extends to Cayne.

SPOILS OF SUCCESS 
From top: Epstein's 70-
acre island. Little St. 
James. in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands—he now calls 
it Little St. Jeff: Epstein 
with President Clinton in 
Brunei. 2002: Leslie 
Wexner with his future 
wife, Abigail. at the 1990 
C.F.D.A. Fashion Awards. 
in New York. 1991. 
Larry Summers. Harvard's current presi-
dent. Harvard law professor Alan Dersho-
witz says, "I'm on my 20th book.... The 
only person outside of my immediate family 
that I send drafts to is Jeffrey." Real-estate 
developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose. 
who has worked with Epstein on projects in 
New Albany. Ohio. for Wexner. says. "He 
digests and decodes the information very 
rapidly, which is to me terrific because we 
have shorter meetings." 
Also on the list of admirers are former 
senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of 
distinguished scientists, most of whom 
Epstein has helped fund in recent years. 
They include Nobel Prize winners Gerald  
Edelman and Murray Gell- 
Mann. and mathematical 
biologist Martin Nowak. 
When these men describe 
Epstein, they talk about 
"energy" and -curiosity." as 
well as a lore for theoreti-
cal physics that they don't 
ordinarily find in laymen. 
Gell-Mann rather sweetly 
mentions that "there are al-
ways pretty ladies around" 
when he goes to dinner chef 
Epstein, and he's under the impression that 
Epstein's clients include the Queen of En-
gland. Both Nowak and Dershowitz were 
thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand 
of a man named -Andrew" in Epstein's 
house. "Andrew" turned out to be Prince 
Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit 
in the back of Dershowitz's law class. 
Epstein gets annoyed when anyone sug-
gests that Wexner "made him." "I had real-
ly rich clients before." he has said. Yet he 
does not deny that he and Wexner have a 
special relationship. Epstein sees it as a 
partnership of equals. "People have said it's 
like we have one brain between two of us: 
each has a side." 
"I think we both possess the skill of 
seeing patterns," says Wexner. "But Jef-
frey sees patterns in politics and finan-
cial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle 
and fashion trends. My skills are not in in-
vestment strategy, and, as everyone who 
knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fash-
ion and design. We frequently discuss 
world trends as each of us sees them." 
y the time Epstein met 
Wexner, the latter was a 
retail legend who had 
built a 53 billion em-
pire—one that now in-
cludes Victoria's Secret, 
Express. and Bath & 
Body Works—from S5.000 lent him by his 
aunt. "Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of 
person who had the potential to real-
ize his [Jeffrey's] dreams." says some-
one who has worked closely with 
both men. "He gave Jeffrey the ball. 
and Jeffrey hit it out of the park." 
Wexner. through a trust. bought 
the town house in which Epstein 
now lives for a reported S13.2 
million in 1989. In 1993. Wex-
ner married Abigail Koppel. 
a 31-year-old lawyer. and the 
newlyweds relocated to Ohio: 
in 1996, Epstein moved in- 
to the town house. Public 
documents suggest that the house 
is still owned by the trust that bought it. 
but Epstein has said that he now owns the 
house. 
Wexner trusts Epstein so completely 
that he has assigned him the power of fidu-
ciary over all of his private trusts and foun-
dations. says a source close to Wexner. In 
1992. Epstein even persuaded Wexner to 
put him on the board of the Wexner Foun-
dation in place of Wexner's ailing mother. 
Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to 
be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled 
by splitting the foundation in two. 
Epstein does not care that he comes be-
tween family members. In fact. he sees it 
as his job. He tells people. "I am there to 
represent my client. and if my client needs 
protecting—sometimes even from his own 
family—then it's often better that people 
hate me, not the client." 
"You've probably heard I'm vicious in 
my representation of my clients." he tells 
people proudly: Leah Kiernan describes his 
haggling over art prices as something like 
a scene out of the movie Mad Max: Be-
yond Munderdome. Even a former mentor 
says he's seen "the dark side" of Epstein. 
and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meet-
ing in which Epstein chewed out a team 
making a presentation for Wexner as

being so brutal as to be "irresponsible." 
One reporter, in fact, received three threats 
from Epstein while preparing a piece. They 
were delivered in a jocular tone, but the 
message was clear: There will be trouble 
for your family if I don't like the article. 
On the other hand, Epstein is clearly 
very generous with friends. Joe Pagano. an 
Aspen-based venture capitalist, who has 
known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns 
days. can't say enough nice things: "I have 
a boy who's dyslexic. and Jeffrey's gotten 
close to him over the years.... Jeffrey got 
him into music. He bought him his first 
piano. And then as he got to school he had 
difficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got 
him interested in taking flying lessons." 
Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling 
her that her, daughter. Domenica, who suf-
fers from Down syndrome. needed the sun. 
and that Rosa should feel free to bring her 
to his house in Palm Beach anytime. 
Some friends remember that in the late 
80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the air-
line tickets of good friends by affixing first-
class stickers: the only problem was that the 
stickers turned out to be unofficial. Some-
times the technique worked. but other times 
it didn't, and the um% thing recipients found 
themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has 
claimed that he paid for the upgrades, and 
had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of 
those who benefited from Epstein's largesse 
claim that his generosity comes with no 
strings attached, "1 never felt he wanted 
anything from me in return." says one old 
friend. who received a first-class upgrade. 
y
pstein is known about town 
as a man who loves wom-
en—lots of them. mostly 
young. Model types have 
been heard saying they are 
full of gratitude to Epstein 
for flying them around, and 
he is a familiar face to many of the Victo-
ria's Secret girls. One young woman recalls 
being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to 
a concert at Epstein's town house. where 
the women seemed to outnumber the men 
by far. "These were not women you'd see 
at Upper East Side dinners." the woman 
recalls. "Many seemed foreign and dressed 
a little bizarrely." This same guest also at-
tended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell 
that Prince Andrew attended, which was 
tilled, she says, with young Russian mod-
els. "Some of the guests were horrified,-
the woman says. 
"He's reckless,-  says a former business 
associate, "and he's gotten more so. Mon-
ey does that to you. He's breaking the oath 
he made to himself—that he would never 
do anything that would expose him in the  
media. Right now, in the wake of the pub-
licity following his trip with Clinton, he 
must be in a very difficult place." 
A
ccording to S.E.C. and 
other legal documents un-
earthed by Vanity Fair, 
Epstein may have good 
reason to keep his past 
cloaked in secrecy: his real 
mentor, it might seem, was 
not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffen-
berg, 57, who, for a few months before the 
S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993. was 
trying to buy the New York Post. He is cur-
rently incarcerated in the Federal Medical 
Center in Devens. Massachusetts. serving a 
20-year sentence for bilking investors out of 
more than 5450 million in one of the lamest 
Ponzi schemes in American history. 
When Epstein met Hoffenberg in Lon-
don in the 1980s. the latter was the char-
ismatic. audacious head of the Towers 
Financial Corporation. a collection agency 
that was supposed to buy debts that peo-
ple owed to hospitals. banks. and phone 
companies. But Hoffenberg began using 
company funds to pay off earlier investors 
and service a lavish lifestyle that included a 
mansion on Lone Island. homes on Man-
hattan's Sutton Place and in Florida. and a 
fleet of cars and planes. 
Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in 
common. Both were smart and obsessed 
with making money. Both were from Brook-
!) n. According to Hoffenberg. the two men 
were introduced by Douglas Leese. a de-
fense contractor. Epstein has said the were 
introduced by John Mitchell. the late attor-
ney general. 
Epstein had been running International 
Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.). a consulting 
company. out of his apartment in the Solo 
building on East 66th Street in New Nbrk. 
Though he has claimed that he managed 
money for billionaires only, in a 1089 dep-
osition he testified that he spent 8) per-
cent of his time helping people recover 
stolen money from fraudulent brokers and 
lawyers. He was also not above entering 
into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals 
with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that 
Michael Stroll, the former head of Wil-
liams Electronics Inc.. filed against Epstein 
shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an in- 
vestment from Stroll of 5450.000. which 
Epstein put into oil. In 1984. Stroll asked 
for his money back: four years later he had 
received only 510.000. Stroll lost the suit. 
after Epstein claimed in court, among oth-
er things, that the check for S10,000 was for 
a horse he'd bought from Stroll. "My net 
worth never exceeded four and a half mil-
lion dollars.-  Stroll has said. 
Hoffenberg, says a close friend, "really 
liked Jeffrey.... Jeffrey has a way of getting 
under your skin, and he was under Hof-
fenberg's." Also appealing to Hoffenberg 
were Epstein's social connections; they in-
cluded oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the 
designer Vera) and Mohan Mutjani, whose 
clothing company grew into Gloria Van-
derbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even then. 
One friend recalls that when he took Cana-
dian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he 
hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the oc-
casion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.) 
In 1987. Hoffenberz, according to sources. 
set Epstein up in the offices he still occu-
pies in the Villard House. on Madison Av-
enue. across a courtyard from the restaurant 
Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new pro-
tégé as a consultant at S25.000 a month. 
and the relationship flourished. "They trav-
eled everywheie together—on HotTenberg's 
plane. all around the world, they were al-
ways together,-  says a source. Hoffenberg 
has claimed that Epstein confided in him. 
saying. for example. that he had left Bear 
Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered ex-
ecuting "illegal operations." 
Several of Epstein's L.:ar Stearns contem-
poraries recall that Epstein left the compa-
ny very suddenly. Within the company there 
were rumors also that he was involved in a 
technical infringement. and it was thought 
that the executive committee asked that he 
resign after his two supporters. Ace Green-
berg and Jimmy Cayne. were outnumbered. 
Greenberg says he can't recall this: Clyne 
denies it happened. and Epstein has de-
nied it as well. -.1effre Epstein left Bear 
Stearns of his own volition.-  says Clyne. 
"It was never suggested that he leave by 
any member of management. and manage-
ment never looked into any improprieties 
by him. Jeffrey said specifically. 'I don't 
want to work for anybody else. I want to 
work for myself.'" Vet. this is not the story 
that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and 
to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a 
civil business case in Philadelphia. 
In 1981 the S.E.C.'s Jonathan Harris and 
Robert Blackburn took Epstein's testimony 
and that of other Bear Stearns employees in 
part of what became a protracted case 
about insider trading around a tender otTer 
placed on March 11, 1981. by the Seagram 
Company Lid. for St. Joe Minerals Corp. 
Ultimately several Italian and Swiss in-
vestors were found guilty, including Italian 
financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used 
his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar 
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about 
the tender offer. 
After the tender offer was announced.

mon making Good Will Hunting II, Aft' leek 
says to Damon, "What do I keep telling you? 
You gotta do the safe picture, then you do 
the art picture. Then sometimes you gotta 
do the payback picture because your friend 
says you owe him. Then sometimes you got-
ta go back to the well." 
"Sometimes you do Reindeer Games," 
Damon says derisively. 
"That's just mean," Affleck whines. 
But it's a pretty accurate description of 
his career to date. "Ben takes these franchise 
properties so he can go and experiment," 
says Harvey Weinstein. 
"He believes in trying to stretch himself 
and notl keep doing the same thing," ob-
serves Bruce Willis. who starred with Affleck 
in Armageddon. "He's an awesome actor, 
and I think he's going to do great things." 
Several years ago, in a televised interview 
on Inside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that 
his mai was to make big commercial movies. 
He has since revised his ambitions. "That's 
an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd 
rather be in movies like Magnolia, which I 
think is a towering achievement. I'll con-
tinue to act. but I won't act in a way that 
requires me to hang my name out there 
and do a lot of publicity. I'll do character 
roles and focus on writing and directing. It 
doesn't require the same kinds of sacri-
fice. in terms of quality of life and person-
al life. and it's a more holistic approach to 
the process. It's become increasingly frus-
trating for me to have my role in the story-
telling process limited to one character. You 
have to be respectful and judicious about  
your input when it's somebody else's project." 
Affleck has always impressed colleagues 
with his voracious appetite for information 
and skills. "He has made it a point to learn 
everything he can about how the business 
works—not just the craft of acting, but 
from the producing standpoint, from the 
studio standpoint," says Jon Gordon, exec-
utive vice president of production at Mira-
max. "He knows how deals work. It's what 
sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio 
at some point. he could. He's about as 
sharp as they come." 
A
ffleck is already juggling his acting with 
screenwriting and such other commit-
ments as Project Greenlieht. the contest he 
and Damon started to help launch the ca-
reers of young filmmakers. Atileck's friends 
are certain he'll be directing soon. "There's 
no question," Weinstein says. "Both he and 
Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the 
rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll 
be home runs in both instances." 
But there are other thoughts tickling the 
back of Affleck's mind as well. A passion-
ate liberal. he campaign-2d for Al Gore, 
cares deeply about pekcal issues. and is 
extremely well informed. He entertains him-
self by writing imaginary political speeches 
in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS 
in Africa than his movie career. 
When Lopez goes to Atfleck's mother's 
house for dinner. Weinstein reports. "J.Lo 
told me that the conversation at the table is 
always about politics—about government 
initiathes. educational initiatives. what's go-
ing on in the day." 
So is Affleck planning to re:ome the lib-

running for Congress, at least: "I think there's 
a real nobility to public service. It would be 
fun to run on a platform I really be: ed 
in, without any of the kind of comproi,. rs 
people make—without being beholden • 
the win-at-all-costs mentality." 
And the invasion of privacy would h.: 
nothing new. "What are you going to say 
about me that hasn't already been said? I 
don't cheat. I don't drink, I don't do drugs. 
I live a clean life," Affleck says, his eyes 
twinkling. 
"He's only 30 years old." says Jennifer 
Todd. who co-produced Boiler Room. "He 
still has an enormous amount of time to 
do thines." 
Time, and drive. "I think he's incredibly 
hungry." says Sean Bailey. who founded 
the media and production company Live-
Planet with Affleck. Damon, and Chris 
Moore. "I think the euy has very grand 
aspirations. I don't think he's eoing to be 
content with just being a movie star. He 
knows he has the potential to do very big 
things." 
Such ambitions could he derailed by any 
number of miscalculations. including a pri-
vate life that generates too many sensational 
headlines. but Affleck has a clear idea of 
the ultimate goal. "On my deathbed. I have 
to be one who looks back and feels I lived 
a good and substantial and meaningful 
life." he says. 
In the meantime. hot- Sr. there's a wed-
ding to plan. = 
Jeffrey Epstein 
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 305 Bear Stearns 
and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear 
Steams on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped 
off that Epstein had information on insider 
trading at Bear Stearns. and it was therefore 
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testi-
mony. given on April 1. 1981, Epstein claimed 
that he had found "offensive" the way Bear 
Stearns management had handled a disci-
plinary action following its discovery that he 
had committed a possible "Reg D" viola-
tion—evidently he had lent money to his clos-
est friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said 
that he'd lent approximately $20.000 to War-
ren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action 
could have been considered improper, al-
though Epstein claimed he had not realized 
this until afterward. 
According to Epstein, Bear Stearns man-
agement had questioned him about the loan 
around March 4. The questioners, Epstein 
said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and  
Alvin Einbender. in his 1989 deposition Ep-
stein recalled that the partner who had made 
an ' issue" of the matter was Marvin David-
son. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met 
with Tarnopol and Einbender again. and the 
two partners told him that the executive com-
mittee had weighed the offense. toeether with 
previous -carelessness-  over expenses. and 
he would be fined S2.500. 
"There was discussion whether, in fact, I 
had ever put in an airline ticket for some-
one else and not myself and I said that it 
was possible, ... since my secretary han-
dles my expenses.-  Epstein told the S.E.C. 
In his 1989 testimony he stated that the 
"Reg D" incident had cost him a shot at 
partnership that year. 
What the S.E.C. seemed to he especially 
interested in was whether there was a con-
nection between Epstein's leaving and the 
alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals 
by other people at Bear Stearns: 
Q: Sir. are you aware that certain rumors may 
have been circulating around your firm in con- 
nection with your reasons for leaving the firm? 
A: I'm aware that there were many rumors. 
Q: What were the rumors you heard? 
A: Nothing to do with St. Joe. 
Q: Can you relate what you heard? 
A: It was having to do with an illicit affair 
with a secretary. 
Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggest-
ing that you had made a presentation or com-
munication to the Executive Committee con-
cerning alleged improprieties by other mem-
bers or employees of Bear Stearns? 
A: I, in fact. have heard that rumor. but it's been 
from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week. 
Q: Have you heard it from anyone else? 
A: No. 
A little later the interview focuses on 
James Cayne: 
Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear 
Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or iv- 
sider information in connection with St ' • 
Minerals Corporation? 
A: No. 
Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation 
with you about St. Joe Minerals? 
A: No. 
Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversa-

tions between Mr. Cayne and anyone else re- 
garding St. Joe Minerals? 
A: No. 
And still later in the questioning comes this 
exchange: 
Q: Have you had any type of business deal-
ings with Mr. Cayne? 
A: There's no relationship with Bear Stearns. 
Q: Pardon? 
A: Other than Bear Steams. no. 
Q: Have you been a participant in any type of 
business venture with Mr. Cayne? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you have any expectation of participat-
ing iniany business venture with Mr. Cayne? 
A: No. 
Q: Have you had any business participations 
with Mr. Theram? 
A: No; nor do I anticipate any. 
Q: Mr. Epstein. did anyone at Bear Stearns 
tell you in words or substance that you should 
not divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to 
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission? 
A: No. 
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way. 
either directly or indirectly. in words or sub-
stance. that your compensation for this past 
year or any future monies coming to you from 
Bear Stearns will be contingent upon our not 
divulging information to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission? 
A: No. 
Despite the circumstances of Epstein's 
leaving, Bear Steams agreed to pay him his 
annual bonus—which he anticipated as be-
ing approximately S100.000. 
The S.E.C. never brought any charges 
against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider 
trading in St. Joe. but its questioning seems 
to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's 
answers. Some sources have wondered 
why, if he was such a big producer at Bear 
Stearns. he would have given it up over a 
mere $2,500 tine. 
Certainly the years after Epstein left the 
firm were not obviously prosperous ones. 
His luck didn't seem to change until he met 
Hoffenberg. 
nne of Epstein's first assignments for Hof- 
fenberg was to mastermind doomed bids 
to take over Pan American World Airways in 
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. 
Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before 
a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up 
with the idea of financing these bids through 
Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois 
insurance companies, Associated Life and 
United Fire. "He was hired by us to work on 
the securities side of the insurance companies 
and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a 
profit for us and for the companies.-  Hoffen-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also 
alleged that Epstein %,..!s the "technician." ex- 
ecuting the schemes, although, having no 
broker's license, he had to rely on others to 
make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg's sub- 
sequent testimony in his criminal case has 
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed 
he was merely asked how the bids could be 
accomplished and has said he had nothing 
to do with the financing of them. Yet Rich- 
ard Allen, the former treasurer of United 
Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three 
times at the company. He and another ex- 
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finances. And in his deposition 
of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one 
who executed "all" Hoffenberg's instructions 
to buy and sell the stock. He called it "mak-
ing the orders." He could not recall whether 
he had chosen the brokers used. 
To win approval from the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Towers's acquisition of 
the companies, Hoffenberg promised to in-
ject S3 million of new capital into them. In 
fact, in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg 
claimed that he. his chief operating officer. 
Mitchell Brater. and Epstein came up with a 
scheme to steal S3 million of the insurance 
companies' bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock. "Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater 
arranged the various brokerage accounts for 
the bonds to be placed with in New York. 
and I think one in Chicago. Rodman & Ren-
shaw." Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then. 
said Hoffenberg. while making it appear as 
though they were investing the bonds in 
much safer financial instruments. they used 
them as collateral to buy the stock. "Ep-
stein was the person in charge of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Brater was assisting 
him with it ill coordination on behalf of the 
insurance companies' money.-  Hoffenberg 
claimed at the time. 
At one point, according to Hoffenberg. a 
broker forged the documents necessary for a 
S1.8 million check to be written on insurance-
company funds. The check was used to buy 
more stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to throw the insurance regula-
tors otr. the SI.8 million was reported as being 
safely invested in a money-market account. 
United Fire's former chief financial officer 
Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg's 
account. He says he recalls making one or 
two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffen-
berg's direction) about the missing bonds. 
"He said. 'Oh. yeah, they still exist.' But we 
found out later that he had sold those assets 
... leveraged them ... [and] used some mar-
gin account to take some positions in ... 
Emery and Pan Am." says Payton. 
Epstein's extraordinary creativity was, ac-
cording to Hoffenberg. responsible for the 
purchase by the insurance companies of a 
$500.000 bond, with no money down. ''Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a 
$500,000 treasury bond that would not be 
shown ... [as] margined or collateralized."  
he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked 
like it was free and clear but it actually 
wasn't," he said. 
Epstein has denied he ever had any deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls 
talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg's direction 
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve 
the missing bonds for a state examination. 
According to Allen, Epstein said, "We'll get 
them back:' He had "kind of a flippant atti-
tude." says Allen. "They never came back." 
FF
pstein. according to Hoffenberg. also 
came up with a scheme to manipulate 
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at-
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred 
when Hoffenberg's bid went wrong and the 
share price began to fall. This was alleged to 
have involved multiple clients' accounts con-
trolled by Epstein. 
Eventually, in 199L insurance regulators in 
Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case. 
and Epstein. who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of any 
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who 
was handling the suit for the regulators. says 
of Epstein. "He was very elusive.... It was 
hard to ready track him down. There were a 
substantial number of checks for significant 
dollars that were paid to him. I remem-
ber.... He was this character we never got a 
handle on. Again we presumed that he was 
involved with the Pan Am and Emery run 
that Hoffenberg made. but we never got a 
chance to depose him.- 
"From the government's discovery in the 
main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would 
seem the ao\ eminent was perhaps a bit lazy.-
says David Lewis. \‘itio represented Mitchell 
Brater. "They went for what they knew they 
could get ... and that was the fraudulent 
promissory notes [i.e.. the much larger and 
unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud, based 
in New York State].... What they couldn't 
get. they didn't bother with." 
Another lawyer involved in the criminal 
prosecution of Hoffenberg says. "In a crim-
inal investigation like that. when there is a 
auilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it. 
discovery is always incomplete.... They 
don't have to line up witnesses: they don't 
have to learn every fact that might come out 
on cross-examination." 
pstein was involved with Hotrenbera in 
	
 other questionable transactions. Finan- 
cial records show that in 1988 Epstein in-
vested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a 
company that manufactures football helmets. 
Among his co-investors were the theater 
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney 
Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this 
transaction claims that Epstein told Neder-
lender and ToborotT that he had raised his 
share of the money from a Swiss banker, 
344 I VANi 
MARCH 2 : :

whose identity they could not be allowed to 
know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the mon-
ey came from him, and Towers's financial 
statements for that year show a loan to Ep-
stein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he 
can't remember the details and has dis-
puted the accuracy of the Towers financial 
reports.) 
Around the same time, Nederlander and 
Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a 
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a 
Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan 
was to group together with two other parties 
to take a substantial declared position in the 
stock. According to a source. Epstein was 
supposed tj) help Nederlander and Toboroff 
raise S15 million. He seemed to fail to find 
uther investors, say those familiar with the 
deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an in-
vestor.) He invested Si million, which he 
told his co-investors was his own money. 
But in his 1989 deposi- 
tion he said that he put 
in only 5300.000 of his 
own money. Where did 
the rest come from? Hof-
fenberg has said it came 
from him. in a loan that 
Nederlander and Toboroff 
didn't know about. 
Two things happened 
that alarmed Nederlander 
and Toboroff. After the 
group signaled a possible 
takeover. the Pennwalt 
management threatened to 
sue the would-be raiders. 
Epstein was reluctant ini-
tially to give a deposition 
about his share of the 
money. telling Toboroff 
there were -reasons-  he 
didn't want to. Then. after the opportunity 
for new investors was closed. co-investors 
recall Epstein announcing that he'd found 
one at last: Dick Snyder. then C.E.O. of 
the publisher Simon & Schuster. who want-
ed to put up approximately 5500.000. (Nei-
ther Epstein nor Snyder can now recall 
the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition 
Epstein said that he had recruited Sny-
der, whom he had met socially, into the 
deal.) 
According to a source. Toboroff and Ne-
derlander told Epstein that Snyder was too 
kite. but, without their realizing it. Hoffen-
l.et;. has claimed. Snyder wrote a check to 
Hoffenberg and bought out some of his in-
vestment. But then Snyder wanted out. 
"Nederlander started to get these irate 
calls from [Snyder,] who wasn't part of the 
0 deal, saying he was owed all this money,-
says someone close to the deal. Toboroff 
0 a 	
Nederlander were baffled. 
a source close to Hoffenberg 
s

.'enberg paid Snyder off. 
J
ust as Nederlander and Toboroff were 
growing wary of Epstein, he became in-
creasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom 
he had met through insurance executive 
Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has 
told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in 
Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence 
by persuading him not to invest in the stock 
market, just as the 1987 crash was approach-
ing. His story has subsequently changed. 
When asked if Wexner knew about his con-
nection to Hoffenbere. Epstein said that he 
began working for Wexner in 1989, and that 
"it was certainly not the same time." 
Wherever and whenever it was that Ep-
stein and Wexner actually met, there was 
an immediate and strong personal chem-
istry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is "very 
smart with a combination of excellent judg-
ment and unusually high standards. Also. 
he is always a most loyal friend.- 
OFFICE SPACE 
The "office-  in Epstein's house. It has no 
computers, but it does have a desk that 
Epstein tells people once belonged to banker 
.1. P. Morgan. and "the lamest Persian rue 
you'll ever see in a private home.- 
Sources say Epstein proved that he could 
be useful to Wexner as well, with "fresh" 
ideas about investments. -Wexner had a cou-
ple of bad investments. and Jeffrey cleaned 
those up right away.-  says a former associ-
ate of Epstein's. 
Before he signed on with Wexner. Epstein 
had several meetings with Harold Levin• then 
head of Wexner Investments, in which he 
enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin 
found incomprehensible. "In fact.-  says some-
one who used to work very closely with Wex-
ner. "almost everyone at the Limited won-
dered who Epstein was: he literally came 
out of nowhere." 
"Everyone was mystified as to what his 
appeal was." says Robert Morosky. a former 
vice-chairman of the Limited.  
M
uch of Epstein's work is related to clean-
ing up, tightening budgets, and efficien-
cies. One person who worked for Wexner and 
who saw a contract drawn up between the 
two men says Epstein is involved in "every-
thing, not just a little here. a little there. 
Everything!" In addition, he says. "Wexner 
likes having a hatchet man.... Whenever 
there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jef-
frey on it.... He has a reputation for being 
ruthless but he gets the job done." 
Epstein has evidently been asked to fire 
personal-staff members when needed. "He 
was that mysterious person that everyone was 
scared to death of.-  says a former employee. 
Meanwhile. he is also less than popular 
with some people outside Wexner's company 
with whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' 
himself into the construction process of Les-
lie Wexner's yacht.... That resulted in liti-
gation down the road between Mr. Wexner 
and the shipyard that 
eventually built the ves-
sel." says Lars Forsberg.

to sue a client for payment

formed ... without issue 
on the performance.-  says Forsberg. In 
the end the matter was settled. but Ep-
stein claims he now has no recollection 
of it, 
The incident is one of a number of disputes 
Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are 
for sums so tiny as to be baffling: for instance. 
Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert 
Glass. who sold him the Palm Beach house in 
1990. for S13,444—Epstein claimed this was 
owed him for furnishings removed by Glass. 
In 1998 the L.S. Attorney's Office sued 
Epstein for illegally subletting the former 
home of the deputy consul general of Iran 
to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Er ,win  
paid 515,000 a month in rent to 
the StAie 
Department, but he charged Fi5her  
his colleagues P0,000. Though arc i
c 
terms of the agreement are sea 
court ruled against Epstein.

he is winning. Whether in conversations or 
negotiations, he always stands back and lets 
the other person determine the style and 
manner of the conversation or negotiation. 
And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey 
sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick 
a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you 
choose your weapon." 
One case is rather more serious. Currently, 
Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on 
loans from its private-banking arm for $20 
million. Epstein claims that Citibank "fraud-
ulenly induced" him into borrowing the 
money for investments. Citibank disputes this 
charge. 
The legal papers for another case offer a 
rare window into Epstein's finances. In 1995. 
Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord. 
the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his 
office in the Villard House. He claimed that 
they were breaking the terms of the lease by 
not letting his staff in at night. The case was 
eventually settled. However. one of the papers 
filed in this dispute is Epstein's financial state-
ment for 1988. in which he claimed to be 
worth S20 million. He listed that he owned 
$7 million in securities. SI million in cash. 
zero in residential property (although he 
told sources that he had already bought the 
home in Palm Beach). and Sll million in 
other assets. including his investment in 
Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: "The 
company had been bought with a huge 
amount of debt. and it wasn't public. so it 
was meaningless attach a figure like that to 
it ... the price it cost was about S 1.2 mil-
lion.-  The co-investors bought out Epstein's 
share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately 
S3 million. At that time, when Epstein was 
asked. as a routine matter. to sign a paper 
guaranteeing he had access to a few million 
dollars in case of any subsequent disputes 
over the sale price. Wexner signed for him. 
Epstein has explained that this was because 
the co-investors wanted an indemnity against 
being sued by Wexner. One of the investors 
calls this "bullshit." 
F
pstein's appointment to the board of 
New York's Rockefeller University in 
2000 brought him into greater social promi-
nence. Boasting such social names as Nancy 
Kissinger. Brooke Astor. and Robert Bass. 
the board also includes such pre-eminent 
scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Gold-
stein. "Epstein was thrilled to be elected," 
says someone who knows him. 
After one term Epstein resigned. Accord-
ing to New York magazine, this was because 
he didn't like to wear a suit to meetings. A 
ilIcelipe son tb- the Rockefeller board says 
lc 	 had insufficient time 
iicinber recalls that he 
was "arrogant" and "not a good fit." The 
spokesperson admits that it is "infrequent" 
for board members not to be renominated 
after only one term. 
Still, the recent spate of publicity Ep-
stein has inspired does not seem to have 
fazed him. In November he was spotted in 
the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion 
show at New York's Lexington Avenue Ar-
mory; around the same time the usual co-
terie of friends and beautiful women were 
whisked off to Little St. James (which he 
tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff) 
for a long weekend. 
Thanks to Epstein's introductions, says 
Martin Nowak. the biologist finds himself 
moving from Princeton to Harvard. where 
he is assuming the joint position of profes-
sor of mathematics and professor of biolo-
gy. Epstein has pledged at least S25 million 
to Harvard to create the Epstein Program 
for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary 
Dynamics. and Epstein will have an office 
at the university. The program will be dedi-
cated to searching for nature's algorithms. a 
pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak's. For 
Epstein this mu_: be the summit of every-
thing he has wor.ed toward: he has been 
seen proudly disp:..iing Harvard president 
Larry Summers's letter of commitment as 
if he can't quite believe it is real. He says he 
was reluctant to have his name attached to 
the program. but Summers persuaded him. 
He rang his mentor Wexner about it. and 
Wexner told him it was all right. 
An insatiable. restless soul. always on the 
move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount 
of downtime into ins hectic work schedule. 
Yet there is something almost programmed 
about his relaxation: it's as if even plea-
sure has to be measured in terms of self-
improvement. Nowak says that. when he 
goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, 
they'll get up at six and. as the sun rises. 
have three-hour conversations about theoret-
ical physics. 'Then he'll go otT and do some 
work. re-appear. and we'll talk some more.- 
Another person who went to the island 
with Epstein. MaXWell. and several beautiful 
women remembers that the women "sat 
around one night teasing him about the 
kinds of grasping women who might want 
to date him. He was amused by the idea.... 
He's like a king in his own world." 
Many people comment there is some-
thing innocent. almost childlike about Jef-
frey Epstein. They see this as refreshing. given 
the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan 
Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to 
know Epstein. his wife asked him if he would 
still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed 
for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied. 
"Absolutely. I would be as interested in him 
as a friend if we had hamburgers on the 
boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about 
his ideas."

"DISCO Bloodbath" author James St. James is following up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig 
with another true-crime tome. He's shopping around "Killer Grandpa," his investigation into a lynching that his 
grandfather led in 1935. "My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that 
allegedly raped a white woman," James told us. "About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun 
around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and I write about what really 
happened." James, a 1980s club kid who fell in with Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in "Party 
Monster," the movie adaptation of "Disco Bloodbath." But James said he was "shocked" when he watched a few 
scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig. "I didn't know I was so gay! I thought I was 
more like Steve McQueen, but Seth is flouncing around the whole time. Seth is much cuter than me, actually, 
and looks better in drag."

PAGE SIX'S scoop last month that mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein had flown Bill Clinton, Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private 727 has sent journalists all over town trying to find out just who 
Epstein really is. 
Vanity Fair has a reporter on his trail, but New York magazine beats them to the punch with a feature this week 
on Epstein's strange history. 
Epstein, 49, a former Dalton School math teacher from Coney Island, is said to manage $15 billion for super-
wealthy clients he'll only take on if they have at least $1 billion in assets. 
"According to people who know him," New York reports, "if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the 
services of Epstein & Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you." 
Noted mergers/acquisitions lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft recalls trying to give 
Epstein a client whose funds were below the $1 billion cutoff. 
"I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him," Block reports. "Said the account was 
too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that's Jeffrey." 
Most Wall Streeters, however, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. "My belief is that Jeff 
maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him," says one 
powerful investor. "He once told me that he has 300 people working for him, and I've also heard he manages 
Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz." 
Some say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a 
suit, supposedly telling a friend, "It feels like wearing a dress."

One power player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump. 
"I've known Jeffrey for 15 years," The Donald tells the magazine. "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is 
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." 
Another thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a 
taste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,000-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 71st Street. 
Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000. 
Epstein's mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $1. 
Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior. 
"I don't want to live in another person's house," Epstein told New York. 
Blind dater 
CHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The "Law & Order" hunk was set up on a blind date with 
Rose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at 
the Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the 
set of "Sex and the City." MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson. 
'Rockets' soars 
"ROCKETS Redglare!" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and downtown icon - won the Grand 
Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by 
Luis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets' pals Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim 
Jarmusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 350-pound former bodyguard of punk 
legend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of Buscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of 
drug abuse. 
Bizarre union 
BOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. "He treated women like the rest of the 
world treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?" she told "20/20" contributing correspondent 
Chris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and 
videotape, Pat insists: "We had a wonderful sex life. We had a wonderful marriage." Crane was bludgeoned to 
death in 1978 with a camera tripod. 
Plot device 
GAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel "The 
Night We Met," a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Byrnes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After 
making references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Byrnes even attempts to replicate one of our 
items in the climax. Byrnes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does 
have us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece.

Even without Ozzy, crowd 
finds entertainment galore 
at Ozzfest, 48 
Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case 
Defendant's lawyers take him on; he slams state attorney 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
In the case of Palm 
Beach financier Jeffrey Ep-
stein, it seems, at times, as if 
two men are accused of 
wrongdoing: Epstein and 
Palm Beach Police Chief  
Michael Reiter. 
Epstein, 53, was indict-
ed last month on a charge of 
felony solicitation of prosti-
tution solely because of Re-
iter's "craziness," one of 
Epstein's lawyers said. His 
department disseminated  
"a distorted view of the 
case" and behaved in a 
"childish" manner when the 
grand jury didn't indict Ep-
stein on the charges it 
sought, another Epstein 
lawyer complained. 
To hear the Epstein  
camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a 
loose cannon better suited 
to be the sheriff of Mayber-
ry. They whisper that he's 
embroiled in a messy di-
vorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for 
divorce from his wife, Jill, 
last year, after 24 years of 
marriage. They have a son,  
18, and a daughter, 14. The 
couple is scheduled to go to 
mediation Wednesday. 
Nothing in the court file 
suggests their split is par-
ticularly ugly. 
Reiter incurred the 
wrath of the Epstein camp 
as well as the state attor-

Colleagues cite chief's professionalism, integrity 
► REITER from 1B 
ney's office for two reasons. 
First, he pressed for Epstein 
to be charged with the more 
serious crimes of sexual ac-
tivity with minors. Second, he 
slammed State Attorney Bar-
ry Krischer in blunt language 
seldom used by one law-
enforcement official con-
cerning another because of 
what he perceived as that of-
fice's mishandling of the 
case. 
In a letter to Krischer 
written May 1, Reiter called 
his actions in the Epstein 
case "highly unusual." He 
added, "I must urge you to . . 
consider if good and suffi-' 
cient reason exists to require 
your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases." 
In short, Reiter told the 
county's top prosecutor for 
the past 13 years that he 
ought to get off the case. "It 
looks like a departure from  
professionalism," Miami-
Dade State Attorney 
Katherine Fernandez Rundle 
said of Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's in-
dictment, Reiter referred the 
case to the FBI to determine 
whether the super-rich, 
super-connected defendant 
had violated any federal laws. 
Reiter won't discuss the 
case or the broadsides aimed 
at him. But others almost 
uniformly use one word to 
describe the chief: profes-
sional. 
"I have always been im-
pressed by Mike's profes-
sionalism and his leader-
ship," said Rick Lincoln, chief 
of the Lantana Police Depart-
ment and a Palm Beach 
County cop for 32 years. 
"The town of Palm Beach 
has a very professional police 
department. We all consider 
Mike to be our peer and a 
man of integrity." 
Reiter: Town 
Manager Peter 
Elwell says the 
Palm Beach 
police chief's 
well worth his 
$144,000 sal-
ary. 
Juno Beach Police Chief 
H.C. Clark II agreed. Al-
though he doesn't know Re-
iter well, he has met with him 
on countywide law enforce-
ment issues. "I've never seen 
him lose his cool. I've never 
seen anything but a profes-
sional demeanor from him." 
Reiter joined the Palm 
Beach Police Department in 
1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year 
patrol job at the University of 
Pittsburgh. His personnel 
jacket shows consistently ex-
cellent job evaluations. 
Posh Palm Beach is no 
hotbed of crime, and in his 
first year on the job, a resi- 
dent confined to his home 
with a sick child thanked Re-
iter for delivering a few Cokes 
to the house. Reiter refused 
payment for the beverages. 
Another resident thanked 
Reiter for shutting off his 
car's headlights in his drive-
way, saying a valet must have 
been at fault. 
• Reiter worked everything 
from road patrol to organized 
crime, vice and narcotics. 
And he's no novice at investi-
gations involving the island's 
rich and famous. He was the 
lead detective probing the 
drug overdose death of David 
Kennedy in 1984. He also was 
one of the officers who 
worked the investigation of 
William Kennedy Smith, who 
was charged in 1991 — and 
later acquitted — with raping 
a woman at the Kennedy 
family compound in Palm 
Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's 
degree in human resource  
development from Palm 
Beach Atlantic University, al-
so has attended the FBI Na-
tional Academy in Quantico, 
Va., and management cours-
es at Harvard. He's been ac-
tive in countywide interagen-
cy law enforcement 
organizations and has a "top 
secret" national security 
clearance. 
"He has a perspective 
that's broader than just ad-
dressing the needs of the 
town," said Town Manager 
Peter Elwell, who promoted 
Reiter from assistant chief to 
chief in March 2001. Reiter 
makes more than $144,000 as 
the town's top cop. Elwell 
thinks he's worth it. 
"He's very businesslike, 
very straightforward. He's 
not easily agitated or flam-
boyant. He's about the work," 
Elwell said. "I think that his 
service as chief has been 
outstanding in five-plus 
years."

Jeffrey Epstein - a self-proclaimed billionaire who hobnobs with moguls and pledged $25 million to Harvard - is 
actually a small potatoes ex-bounty hunter with a questionable financial background, says a report. 
Epstein, a 50-year-old Ralph Lauren lookalike who claims to manage a billionaires-only fund, has made 
headlines for his high- society lifestyle; among his attention-grabbing moves was flying President Clinton and 
Kevin Spacey to Africa on a private jet. 
But a report in the March issue of Vanity Fair, on newsstands this week, unmasks Epstein's mystery image. 
Epstein wasn't exactly the top gun at Bear Stearns, as he claims - and left the firm amid a swirl of rumors and an 
SEC violation, the article said. 
His mentor in high finance was Steve Hoffenberg, the bill collector turned hustler now serving 20 years in prison 
for running the nation's costliest Ponzi scheme, the report says. 
The article says that when Epstein worked for Hoffenberg, he cooked up some of Hoffenberg's questionable 
financing deals - a claim Epstein has denied. 
Epstein has also been involved in numerous lawsuits, including one in which Citibank is suing him for defaulting 
on $20 million in loans from its private banking arm. 
Epstein and his lawyer, Jeffrey Schantz, couldn't be reached for comment on the article. 
The article said that Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, except for one - retail magnate Leslie 
Wexner, who calls Epstein "smart . 	
[with] high standards . . . and a loyal friend."

THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the fat and fraudulent former 
owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. I hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the 
Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her 
relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&M-themed party. 
Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set"

THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the fat and fraudulent former 
owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. I hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the 
Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her 
relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&M-themed party. 
Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set" 
have recently sworn off any kind of publicity. A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid 
"Bright Young Things," written by one of their own, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this crowd as a bunch of 
twits living off their trust funds. 
Ghislaine's own funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least 
one business in New York. But Maxwell's own ill-gotten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht, 
which was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the 
crash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to own an apartment on the 
Upper East Side and a mews house in London. 
She is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly 
has holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of attractive young women, and it's 
said that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals. 
Ghislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be 
heavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing 
were diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going down the toilet.

Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of 
Mystery 
He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize—winning scientists, 
CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine 
Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Bill 
Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his 
private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he 
is. 
By Landon Thomas Jr. 
He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of 
airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladies --
to say nothing of a relentless brain that 
challenges Nobel Prize—winning scientists 
across the country -- and for financial 
markets around the world. Ever since the 
Post's "Page Six" ran an item about the 
president's late-September visit to Africa 
with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker -- on 
his new benefactor's customized Boeing 
727 -- the question of the day has been: 
Who in the world is Jeffrey Epstein?

said to run $15 billion for wealthy clients, 
yet aside from Limited founder Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held 
secret. A former Dalton math teacher, he maintains a peripatetic salon of 
brilliant scientists yet possesses no bachelor's degree. For more than ten 
years, he's been linked to Manhattan-London society figure Ghislaine 
Maxwell, daughter of the mysteriously deceased media titan Robert Maxwell, 
yet he lives the life of a bachelor, logging 600 hours a year in his various 
planes as he scours the world for investment opportunities. He owns what is 
said to be Manhattan's largest private house yet runs his business from a 
100-acre private island in St. Thomas.

open bids for it. Soros. Wasserstein. Kravis. Weill. The Sturm and Drang of 
their successes and failures has been played out in public. Epstein breaks the 
mold. Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to 
know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way he likes it. 
"My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though 
you won't get a straight answer from him," says one well-known investor. "He 
once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he 
manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the 
Wizard of Oz -- there may be less there than meets the eye."

Says another prominent Wall Streeter: "He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque 
figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of 
aloofness. The whole thing is weird.' 
The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully 
coiffed head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A 	
Adve 
raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour 
and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal 
instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. He is an enthusiastic 
member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. 
He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is 
rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his 
board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. "It 
feels like a dress," he told one friend. 
Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched 
alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you 
talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen 
years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to 
be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and 
many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his 
social life." 
But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about 
Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in 
people -- be it politics or science. It's what I do," he has said to friends. And 
his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a

species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be 
up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the 
rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa, 
"If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike 
Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign 
leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the worlds greatest 
politician." 
"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist 
with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-
first-century science," Clinton says through a spokesman. "I especially 
appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work 
on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating 
HIV/AIDS." 
Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to 
be speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. 
While they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell 
has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons 
Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. it's a mysterious relationship that they 
have,' says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. "In one way, they are 
soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional 
relationship, where they serve each other's purposes." 
Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-
octane than Epstein's, lent a little pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed, 
at a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see 
Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-
educated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own 
helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison 
Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently 
seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no 
boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social 
columns, but there is much more to him than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of 
the private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. "He's a talented money manager 
and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual, 
though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-
promoter." 
Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High 
School. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper 
Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU's 
Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the 
heart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975, 
Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School. 
By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets 
Society type of figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate 
mathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that 
he said to Epstein point-blank: "What are you doing teaching math at Dalton? 
You should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace 
Greenberg a call."

The Wexner War 
August 1, 2003 
We can only imagine Limited founder and apparel mag- nate Leslie Wexner's 
consternation over the leaking of a document entitled, Wexner Analysis: Israeli 
Communication Priorities 2003. The report was prepared for the Wexner Foundation and 
provides insight into Wexner's relationship with the state of Israel. As the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer noted, Wexner keeps his personal life "under padlock." But what has 
surfaced over the years simply adds to his mystery. In the Shapiro murder file, 
personally ordered destroyed by Columbus Chief of Police James Jackson, Wexner is 
listed as an alleged organized crime associate. A December 1995 Architectural Digest 
article and a follow-up 1996 New York Times report detailed the inner sanctum of 
Wexner's former Manhattan townhouse, one of the largest in the city. 
"Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a 
stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit 
television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink," wrote 
the Times. The townhouse is now reportedly owned by Wexner's even more mysterious 
protégé, Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
Epstein, who recently loaned his jet to President Clinton, is usually seen in the company 
of Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of deceased publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. After 
Maxwell fell or was pushed off his yacht in 1991, it was revealed that he was working for 
the Israeli government and the Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence service. While Maxwell's 
ties to the Mossad are well-documented, Epstein's connections are less well known. The 
London Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follows: 
"He's Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he's a concert pianist, property developer, a 
CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad." New York Magazine claims Epstein 
is the man who moves Wexner's billions around the globe. 
Wexner's philanthropic side is more public. In 1998, the Wall Street Journal reported 
that Wexner was part of the "'Mega Group,' a loosely organized club of 20 of the nation's 
wealthiest and most influential Jewish businessmen." The Mega Group meets 
purportedly to discuss "philanthropy," but others have speculated that their charitable 
interests are often a cover for lobbying activities on behalf of Israel. The Wall Street 
Journal identified Max Fisher, a Detroit financier and billionaire, as a member of the 
Mega Group. Fisher was used as a private Middle East diplomat by President Gerald Ford 
during the 1970s and is considered Wexner's mentor. 
So, when the Wexner Analysis report was leaked, it caused a stir but no questioning of 
Wexner's little-explored relationships with Epstein and Fisher. Frank Lutz, the Republican 
Party pollster and spin doctor, prepared the Wexner Analysis. Lutz's report essentially 
outlines a political PR campaign "as the post-war dust settles over the Iraqi desert." 
The Wexner Analysis points out that "... many sympathize with the plight of the 
Palestinian people, [but] there is no love lost for Yassir Arafat." The report complains 
that, "the emergence of Mahmoud Abbas as the new Palestinian Prime Minister comes 
exactly at the wrong time." 
Why? "His ascent to power seems legitimate. He is a fresh face, and a clean-shaven one 
at that. He speaks well and dresses in Western garb," the report states. Lutz's 
assessment is that "the Palestinians throw us this curve ball."

Still, the Wexner Analysis emphasizes that "now is the time to link American success in 
dealing with terrorism and dictators from a position of strength to Israel's ongoing 
efforts to eradicate terrorism on and within its borders." 
Lutz, realizing the value of an Arab bogeymen, stresses that "'Saddam Hussein' are the 
two words that tie Israel to America and are most likely to deliver support in Congress. 
The day we allow Saddam to take his eventual place in the trash heap of history is the 
day we lose our strongest weapon in the linguistic defense of Israel. 
In the "Essential Conclusion" section of the report, Lutz offers 10 recommendations. The 
first is: "Iraq colors all. Saddam is your best defense, even if he is dead. For a year - a 
SOLID YEAR - you should be invoking the name of Saddam Hussein and how Israel was 
always behind American efforts to rid the world of this ruthless dictator and liberate their 
people." 
Now, as the occupation of Iraq begins to look like the dreaded quagmire, and American 
troops are dying at the rate of almost one a day, more scrutiny should come to the role 
of those who pushed for the attack on Iraq, since Saddam Hussein neither had links to 
Al Qaeda nor posed a threat to the United States. 
The Project for the New American Century, the major ideological force behind the illegal 
attack on Iraq, are generally more concerned with Hussein's threat to Israel than to the 
United States. Recent reports that Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, 
advised President Bush to include the bogus reference to uranium from Niger in the 
State of the Union address demonstrates a much bigger problem. 
Lobbying groups like the Mega Group and government insiders like Wolfowitz and 
Richard Pearle are engaged in a systematic campaign to identify Israeli national security 
interests with U.S. military and security interests. The Wexner Analysis merely 
documents this extensive, often covert campaign, that deserves public debate and 
democratic discourse, not secret PR campaigns.

Epstein 
After long probe, rifici 
billionaire faces °6  
solicitation charge 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein 
paid to have underage girls and young 
women brought to his home, where he re-
ceived massages and sometimes sex, ac-
cording to an investigation 
by the Palm Beach Police 
Department. 
Palm Beach police spent 
months sifting through Ep-
stein's trash and watching 
his waterfront home and 
Palm Beach International 
Airport to keep tabs on his 
private jet. An indictment 
charging Epstein, 53, was 
unsealed Monday, charging him with one 
count of felony solicitation of prostitution. 
Palm Beach police thought there was 
probable cause to charge Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and 
lascivious molestation. 
Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry 
with State Attorney Barry Krischer's han-
dling of the case that he wrote a memo

'Mystery money man faces soliciting charge 
By NICOLE JANOK 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
A part-time Palm Beacher who has 
socialized with Donald Trump, Bill 
Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed 
early Sunday with accused drug dealers, 
drunken drivers and wife beaters after 
he was charged with soliciting a prosti-
tute. 
Manhattan money manager Jeffrey 
Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home 
on El Brillo Way at 1:45 a.m. He was 
released hours later on $3,000 bond. 
Epstein was indicted last week by a 
state grand jury, according to state at-
torney's spokesman Mike Edmondson. 
Despite Epstein's arrest, the indictment 
containing the allegations remained 
sealed Sunday and Edmondson provid-
ed no details. 
Unlike most accused johns, Epstein 
was charged with a third-degree felony 
instead of a misdemeanor. Under state 
law, a solicitation charge usually is ele-
vated to a more serious felony when the 
defendant has at least two solicitation  
convictions. 
However, checks of court records 
here and in New York Sunday turned up 
no such convictions. 
Epstein could not be reached. Ed-
mondson said he was being represented 
by West Palm Beach attorney Jack 
Goldberg, who declined comment. 
Epstein is the president of J Epstein 
& Co., a money management company 
based in Manhattan that caters to ultra-
wealthy clientele, according to pub-

mysterious billionaire 
has been on probation 
IP. SOLICITING from 113 
lished reports. National 
magazines have described 
him as a "mysterious billion-
aire" who lives in a 45,000-
square-foot New York City 
mansion. 
He has been in trouble 
before. In 1993, he and two 
other defendants were 
charged in federal court with 
three counts of postal larceny 
and theft and one count of 
property theft. Epstein plead 
guilty to a single charge of 
conspiring to steal U.S. 
Treasury checks from resi-
dential mailboxes and re-
ceived 5 years' probation. 
The remaining charges were 
dropped. 
Since then, Epstein's 
name has turned up in New 
York City's tabloids. The New 
York Post noted he flew Pres-
ident Clinton and Kevin 
Spacey to Africa on his pri-
vate Boeing 727. In 2003, the 
paper dubbed him one of the 
Big Apple's "top studs." 
In 2004, Epstein bid 
against Trump for a 43,000-
square foot Palm Beach es-
tate once owned by health-
care magnate Abe Gosman. 
Trump topped Epstein with a 
$41.35 million bid.

Investor facing felony sex charge 
By WILLIAM KELLY 
Daily News Staff Writer 
Thursday, July 27, 2006 
A billionaire investor and part-time Palm Beach resident has been indicted on a felony 
charge of solicitation of prostitution after police say he had sex with underage girls whom 
he paid for massage sessions at his El Brillo Way home. 
A Palm Beach County grand jury found that Jeffrey E. Epstein, 53, "did solicit, induce, 
entice or procure" prostitution with girls, who were between 14 and 16 years old, on at 
least three occasions between Aug. 1, 2004, and Oct. 31, 2005. 
Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,000 
bond. His attorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third- 
degree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the 
girls were minors. 
The next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date 
will be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-
degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
A resident of New York, Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot 
waterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since 1990. 
The indictment followed an 11-n 
that began in March 2005 after a wuna told puiicC, twat her 
may have been molested by a man in Palm Beach. 
The investigation also focused on Epstein's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York 
City, and on Haley Robson, 20, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by 
Epstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to 
Epstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor 
Robson has been indicted or arrested on any charge. 
Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses concerning the 
massages and alleged unlawful sexual activity. 
During their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone 
numbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according 
to police. Epstein would then pay the girls $200 or $300, police said. 
07/26/17

Epstein is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with some of the girls on three 
occasions, and paid one girl $1,000 after she objected during sex, police said. 
During the investigation, police said they learned of several more young women, all 18 
years old or older, who consented to the "same massage routine" when they went to work 
for Epstein, according to the police report. 
Police said they learned of these women by searching Epstein's trash, through 
surveillance of his property and his private jet, and by reviewing telephone message 
books retrieved during a warrant search of the house. 
Epstein's spokesman, Sean Cassidy, said Epstein would have no comment for this story. 
Cassidy and Goldberger declined to answer questions. But Goldberger said in a prepared 
statement that "the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were 
not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney's office questioned the 
credibility of the witnesses." 
The statement also said that "a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly 
unsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr. 
Epstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute." 
Goldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph 
examiner, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police 
search of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations, 
Goldberger said. 
Solicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-
degree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or ir.nrz alleged offenses, 
rr 
After completing its investigation, ral;-,1 	
police turned the 	l'J 
office several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be 
arrested on four counts of unlav,-f.,:: 	
minor a.,;,1 
lascivious molestation, all second-degree fcle:;iL:. 
Janet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the department handed the case 
to Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence. 
"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an 
arrest warrant with the State Attorney's Office, which we did," Kinsella said. 
But rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before 
the grand jury. 
Police Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he 
suggested in a May 1 memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case. Reiter said in 
07/26/17

letters to the alleged victims and their parents that justice was not served by the 
indictment and that the case has been referred to the FBI to determine if federal laws 
were violated. 
Edmondson said Krischer's office reviewed the police evidence and decided to 
investigate further. 
"The prosecutor looks at the witnesses and physical evidence from a broader view," 
Edmondson said. "Because of the nature of the allegations, in particular the lengthy 
sexual activity on part of the individuals and elements of financial reward to the 
individuals, the case was referred to the grand jury. The grand jury heard from law-
enforcement officials and witnesses and reviewed all of the evidence before determining 
that the appropriate charge was felony solicitation of prostitution." 
Town returned donation 
Before the police investigation began, Epstein had donated $90,000 to the department for 
an equipment purchase that was never made. The money was returned to Epstein on 
Monday, Finance Director Jane Struder said. 
Epstein has been known to date top models and was once named by the New York Post 
as one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors. 
His rise to wealth has been characterized by some as mysterious. Epstein was a math 
teacher at Manhattan's posh Dalton School when he started handling the money of 
billionaire fashion czar Leslie Wexner, who owns The Limited, Victoria's Secret, Express

He was one of the bidders on the Abe Gosman estate on North County Road, which

In a March 2003 article in Vanity Fair, writer Vicky Ward described Epstein as a

WHAT THE PRESS CALLS 'EPSTEIN SEX SCANDAL' SOUNDS A BIT MORE I 
— THU, JUL 27, 2006 — 
Ok, we know we gave Jeffrey Epstein a minor bullet point in our little 
gossip round-up. But that's because we are just now going through The 
Smoking Gun report on the Donald Trump role model and fellow 
scumbag, who not only recently arrested for soliciting sex from a masseuse, 
but who, according to "a former houseman," received three massages a day 
from girls who appeared to be, at the most, sixteen or seventeen years old. 
In case you haven't seen it, things get much worse. 
He also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had 
to "wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" which 
had been left in a sink. Alfredo Rodriguez, a former house manager, 
told probers that he "knew" Epstein's masseuses were still in high 
school. Rodriguez also told of having to "wipe down" vibrators and sex toys post-massage and 
returning them to an armoire near Epstein's bed. 
It gets worse. About 22 pages of allegedly underage girls traipsing in and out of the house and engaging in various 
sexual acts with Epstein worse. The affidavid from a 14 year old girl, who's name is being withheld, names Haley 
Robinson and Sara Keller as two of the girls involved in this sick story. We can't get into all the details here —
we have neither the stomach nor the time to sort through the novella sized account of Epstein's alleged 
escapades. What did jump out at us, however, more than the egg-shaped penis or the photos of naked underage 
girls all over his house, was the part which accounts Epstein's alleged rape of a sixteen year old girl. (Yes, all sex 
with a minor is rape, but this involves the girl screaming "No!" and Epstein paying her $1,000 after "forcibly 
holding her down on the table.") 
[Witheld] stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and having sex and 
proudly display the photographs within the home. [Withheld] stated during one visit to Epstein's 
house in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend Nada Marcinkova was also 
present. [Withheld] provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each other's

breasts and kiss for Epstein to enjoy. Toward to end of this massage, Epstein grabbed [withheld] 
and turned her over onto her stomach on the massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into 
her vagina. [Withheld] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [Withheld] became 
very upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to 
pump inside of her. She screamed "No!" and Epstein stopped. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of 
her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for that visit. 
Umm, can you say really, really fucked up? Read the thing for yourself, if you care to, but we just felt it necessary 
to point out that this story is more than lube and vibrators and massages. This is like, allegedly, really messed up 
stuff. And we are more than astounded at the press for not bringing these accusations to light. Very, very 
disappointing. Maybe since he's friends with Bill Clinton, Ron Burkle, and Donald Trump, accusations that 
he's raping little girls can be omitted from the news.

Billionaire In Palm Beach Sex Scandal 
Investigators: Moneyman Jeffrey Epstein solicited teen masseuses 
JULY 26--Prepare to take a shower after reading this 
remarkably sleazy probable cause affidavit filed in the 
case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who was 
arrested Sunday for soliciting sex from a masseuse at his 
Florida mansion. Beginning in mid-March 2005, Epstein 
became the target of a sexual battery probe conducted by 
the Palm Beach Police Department, according to the 
affidavit, which alleges that Epstein, 53, paid a series of 
underage girls to engage in sexual activity with him. 
Frankly, there are too many dirty details in the affidavit 
to properly synopsize, but, if investigators are to be 
believed, Epstein has a thing for teenagers, vibrators, and 
assorted massage lotions. Epstein, pictured above in a Palm Beach County 
Sheriff's Office mug shot, has been indicted on a felony solicitation of 
prostitution rap. The indictment, which does not allege that the solicited 
was a minor, charges that the crime occurred between August 2004 and Octob 
2005. In a statement, Epstein's lawyer dismissed the affidavit's charges a 
"false accusations." Jose Alessi, a former houseman, told cops that Epstei 
would receive three massages daily and that his masseuses were "younger an 
 
younger" and "appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most 
also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had to "wash of 
massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" which had been left in a sink. 
Alfredo Rodriguez, a former house manager, told probers that he "knew" Eps 
masseuses were still in high school. Rodriguez also told of having to "wip 
down" vibrators and sex toys post-massage and returning them to an armoire 
Epstein's bed. In a 2002 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Donald Trum

called the moneyman a "terrific guy" who "likes beautiful women as much as 
and many of them are on the younger side." Epstein, who reportedly runs a 
multibillion-dollar investment fund, travels in his own Boeing 727 (upon w 
he has transported Bill Clinton to Africa) and owns a 45,000-square-foot m

Epstein's Palm Beach mansion at 358 El Brillo Way. 
Jeffrey Epstein craved big homes, elite friends 
and, investigators say, underage girls 
By ANDREW MARRA, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WINGED GARGOYLES guarded the gate at Jeffrey 
Epstein's Palm Beach mansion. Inside, hidden cameras 
trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went. 
For the police detectives 
who sifted through the gar-
bage outside and kept 
records of visitors, it was the 
lair of a troubling target. 
Epstein, one of the most 
mysterious of the country's 
mega-rich, was known as 
much for his secrecy as for 
his love of fine things: mag-
nificent homes, private jets, 
beautiful women, friendships 
with the world's elite. 
But at Palm Beach police 
headquarters, he was be-
coming known for something  
else: the regular arrival of 
teenage girls he hired to give 
him massages and, police 
say, perform sexual favors. 
Epstein was different 
from most sexual abuse sus-
pects; he was far more pow-
erful. He counted among his 
friends former President Bill 
Clinton, Donald Trump and 
Prince Andrew, along with 
some of the most prominent 
legal, scientific and business 
minds in the country. 
When detectives started 
Epstein's mysterious lifestyle 
began to unravel after claims 
of sexual activity with minors.

asking questions and teenage girls 
started talking, a wave of legal 
resistance followed. 
If Palm Beach police didn't know 
quite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they 
found out soon enough. 
Epstein, now 53, was a quintes-
sential man of mystery. He amassed 
his for tune and friends quietly, 
always in the background as he 
navigated New York high society. 
When he first attracted notice in 
the early 1990s, it was on account of 
the woman he was dating. Ghislaine 
Maxwell, daughter of the late British 
media tycoon Robert Maxwell. 
In a lengthy article, headlined 
'The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-
well's Secret Love," the British Mail 
on Sunday tabloid laid out specula-
tive stories that the socialite's beau 
was a CIA spook, a math teacher, a 
concert pianist or a corporate head-
hunter. 
"But what is the truth about 
him?" the newspaper wondered. 
"Like Maxwell, Epstein is both 
flamboyant and intensely private." 
The media frenzy did not begin 
in full until a decade later. In Sep-
tember 2002. Epstein was flung into 
the limelight when he flew Clinton 
and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris 
Tucker to Africa on his private jet. 
Suddenly everyone wanted to 
know who Epstein was. New York 
magazine and Vanity Fair published 
lengthy profiles. The New York Post 
listed him as one of the city's most 
eligible bachelors and began 
describing him in its gossip columns 
with adjectives such as "mysterious" 
and "reclusive." 
Although Epstein gave no inter-
views, the broad strokes of his past 
started to come into focus. 
Building a life of extravagance 
He was born blue-collar in 1953, 
the son of a New York City parks 
department employee, and raised in

hood. He left college without a

1 stymies detectives 
fuel extraordinary desires. 
hi March 2005, a worried mother 
contacted Palm Beach police. She 
said another parent had overheard a 
conversation between their chil-
dren. 
Now the mother was afraid her 
14-year-old daughter had been 
molested by a man on the island. 
The phone call triggered an 
extensive investigation, one that 
would lead detectives to Epstein but 
leave them frustrated. 
Palm Beach police and the state 
attorney's office have declined to 
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach 
police report detailing the criminal 
probe offers a window into what 
detectives faced as they sought to 
close in on Epstein. 
Detectives interviewed the girl, 
who told them a friend had invited 
her to a rich man's house to perform 
a massage. She said the friend told 
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the 
house, she said she was paid $300 
after stripping to her panties and 
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated. 
Police interview 5 alleged victims 
The investigation began in full 
after the girl identified Epstein in a 
photo as the man who had paid her. 
Police arranged for garbage trucks 
to set aside Epstein's trash so police 
could sift through it. They set up a 
video camera to record the comings 
and goings at his home. They mon-
itored an airport hangar for signs of 
his private jet's arrivals and depar-
tures. 
They quickly learned that the 
woman who took the 141ear-old girl 
to Epstein's house was Haley Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Community Col-
lege student from Loxahatchee. In a 
sworn statement at police head-
quarters, Robson, then 18, admitted 
she had taken at least six girls to visit 
Epstein, all between the ages of 14 
and 16. Epstein, paid her for each 
visit, she said. 
. During the drive back to her 
house, Robson told detectives, "I'm 
like a Heidi Fleiss.7  
enough dirt on the girls to make 
prosecutors skeptical. Not only did 
some of the girls have issues with 
drugs or alcohol but also some had 
criminal records and other troubles, 
Epstein's legal team claimed. And at 
least one of them, they said, lied 
when she told police she was 
younger than 18 when she started 
performing massages for Epstein. 
After the meeting, prosecutors 
postponed their decision to take the 
case to a grand jury. 
In the following weeks, police 
received complaints that two of the 
victims or their families had been 
harassed or threatened. Epstein's 
legal team maintains that its private 
investigators did nothing illegal or 
unethical during their research. 
By then, relations between 
police and prosecutors were fraying. 
At a key meeting with prosecutors 
and the defense, Detective Joseph 
Recarey, the lead investigator, was a 
no-show, according to Epstein's 
attorney. 
"The embarrassment on the 
prosecutor's face was evident when 
the police officer never showed up 
for the meeting," attorney Jack 
Goldberger said. 
Later in April, Recarey walked 
into a prosecutor's office at the state 
attorney's office and learned the 
case was taking an unexpected turn. 
The prosecutor, Lanna 
Belohlavek, told Recarey the state 
attorney's office had offered Epstein 
a plea deal that would not require 
him to serve jail time or receive a 
felony conviction. 
Recarey told her he disapproved 
of the plea offer. 
The deal never came to pass, 
however. 
Future unclear after charge 
On May 1, the department asked 
prosecutors to approve warrants to 
arrest Epstein on four counts of 
unlawful sexual activity with a minor 
and to charge his personal assistant, 
Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged 
role in arranging the visits. Police

Read previous stories on the Epstein investig, 
math teacher at the prestigious 
Dalton School in Manhattan. 
The story goes that the father of 
one of Epstein's students was so 
impressed with the man that he put 
him in touch with a senior partner at 
Bear Stearns, the global investment 
bank and securities firm. 
In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a 
job at Bear Stearns. By the early 
1980s, he had started J. Epstein and 
Co. That is when he began making 
his millions in earnest 
Little is known or said about 
Epstein's business except this: He 
manages money for the extremely 
wealthy. He is said to handle 
accounts only of $1 billion or great-
er. 
It has been estimated he has 
roughly 15 clients, but their identi-
ties are the subject of only specula-
tion. All except for one: Leslie Wex-
ner, founder of The Limited retail 
chain and a former Palm Beacher 
who is said to have been a mentor to 
Epstein. 
Wexner sold Epstein one of his 
most lavish residences: a massive 
townhouse that dominates a block 
on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It 
is reported to have, among its finer 
features, closed-circuit television 
and a heated sidewalk to melt away 
fallen snow. 
That townhouse, thought to be 
the largest private residence in 
Manhattan, is only a piece of the 
extravagant world Epstein built over 
time. 
In New Mexico, he constructed a 
27,000-square-foot hilltop Mansion 
on a 10,000-acre ranch outside Santa 
Fe. Many believed it to be the largest 
home in the state. 
In Palm Beach, he bought a 
waterfront home on El Brillo Way. 
And he owns a 100-acre private 
island in the Virgin Islands. 
Perhaps as remarkable as his 
lavish homes is his extensive net-
work of friends and associates at the 
highest echelons of power. This 
includes not only socialites but also 
business tycoons, media moguls, 
politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-
winning scientists whose research 
he often funds. 
"Just Ince other people collect 
art, he collects scientists," said 
Martin Nowak, who directs the 
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics 
at Harvard University and was 
reportedly the recipient of a $30 
' million research donation from 
Epstein: 
Epstein is said to have 
befriended former Harvard Presi-
dent Larry Summers, prominent law 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald 
Trump and New Yarn Daily News 
Publisher Mott Zuckerman. 
And yet he managed for decades 
to maintain a low profile. He avoids 
eating out and was rarely photo-
' graphed. 
"The odd thing is I never met 
him," said Dominick Dunne, the 
famous chronicler of the trials and 
tribulations of the very rich. "I wasn't 
even aware of him," except for a 
Vanity Fair article. 
Epstein's friendship with Clinton 
has attracted the most attention. 
Epstein met Clinton as early as 
1995, when he paid tens of thou-
sands of dollars to join him at an 
intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm 
Beach. But from all appearances, 
they did not become close friends 
until after Clinton left the Oval Office 
and moved to New York. 
Epstein. has donated more than 
$100,000 to Democratic candidates' 
campaigns, including John Kerry's• 
 
presidential bid, the reelection 
campaign of New Mexico. Gov. BM 
Richardson and the Senate bids of 
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, Christopher Dodd and 
Charles Schumer. 
Powerful Mends and enemies 
A Vanity Fair profile found 
cracks in the veneer of Epstein's life 
story. The 2003 article said he left 
Bear Stearns in the wake of a federal 
probe and a possible Securities and 
Exchange Commission violation. It 
also pointed out that Citibank once 
sued him for defaulting on a $20 
million loan. 
The article suggested that one of 
his business mentors and previous 
employers was Steven Hoffenberg, 
now serving a prison term after 
"bilking investors out of more than 
$450 million in one of the largest 
Ponzi schemes in American histo-
rY%" As he amassed his wealth, 
Epstein made enemies in disputes 
both large and small. He sued the 
man who in 1990 sold him his 
multimillion-dollar Palm Beach 
home over a dispute about less than 
$16,000 in furnishings.

In October, police searched the

females, just as several of the girls 
had described in interviews. Hidden 
cameras were found in the garage 
area and inside a clock on Epstein's 
desk, alongside a girl's high school 
transcript 
Two of Epstein's former 
employees told investigators that 
young-looking girls showed up to 
perform massages two or three 
times a day when Epstein was in 
town. 
They said the girls were permit-
ted many indulgences. A chef 
cooked for them. Workers gave 
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time. 
One employee told detectives he 
was told to send a dozen roses to one 
teenage girl after a high school 
drama performance. Others were 
given rental cars. One, according to 
police, received a $200 Christmas 
bonus. 
The cops moved to cement their 
case. But as they tried to tighten the 
noose, they encountered other 
forces at work. 
In Orlando they interviewed a 
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened 
between her and Epstein. They 
asked her whether she had spoken 
to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-
vate investigator had asked her the 
same questions. 
When they subpoenaed one of 
Epstein's former employees, he told 
them the same thing. He and a pri-
vate eye had met at a restaurant days 
earlier to go over what the man 
would tell investigators. 
Detectives received complaints 
that private eyes were posing as 
police officers. When they told 
Epstein's local attorney, Guy Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked 
for Roy Black, the high-powered 
Miami lawyer who has defended the 
likes of Rush Limbaugh and William 
Kennedy Smith. 
While the private eyes were 
conducting a parallel investigation, 
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro-
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach 
with information about the girls. 
From their own profiles on the pop-
ular Web site MySpace.com, he 
obtained copies of their discussions 
about their use of alcohol and mari-
juana. 
He took his research to a meet-
ing with prosecutors in early 2006, 
where he sought to cast doubt on the 
teens' reliability. 
 
The private eyes had dug up

son, the self-described Heidi Fleiss, 
with lewd and lascivious acts. 
By then, the department was 
frustrated with the way the state 
attorney's office had handled the 
rase. On the same dal the warrants 
were requested, Palm Beach Police 
Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter 
to State Attorney Barry Krischer 
suggesting he disqualify himself 
from the case if he would not act. 
Two weeks later, Recarey was 
told that prosecutors had decided 
once again to take tie case to the 
grand jury. 
It is not known how many of the 
girls testified before tie grand jury. 
But Epstein's defenseteam said one 
girl who was subpoened — the one 
who said she had serial intercourse 
with Epstein — nevershowed 
The grand jury's indictment was 
handed down in July. It was not the 
one the police department had 
wanted. 
Instead of being slapped with a 
charge of unlawful sexual activity 
with a minor, Epstein was charged 
with one count of felony solicitation 
of prostitution, which carries a 
maximum penalty of five years in 
prison. He was booked into the Palm 
Beach County Jail early July 23 and 
released hours later. 
Epstein's legal team "doesn't 
dispute that he had girls over for 
massages," Goldberger said. But he 
said their claims that they had sex-
ual encounters with him lack credi-
bility. 
"They are incapable of being 
believed," he said. "They had crimi-
nal records. They had accusations of 
theft made against them by their 
employers. There was evidence of 
drug use by some of them." 
What remains for Epstein is yet 
to be seen. 
The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment has asked the FBI to investi-
gate the case. It also has returned 
the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004. 
In New York, candidates for 
governor and state attorney general 
have vowed to return a total of at 
least $60,000 in campaign contribu-
tions from Epstein. Meanwhile, 
Epstein's powerful friends have 
remained silent as tabloids and 
Internet blogs feast on the public 
details of the police investigation. 
Goldberger maintains Epstein's 
innocence but says the legal team 
has not ruled out a future plea deal. 
He insists Epstein will emerge in the 
end with his reputation untarnished. 
"He will recover from this," he 
said.
