Already thinking about 
Hi Jay -- Yes, I am. 
I have been spending some quality time with Title 18 looking for 
misdeffl€anors. 
Do you want to take a look at 18 USC 403, 18 USC 1512(d), and 47 use 
223(a)(l)(B) and we can talk about them tomorro~? 
I know that someone mentioned there being 
~ivity on an airplane, I just want to make sure that there is factual basis tor the plea 
.. 
t the agents can confirm. 
I'm not sure exactly where I will be tomorrow morning, so is it alright if 1 call you? 
Have a good evening.

Draft Agreements? 
Hi Jay 
I was hoping there would be things for me to read this moming, but I will try to remain patient. 
I believe there are only two types of agreements that would apply to this case: ( 1) a plea agreement to a federal 
charge or charges; and (2) a non-prosecution agreement (which is really a deferred prosecution agreement 
because the defendant agrees that if he violates the agreement, the U.S. can prosecute him). 
A plea agreement is part of the court file. It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the 
Clerk's Office to obtain a copy. 
A non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our 
case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute 
without compulsory process. 
On the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our 
discussions and the agents' observations of•••■ We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of 
those facts. On a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private investigators 
followed-father, forcing him off the road. Or, if there is something more recent related to any -
• 
we could consider that 
ope that helps.
