Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Reply in Support of Her 
Motion for Pretrial Release
The Government’s Response underscores why this Court should
order bail for Ghislaine Maxwell so that she can prepare for trial. The
court below erred in accepting the Government’s conclusory proffer
without any actual evidence. And the conditions of her confinement make
it impossible for her to effectively prepare her defense. The Government
concedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community, and her
proposed bail package demonstrates that she is not a risk of flight.
Accordingly, she should be released on bail.
At the very least, this matter should be remanded to the district
court to conduct a real bail hearing to (1) test the actual strength of the
Government’s case, and (2) determine whether Ms. Maxwell should be
granted temporary release so that she can effectively prepare for trial,
which she cannot do under the current conditions of confinement.
Relying almost entirely on a regurgitation of quotations from the
lower court (the first 26 of the 43-paragraph pleading is labeled “Facts”),
only ten paragraphs, labeled “Discussion,” even attempt to address Ms.
Maxwell’s arguments. As much as the Government would prefer that Ms.
Maxwell not have a fair fight, this Court must level the playing field so
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page2 of 30

3
that the presumption of innocence is more than mere words on a page.
This Reply responds to the arguments the Government does raise:
1. 
The Court did not conduct a “lengthy bail hearing.” Resp.¶2.
The transcript of the video arraignment and bail hearing spans only 91
pages, with the bail arguments on pages 22-79.  The Government did not
present any actual evidence at this brief hearing. Br.7-8,19-21. During the
bail hearing, each time the Government mentioned the strength of its
case, it cited to the Indictment.  See, e.g., Ex.D, p.24 (“Turning first to the
... strength of the evidence, the indictment in this case arises ... . The
indictment further charges that ...”); pg. 25 (“The indictment makes plain
... it was an ongoing scheme ... Given the strength of the government’s
evidence ... there is an incredibly strong incentive for the defendant to flee
...”).  The court erred in agreeing that the Indictment itself demonstrates
strength. Id. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the
evidence proffered by the government in assessing risk of flight. The
government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.
Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the indictment
describes ...”).  At no point did the Government introduce or even proffer
any actual evidence.   
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page3 of 30

The defense has been forced to asked for a continuance of the July
1
trial because of the expansion of the conspiracy time period. Ex.O. If the
trial is delayed and Ms. Maxwell is not released on bail, she will be
further prejudiced with the inhumane conditions of confinement and the
inability to aid her defense.
4
The Government makes much of the fact that its Indictment is
“speaking.”  But speaking or not, an indictment is not a substitute for
evidence and cannot be used as proof that the case is strong.  If that were
true, then every single case would be strong because in every case there
is an indictment.  
2.
Similarly, the “additional charges” do not “strengthen the
evidence against Maxwell” and do not “further support Judge Nathan’s
detention orders.” Resp.¶6, n.2.  The new charges are allegations, nothing
more.  Piling allegation on allegation and then calling it proof does not
make it so. Allegations are not evidence. Moreover, these charges will
require Ms. Maxwell to spend more time with her lawyers, not less, and
further illustrate why bail is necessary.   
1
3.
Contrary to the Government’s assertion, “[e]ach witness’s
testimony” is not “corroborated by that of other victim-witnesses.”
Resp.¶9.  The Government continues to press the false point that the mere
number of accusers provides corroboration for the accusers. To the
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page4 of 30

5
contrary.  Not a single on of the anonymous accusers saw or heard what
purportedly happened to the other accusers.  Not a single one of the
anonymous accusers will be able to corroborate the 25-year old stories of
the other accusers. Indeed, their stories are contradictory, not
corroborating.  At a real hearing, the defense will demonstrate that each
of the witness’ stories has dramatically changed over the years.  At first,
none of the anonymous accusers even mentioned Ms. Maxwell.  As they
hired the same law firm, sought money and fame, joined a movement, and
only after Epstein died, did the accusers start to point the finger at Ms.
Maxwell.  Far from corroboration, this is fabrication.  The district judge
erred in relying on the Indictment as proof that the Government’s case is
strong.
4.
Because there was no meaningful proffer, the Government’s
reliance on United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir. 2000)
and United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986), is
misplaced. Resp.¶34.  In fact, those cases highlight the court’s error.  In
LaFontaine, for example, the bail revocation hearing lasted three days
where the government’s proffer included providing tape recordings,
transcripts, and an affidavit for the court.  No such evidentiary proffer
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page5 of 30

6
occurred here.  The LaFontaine Court explained that “while the
informality of bail hearings serves the demands of speed, the … district
judge must also ensure the reliability of the evidence, ‘by selectively
insisting upon the production of the underlying evidence of evidentiary
sources where their accuracy is in question.’” Id. at 131 (quoting Martir,
782 F.2d at 1147).  And in Martir, this Court recognized the “high stakes”
involved in a detention hearing and explained that the power afforded to
the lower courts “should always be exercised ‘with the recognition that a
pretrial detention hearing may restrict for a significant time the liberty
of a presumably innocent person.’” 782 F.2d at 1145 (internal citations
omitted).  It then criticized the government’s proffer as stating in “the
most general and conclusory terms what it hoped to provide,” for failing
to submit any “independent evidence, such as tapes, documents, or
photographs,” and for failing to furnish any testimony or affidavits.  Id. at
1147.  Sounds familiar.  Unlike Martir, where this Court found that it
could not reverse because the defense “did not challenge the proffer in any
way,” Ms. Maxwell absolutely challenged the flimsy proffer from the
initial bail hearing through three renewals.  Instead of properly putting
the Government to the test, the court blindly, uncritically, and
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page6 of 30

7
erroneously adopted its conclusory proffer.
5.
Ms. Maxwell’s intention to evade the media does not even
marginally amount to risk of flight.  Resp.¶33.  The Government does not
dispute that the media placed a bounty on Ms. Maxwell or that she was
being stalked by them before her arrest.  Of course she took measures to
protect herself and her family, just as government lawyers and judges do
when their safety is at issue. Ms. Maxwell was at her home in the United
States. The Government admits that it knew where she was. It had such
confidence that it could arrest her whenever it chose that it orchestrated
her arrest to coincide with a press conference replete with incendiary
demonstrative aids.  And it is worth repeating that the Government does
not claim that Ms. Maxwell – a 59-year old woman with no prior criminal
history – is a danger to the community.  She is no monster, but she is
being treated like one because of the “Epstein effect.”
6.
The Government’s contention that Ms. Maxwell receives more
time than other inmates at MDC to “review her discovery” and
“communicate with her attorneys” does not prove anything about whether
she is actually able to effectively prepare her defense.  Ms. Maxwell needs
more time with her lawyers and discovery than almost any other MDC
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page7 of 30

To illustrate, for Ms. Maxwell to review the 2.7 million pages, she
2
would have to do it, page by page, on a computer screen.  If she spent only
1 minute per page, it would take 45,000 hours or 3,750 days (at 12 hours
a day), without taking any notes, without discussing a single page with
her lawyers, and not including the discovery that is on the way.  Although
the Government labels this new discovery “non-testifying witness
discovery,” it really is Brady material which severely undermines the
already weak case. 
8
inmate, few of which are preparing for trial.  Over 97% of criminal
defendants plead guilty and, therefore, need far less time with their
lawyers.  Of the remaining 3% who do proceed to trial, the vast majority
are out on bond.  For those few in custody, how many involve anonymous
accusations that are decades old and 2.7 million pages?  And how often is
2
such a defendant forced to prepare her case during a pandemic where
in-person lawyer visits are unsafe and impractical? It is no wonder that
courts around the country are ordering temporary release under § 3142(i)
for the few defendants who are trying to prepare for trial during the
pandemic.  
The Government’s weak response is that Ms. Maxwell only
mentioned temporary release at the first bail hearing.  The Government
suggests waiver, without saying it. Nonsense. Ms. Maxwell has repeatedly
pressed her inability to effectively prepare her defense, which is properly
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page8 of 30

9
before this Court.
7.
Ms. Maxwell is not suggesting that “any defendant in a case
with voluminous discovery must be released on bail to prepare for trial.”
Resp.¶40.  Her case and situation is unique.  Other defendants may pose
a danger to the community.  The Government concedes that she does not.
Other defendants may not be U.S. citizens.  She is.  Other defendants may
not have strong U.S. connections.  Ms. Maxwell has lived here for 30
years, has a husband and step-children here, and has two sisters who are
U.S. citizens and live here. Other defendants may not have pledged almost
all of their assets or offer to have a monitor track her expenses.  Ms.
Maxwell has. Other defendants may not be willing to renounce their
foreign citizenship. She is. Other defendants may have prior convictions.
She does not.  But other defendants have no connection to Jeffrey Epstein,
and she does. Although unstated, that old connection is the driving factor
for detention, and that is error.
8.
The Government says that the district judge has “closely
monitored” her conditions of confinement.  Unfortunately, that is not
accurate.  The District Court accepted, without any real inquiry, the
self-serving Government letters. These letters describe a “prison
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page9 of 30

10
paradise,” not one of the most notorious prisons in America.  A “day room.”
Two computers. Recreation. Eye masks. But the Government’s description
of Ms. Maxwell’s conditions is not true.  For example, she has no eye
mask.  The guards flash lights in her cell every 15 minutes for no reason
so she tries as best as she can to shield her eyes with a towel that is not
secured and not effective against the unwelcome beams.  Even the
Government does not dispute that Ms. Maxwell is in de facto solitary
confinement.  It does not dispute that she has no surface to write on in her
isolation cell.  It does not dispute that there is often cloudy, obviously
unsanitary, water in the jail.  It does not dispute that she is being forced
to prepare for this trial with a computer that cannot do research and
cannot search documents. Attached as Exhibit P, is a response to the
latest Government letter, which outlines her actual conditions.  It is
inconceivable that the government lawyers or its witnesses could prepare
for trial under these conditions. 
It is painfully apparent that the two sides are far apart on how Ms.
Maxwell is being treated. The Government’s letters, however, are based
on multiple layers of hearsay – prison guards to the prison lawyer to the
prosecutor, which get summarized in an unsworn letter to the court.  No
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page10 of 30

11
affidavits at all, let along from anyone with actual knowledge, were
submitted to the court. And the judge has never had an evidentiary
hearing about the conditions.  
In its most recent letter, the Government contends that Ms.
Maxwell’s allegation of abuse by the prison guards is unfounded because
the Bureau of Prisons has reviewed a video of the incident and has
concluded that there is no abuse.  This self-serving proclamation is no
substitute for evidence. The prosecutors who filed the letter do not even
claim to have watched the video.  The Government should produce it for
the court and defense to review. The court should conduct a hearing to
determine what actually happened.  The Government professes to believe
women, but only when those women are on their side, despite their
inconsistent and self-contradictory statements about old, uncorroborated
allegations. When it is Ms. Maxwell who has been abused, the
Government wants to believe only the abusers who say they did no such
thing and without watching the actual video.  It seems like the only rule
is to get Ms. Maxwell at all costs. And it seems that a conviction is not
even enough for the Government – it wants to go so far as to humiliate
Ms. Maxwell with false statements about the cleanliness of her cell.  See
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page11 of 30

12
Gov’tEx. (April 6, 2021 letter, n.2).  But as Ms. Maxwell explained, the
Government’s narrative is total fiction – the unsanitary conditions are
caused by other inmates and guards, not Ms. Maxwell.  
9.
The Government also makes much of Ms. Maxwell’s
vaccination.  Again this demonstrates a gross double standard. Imagine
if the defense had publicly filed medical information about the accusers.
There would be hell to pay. The Government insists on secrecy and
redactions when discussing their witnesses, and will not even reveal their
names. Yet it freely discloses private information in violation of HIPAA
about Ms. Maxwell in public filings. 
In any event, whether Ms. Maxwell is vaccinated or not does not
help her search documents on an ancient computer or give her access to
a printer or allow her to meet with her lawyers (who would still need to
come into the jail and interact with numerous other prisoners and guards
who have not been vaccinated).  Ms. Maxwell’s bail motion is not based on
her risk of contracting COVID.  Her vaccination status is irrelevant.
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page12 of 30

13
CONCLUSION
Ms. Maxwell should be released.  The allegations against her are
weak, she is not a risk of flight, and her appearance at trial is assured by
an unprecedented bail package.  In the meantime, she cannot effectively
prepare for  trial under these truly appalling conditions.
The Government’s tactic in this appeal, and in the court below, is
transparent – it is “trust us.”  Trust our proffer on the evidence because
we indicted her (and this case relates to Jeffrey Epstein).  Trust us when
we say her conditions are fine because the Bureau of Prisons says they are
fine (and we can’t have another Jeffrey Epstein situation).  The court
below clearly erred, however, in just trusting the Government without any
actual evidence and without a real hearing, notwithstanding Jeffrey
Epstein.  As much as the Government would like this case to be the
Jeffrey Epstein show, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein.
Ms. Maxwell understands that she and the Government are not
going to agree on the facts.  This is an adversary system, of course.  But
in that circumstance, there must be an adversarial hearing where Ms.
Maxwell can demonstrate that the Government’s case – based on old,
anonymous accusations – is weak.  There must be an adversarial hearing
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page13 of 30

14
where she can demonstrate that her conditions of confinement make
preparing for trial impossible.  There must be an adversarial hearing
where she can challenge any contrary evidence.  At the very least, this
matter should be remanded to the trial court to conduct such proceedings.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
We write in reply to the government's April 9th letter opposing a trial continuance. 
TI1e defense has been steadfastly and diligently preparing for a July 12th trial based on tl1e 
01iginal indictment, a date set on the condition that there would be no superseding indictment 
adding substantive charges. TI1e recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that 
agreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand tl1e relevant time pe1iod from a four-
year period in the 1990s to an eleven-year period stretching from 1994 to 2004. TI1ese additions 
significantly alter the scope of the government's case and necessarily shift the focus of the 
defense's trial prepai·ation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of 
the three accusers from the 1990s, as we have been doing, the defense will now have to spend 
considerable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely 
different time pe1iod involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that 
COVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation. 
We do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance. TI1e 
government beai·s responsibility for this need, having filed a late-breaking superseding 
indictrnent based on a witness who has been known to the govermnent since the Florida 

Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page18 of 30
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 202 Filed 04/15/21 Page 2 of 8

investigation in 2007 (see Dkt. 199 at 1-2), long before commencing this prosecution against Ms. 
Maxwell. We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a 
substantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining. 
Government Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable 
l11e government implies that the assumptions underlying the July 12 trial date are 
irrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was "ongoing." But 
"ongoing investigation" does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally 
charged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on 
distinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original 
charges. This is not a situation where the government's "ongoing investigation" has yielded, for 
example, a new ove1t act to an existing conspiracy. l11e government has effectively added a 
brand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against 
Ms. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed, 
by its own admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2020 
interview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding 
indictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any 
additional time to prepai·e to defend against tl1is revised prosecution. l11e government's double-
standai·d approach is simply wrong. l11e defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense 
investigation and must have adequate time to do so. 
l11e govermnent's recent production of 3500 material for non-testifying witnesses 
underscores the significant ainount of time that tl1e defense will need to investigate. On April 13, 
2021 , in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 20,000 
pages of interview notes, rep01ts and other mate1ials related to 226 sepai·ate witnesses whom the 
government does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these 
2 

Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page19 of 30
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 202 Filed 04/15/21 Page 3 of 8

materials in the MDC. Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the 
materials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpat01y or 
othe1wise favorable infonnation for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to 
investigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as pait of the defense case. Even if defense 
counsel were to attempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and 
conduct any necessa1y follow-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time 
to complete. Tims, while we appreciate receiving these mate1ials, the disclosure has not 
decreased the ainount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it. 
It is also disingenuous for the government to ai·gue that because it previously provided 
discove1y regai·ding the new chai·ges no additional time is required to prepai·e the defense of the 
new indictment. When the pai·ties were 01iginally negotiating a discovery schedule for the 
01iginal indictment, the govermnent represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of 
caution, a significant ainount of discovery from Epstein's seized electronic devices that 
contained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell's case. l11e government 
reiterated this point in its November 6, 2020 letter to the Court requesting additional time to 
finish producing discove1y. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 ("l O Jf the approximately 1.2 million documents, 
only a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the 
chai·ges in the current indictment."). l11ese devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material, 
viltually none of which pertained to the time pe1iod of the 01iginal indictment. Now that the 
superseding indictment has expanded the time pe1iod of the alleged conduct well into the 2000s, 
the 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant ai·e now pertinent, requiling re-review and 
analysis. 1 
1 The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices 
included forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.

LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEI/\\ 
l11e defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of 
superseding indictment by using te1m searches and key word searches. But given the nature of 
the discove1y, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of 
documents it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discove1y contains 
approximately 214,000 photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 250,000 
documents where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. l110se materials are not susceptible 
to text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms. 
Maxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new 
charges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks. 
We have already experienced the difficulties ofreviewing photographs with Ms. 
Maxwell. Over the past tlu·ee days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view 
with Ms. Maxwell. As pait of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hai·d 
drive to review approximately 2,100 "Highly Confidential" photographs tl1at were not produced 
to us in discove1y. Because of technical issues witl1 tl1e laptop, we still have not completed tl1e 
review. 
l11e re-review of tl1e discove1y will not be limited to tl1e materials on tl1e seized devices. 
l11e discove1y also includes numerous bank records and phone records tl1at date from tl1e 2000s 
and later. None oftl1ese records were from tl1e 1990s and were therefore lai·gely iITelevant to tl1e 
chai·ged crimes. However, witl1 tl1e expansion of tl1e chai·ges to include tl1e tiine period of tl1e 
2000s, tl1e defense will need to carefully analyze tl1ese records for relevant payments and phone 
calls, which will, again, take a significant amount of tiine. 
l11e government also attempts to justify its delay in seeking tl1e superseding indictment 
due to the investigative challenges posed by COVID. l11e government has been investigating for 
The forensic images contain thousands of individual documents.

years and elected to commence prosecution of Ms. Maxwell in the throes of the pandemic. All 
counsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance. 
TI1e government's challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense. 
Defending quarter-centmy-old allegations has required investigation across this countly and 
around the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same effo1ts and diligence. 
It is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the 
indictlnent and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not ilmnune 
to the ilnpact of the pandemic. 
A Trial Continuance is Necessary 
While the government's offer to provide discove1y highlights and its representation that it 
will sti·eamline its case to prilnaiily focus on the four accusers ai·e helpful, these gestures do not 
eliminate the need for a continuance. As set fo1th above, the government's hyperbolic clailn that 
it can ' ensure that the defense will be fully prepai·ed to proceed to tiial on July 12, 2021" (Govt 
lti· at 4-5) ignores the reality that tilne is needed to: 
• 
supplement pending pretlial motions; 
• 
c1itically review voluminous discove1y produced in November 2020 that the 
government represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell; 
• 
re-review discove1y for the new tilne period and chai·ges; 
• 
cmmnence new investigations based on the new chai·ges and the govermnent's 
disclosure of 3500 mate1ial for non-testifying witnesses; and 
• 
refocus ti·ial prepai·ation and sti·ategy. 
TI1e govermnent 01iginally represented to the Court and counsel that this tiial would last 
two weeks. The government now predicts the ti·ial will last a month. TI1e estilnates ai·e mere 
guesses which do not factor in tilne-consuming COVID jmy selection in a high-publicity case 
necessitating sensitive and personal disclosures by prospective jurors or the presentation of 
defense evidence. In the absence of disclosure of the number and identity of government tiial

witnesses, including potential FRE 404(b) witnesses, and trial exhibits, the government's 
speculation about the length of the trial is entirely one-sided and lacking in any reliable estimate 
of a defense case. TI1e government's April 12th disclosure of inf01mation and statements 
regarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory info1mation requires intensive investigation. 
TI1e delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial 
severely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments. 
To assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately dete1mining the length of tiial, Ms. 
Maxwell requests that the Comt order the government to disclose: a list of tiial witnesses, its 
alleged FRE 404(b) evidence, and a list of potential tiial exhibits. With this inf01mation the 
Court and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises. 
At the barest minimum, we require a 90-day continuance. In reliance on the fnm tiial 
date set by the CoUit at Ms. Maxwell's airnigmnent on July 14th, 2020, counsel p1io1itized the 
July 12, 2021 tiial date, cleaiing and scheduling our calendai·s to avoid interference. Counsel 
have other clients and fnm commitlnents to tly cases specifically scheduled to follow the 
smmner ti·ial of this case. TI1ese co1mnit1nents make us unavailable from September tlu·ough 
December, and possibly spill over into J anuaiy, make ti·ying tl1is case unlikely, if not impossible, 
before 1nid-Januaiy. We ai·e exti·emely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one 
which will prolong Ms. Maxwell's 1niserable and punishing detention, but tl1e need for ti.me to 
properly prepai·e Ms. Maxwell's defense as a result of tl1e additional chai·ges requires us to do so, 
causing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to tllis request. 
In addition, motion heaiings, in ii.mine motion practice, and any litigation regai·ding 
expe1t witnesses have not yet c01mnenced, and issues regai·dingjmy selection, including but not 
limited to a jUiy questionnaire, have not yet been settled. Yesterday, we met witl1 tl1e

government in person to confer on a briefmg schedule for supplemental pretrial motions, as well 
as other deadlines, which we are prepared to discuss with the Comt at the arraignment. 
TI1e government's revised trial estimate from two to four weeks remains umealistic and 
does not include jruy selection, which will take longer than usual in this media-saturated case. 
We oppose advancing jmy selection beyond early distribution of questionnaires to prospective 
jurors. Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July 12th, carving off any ti.me 
required for trial preparation is unwa1Tanted and unfair. 
A continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. TI1e new charges 
up the ante and double Ms. Maxwell's sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance 
undercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A 
continuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and 
necessruy in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a misca1·1iage of justice. 
Despite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell 
A delay of the July 12th tiial especially one that accommodates counsel's other tiial 
schedules - has a direct and delete1ious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued 
detention, the details of which ru·e well known to the Court. In addition to her prolonged 
detention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media repo1ting which impacts the ability to seat 
fair and imprutial jurors. 
On Ap1il 26th, Second Circuit will heru· oral ru·grunent on Ms. Maxwell's bail appeal and 
may moot any need for a fu1ther bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her 1ight to

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
 
 
 
                    S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
 
The government’s letter of April 6th is yet another regurgitation of its previous letters 
regarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement.  No matter how often the government tries 
to present Ms. Maxwell’s detention as superior to other inmates, it continues to miss the mark.  
We stand by our previous responses and reiterate that Ms. Maxwell’s detention is unwarranted 
and overly restrictive.  It is tantamount to “pay-it-forward” punishment served pretrial.  
The government’s letter provides the opportunity to flush out the persistent unsanitary 
conditions at the MDC, which long predate Ms. Maxwell’s detention. This past weekend there 
was a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s unit necessitating guards to flush pipes by 
pouring water down open drains in an effort to trap and disperse gaseous emissions. As guards 
explained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system 
goes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms. 
Maxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflowing of toilets in the cellblock 
above. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell 
and, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems. At times, the 
stench is apparent upon entering the visiting area. Of the many defense counsel who visit

regularly, I challenge the government to identify anyone that would risk their health by drinking 
the tap water. Even the guards resort to drinking bottled water.  
Blaming Ms. Maxwell for the filth of her severely restricted environment is utterly 
misplaced. To suggest she willingly lives in squalor is absurd. In an effort to wield power, the 
guards use cleaning as a punishment. The MDC - especially the East Building where Ms. 
Maxwell is held– is permeated with mold and vermin. Cockroaches and rodents are plentiful and 
glue tracks have been placed in Ms. Maxwell’s day area to help remediate the problem. 
While HEPA filters may improve the safety of the legal visiting rooms – characterized by 
an HVAC inspector as “a death trap” – in-person visiting with Ms. Maxwell is uncomfortable 
and unproductive. Relegated to a small “fishbowl” where chairs abut glass walls and a table, 
with no room in between, Ms. Maxwell and counsel are forced to wedge their bodies into chairs. 
There is no opportunity to view electronic discovery or exchange documents; and speaking while 
wearing a face mask while crammed on either side of a plexiglass divider under surveillance of 
three guards and a handheld camera places a chill on any free exchange of confidential 
information. While video conferencing has facilitated on-going communication between Ms. 
Maxwell and counsel, her request for a legal call to confer with counsel regarding pretrial 
motions was denied. 
Ms. Maxwell’s health is deteriorating.  She has not experienced sunshine and fresh air for 
the past eight months.  Referring to an interior gated pen where Ms. Maxwell can exercise (and 
be subjected to even more searches) as the “outside” is a misnomer. Barely a breeze permeates 
that area.   
Medical staff monitor Ms. Maxwell’s health by recording her weight in her medical 
chart.  Guards declined Ms. Maxwell’s request to know her weight, claiming they cannot look it

up because it is part of her medical record, which is protected by the American Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act Health Information Policy (HIPAA).  She is weighed while 
clothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set 
above five pounds.  Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning.  The guards are far from 
qualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.  
Releasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without 
inmate consent is a HIPAA violation.  By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the 
MDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s letter. Requesting 
medical attention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk.  We request that the 
Court order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such 
information falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in 
Criminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of 
discovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s 
right to privacy.  
The incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her 
isolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and 
investigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating 
team that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell 
for the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in 
front of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief, 
the camera was not recording at that time.  The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by 
citing a video. We request that the Court direct the government to provide defense counsel with 
that video. In response to any misconduct of guards,  the standard reply is that “the matter will be

4 
taken seriously,” and just like the majority of complaints filed by inmates, the facility refuses to 
provide results of this and other inquiries.   
The mail and food issues persist.  Even a Federal Express envelope from the government 
was not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a discovery disc that 
was unreadable.  In mid-March, she received a copy of the New York Times issued in October.  
Any claim that Ms. Maxwell deletes CorrLinks emails, which is disputed, does little to erase the 
fact that the MDC violated its own policy by prematurely deleting Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails.  
That her food is not heated in a thermal oven does little to explain why she was given a salad 
containing mold earlier this week. 
Ms. Maxwell does not have an eye mask; she’s not even provided a suitable face mask. 
She covers her eyes with a towel to shield them from glaring overhead lighting that she cannot 
turn off and from flashlights pointed into her cell every 15 minutes during the night.  That Ms. 
Maxwell chooses not to respond to guards during the nighttime is no indication that she is 
engaged in restful sleep; rather, it’s a respite from having to engage with them. 
 
No amount of gloss put on Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement can erase the fact 
that she remains in de facto solitary confinement, over-managed by multiple guards, and 
surveilled by multiple cameras 24 hours per day.  The computer equipment provided remains 
inadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not 
conducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark, 
save, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial.  The Court need only 
imagine how the government would respond if this was a 25-year-old document-driven fraud 
case.

The Court’s request for updates concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement 
does little to improve her situation.  Quite the contrary. The government’s update letters are 
anything but helpful: They fuel media attention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The 
government’s attempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of 
public opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury. 
The government’s review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms. 
Maxwell’s inappropriate detention.  If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other 
defendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail. 
It is debatable whether the public has a “right to know” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions 
of confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The 
government safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release 
any unless mandated by statute or court order.  Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell 
the same treatment. 
Should the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be 
limited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate redaction.

Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bond 
 
Although this Court denied Ghislaine Maxwell’s motion for bond 
(see Ex. A, Order, April 27, 2021), it appeared concerned with the 
conditions of her confinement during oral argument and instructed Ms. 
Maxwell that “[t]o the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her 
sleeping conditions, such request should be addressed to the District 
Court.”  (Id.). 
Ms. Maxwell did just that, explaining again to the trial judge the 
grueling conditions of her confinement, which includes shining a 
flashlight in Ms. Maxwell’s eyes every 15 minutes, over the past 318 days 
in solitary confinement, even though she is not suicidal and even though 
no other inmate suffers such abuse. Ex. C, Doc. 256. The government 
responded, Ex. D, and although it previously intimated that Ms. Maxwell 
might be suicidal (she’s not), it now said that the sleep deprivation was 
justified because she is housed alone, because of the nature of the 
charges, and because the case is high-profile. Not one of these reasons 
makes any sense upon any examination. The government did not provide 
an affidavit from anyone at the jail or explain why depriving Ms. Maxwell 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page3 of 14

 
2 
 
of sleep would alleviate her stress instead of exacerbate it. Ms. Maxwell 
replied. Ex. E, Doc. 272. 
 The district court then issued an order saying that it would not tell 
the Bureau of Prisons what to do but “admonishe[d] the MDC and the 
Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those 
security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her safety and 
security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with 
the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” Ex. B, Doc. 282.  
But Ms. Maxwell is not being treated like any other detainee. And 
the horrific conditions make it impossible to prepare for trial.  
Accordingly, we renew our motion for bond and seek relief from this 
Court. Ms. Maxwell simply wants a fair opportunity to fight the charges 
against her at trial.   
Currently, she (1) can’t sleep because the guards wake her every 15 
minutes; (2) oftentimes can’t drink the water because it is brown and 
contains particles; (3) can’t meet in person with her lawyers because the 
guards use a handheld camera to video and audio tape record the 
meetings; (4) can’t manage the smell of overflowing sewage that comes 
up from the drain in her unit; (5) can’t keep the guards from seizing and 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page4 of 14

 
3 
 
going through her attorney-client materials; and (6) can’t search, print, 
highlight, or sort the discovery because the “computer” she was given was 
stripped down and does not have the proper software or hardware 
capabilities. The truth is that Ms. Maxwell is not being treated in a 
humane fashion and cannot prepare for trial under these horrific 
conditions. She has been in solitary confinement with no sleep for almost 
a year. The presumption of innocence has been turned on its head. This 
Court should either order her temporary release under 18 U.S.C. 3142(i) 
or remand this matter and order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary 
hearing on the conditions of her confinement.  
It is important to underscore that the government has made a 
number of representations to the trial court and to this Court about the 
conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention that have proven to be false. 
1. 
Government misrepresentation to the district court: “The 
defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance 
caused by the flashlight [every fifteen minutes].” Doc. 196 (April 6, 2021, 
gov’t letter to district court). But the truth is that she has no “eye mask” 
and the government has now admitted that eye masks are “contraband” 
in the jail and that she cannot have one. Doc. 270 (May 5, 2021, gov’t 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page5 of 14

 
4 
 
letter to district court) (“MDC legal counsel has informed the government 
that the defendant cannot be provided with an eye mask.”). So Ms. 
Maxwell tries to shield her eyes with a sock or towel. Trying to sleep with 
an unsecured sock over your eyes in an attempt to shield yourself from 
flashlights searches every 15 minutes makes restful sleep impossible. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The above picture shows how Ghislaine Maxwell looked before her 
arrest in July 2020 (left) and how she looks now after 10 debilitating 
months of tortuous conditions at MDC Brooklyn where, just as an 
example, she is not permitted to sleep. Ex. C, Doc. 256.

Government misrepresentation to this Court during oral 
argument when asked if shining lights in Ms. Maxwell’s face every fifteen 
minutes during the night was routine: “My understanding, Your Honor, 
is that that is a routine; it is routine by BOP officials.”  But then in a 
letter to the district court, the government admitted that Ms. Maxwell is 
the only inmate who receives these targeted flashlight checks every 15 
minutes. Doc. 270 (“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen 
minutes [only for Ms. Maxwell] because the defendant, while not on 
suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule.”).  
 
In a response that would make Orwell’s Ministry of Truth proud, 
the government tries to spin this and argue that other inmates are also 
periodically checked throughout the night.  Doc. 270 (stating – without 
an affidavit or other actual sworn testimony – that in general population, 
checks are usually done about once an hour).   
 
But try as it might, the government cannot escape the bottom line 
that Ms. Maxwell is the only person who is treated this way and wakened 
every 15 minutes while in solitary confinement. In fact, the government 
then tries to justify the treatment by saying – again without support or 
an affidavit – that even though Ms. Maxwell is not suicidal, she should 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page7 of 14

 
6 
 
be singled out in this way because she is alone, the nature of the charges, 
and that this is high profile case. But those reasons, individually or 
collectively, do not justify torturing someone by depriving them of sleep.  
Nevertheless, the district judge did not conduct a hearing or otherwise 
question BOP. It simply allowed the government to file a letter saying 
that this is what was relayed to the government from the jail lawyer from 
the jail guards. Even if that hearsay was true (which should be 
questioned based on other representations made by BOP to the 
government to the court), it is not at all sufficient for this type of 
treatment. 
 
3. 
Government misrepresentation to the district court: Ms. 
Maxwell “caused [her] cell to smell” by not flushing the toilet. Doc. 196, 
n.2 (April 6, 2021, gov’t letter to district court). This claim is absurd, of 
course, and was again made without any sworn statement. Ms. Maxwell 
responded and explained that the smell of sewage was caused by the 
conditions in MDC and not by her.   
 
This was recently corroborated by another MDC inmate, Tiffany 
Days, who explained to Judge McMahon the sorts of conditions that are 
present at MDC: “I also survived the disgusting feces flood that we were 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page8 of 14

 
7 
 
actually told to clean with our own hands. It was humiliating. Floating, 
dead water bugs, mice, chunks of defecation coming out of the pipes and 
urine-filled water gushing all through the area. The water was as high 
as my ankles, and the smell was as bad. It was so bad, the inmates were 
vomiting due to nausea. Chunks of feces. And officers telling us that we 
had to clean it and clean it quick because lunch was on the way.”  She 
continued: “MCC and MDC are the most degrading and humiliating 
memories of my life. I will hold onto these memories forever, but these 
memories are my motivation to stay out of trouble, your Honor.” United 
States v. Tiffany Days, April 29, 2021, which can be accessed at: 
https://tinyurl.com/ytf8cyw5.  The judge in that case was upset, finding: 
“it is the finding of this Court that the conditions to which [Tiffany Days] 
was subjected are as disgusting, inhuman as anything I’ve heard about 
in any Colombian prison, but more so because we’re supposed to be better 
than that.”  See transcript of sentencing hearing, United States v. Tiffany

BOP false accusation to the district court concerning Ms. 
Maxwell’s lawyers: “Those [privileged] materials that defense counsel 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page9 of 14

 
8 
 
gave to Ms. Maxwell contrary to MDC Brooklyn’s legal visit procedures 
were confiscated by staff…” Doc. 259.  Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers showed this 
was false and that they did not give anything to Ms. Maxwell. Doc. 258.  
In addition, there was a videotape of the incident. But the government 
refused to review it and refused to provide it to the court. The defense 
insisted on having a hearing and that it be provided with the videotape 
of the attorney-client visit so that it could show that the MDC statements 
to the government were false. The court declined to have a hearing or 
order the videotape turned over. The truth is actually out there. We 
simply want an opportunity to demonstrate it at a hearing. 
Ironically, the court then blamed the defense for failing to provide 
proof of its claims. The defense has, over and over again, requested 
hearings and that the videotapes of what is occurring in jail be produced.  
But the district court said that the defense “describes generalized 
grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for 
relief.” Doc. 282. This is an odd reason to deny Ms. Maxwell relief, 
especially where even the government admits that guards flash a light in 
Ms. Maxwell’s cell every 15 minutes and that she is not provided an eye 
mask. We have said and continue to say that we would like production of 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page10 of 14

 
9 
 
the evidence and a hearing so that we may demonstrate our other claims.  
These requests have been denied.  In any event, the government does not 
even deny most of the allegations we have made – Ms. Maxwell is being 
kept up at night, that oftentimes the water is undrinkable, that the food 
is not delivered or inedible, that her computer cannot perform the 
necessary tasks to prepare for trial, and so on.   
Instead, the government simply says that the district judge is 
managing Ms. Maxwell’s conditions. Again, that is just not true. The 
district court has made it clear – again in its latest order – that it won’t 
tell BOP what to do, even though BOP has not justified in any way the 
treatment that Ms. Maxwell is receiving. As we have said from the start, 
everyone knows the real reason she is being subjected to these abusive 
tactics: because Jeffrey Epstein died on BOP’s watch and it is going to 
treat Ms. Maxwell as though she is Epstein.   
In sentencing another woman who was held at MDC, District Judge 
Colleen McMahon said the defendant “shouldn’t have to suffer for the 
incompetence of the United States Department of Justice and its 
subsidiary agency, the Bureau of Prisons.  I will do what I can to bring 
your situation to the people who, if they give a damn, might do

something.”  See transcript of sentencing hearing, United States v.

We are appealing to this Court to do something, as Judge McMahon 
pleaded. Ghislaine Maxwell has a Constitutional right to be able to 
prepare effectively for trial.  The conditions of her pretrial detention 
deprive her of that right.  For almost a year, she has been held in the 
equivalent of solitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental 
condition from lack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every 
15 minutes by lights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate water 
and food, the constant glare of neon light, and intrusive searches, 
including having hands forced into her mouth in a squalid facility where 
COVID has run rampant.  
Ms. Maxwell understands that she and the government are not 
going to agree on the facts. This is an adversary system, of course. But 
when the government’s representations about the conditions of 
confinement continue to be demonstrably and admittedly false, there 
needs to be an intervention. If the Court is not prepared to temporarily 
release Ms. Maxwell on bond so that she can prepare for trial, it should 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page12 of 14

 
11 
 
order the district court to conduct a hearing on the conditions of her 
confinement so that the defense can make the appropriate showing.

20-CR-330 (AJN) 
 
ORDER 
 
 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 
 
On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell wrote to the Court requesting that the 
Court address her sleeping conditions, with particular emphasis on counsel’s representation, 
unsupported by affidavit or other factual showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in 
Maxwell’s eyes every 15 minutes at night.  Dkt. No. 256.  Defense counsel claims that the 
flashlight surveillance in Maxwell’s eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her 
ability to prepare for and withstand trial.  The Court sought more information by ordering the 
Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain 
questions.  Dkt. No. 257.  In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight 
checks of all inmates as a matter of course.  Dkt. No. 270.  As reported by the Government, 
inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 
30 minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per 
night at regular intervals.  The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights 
are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in 
distress.  As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP’s 
flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including 
that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that

can arise in high-profile cases.  The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more 
frequent safety and security checks.  The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye 
masks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-
contraband items to cover her eyes. 
To the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override BOP’s 
determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that 
request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.  Certainly nothing in the 
record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for 
her trial and communicate with her lawyers.  Defense counsel’s May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 
272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application 
for relief.  Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-
trial detainees can be reduced.  The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to 
continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP 
determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, 
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.  
The Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel 
for the MDC. 
SO ORDERED.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                  S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
 
During oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms. 
Maxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while 
detained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court.  In its brief denial 
of her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping 
conditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A.  We press our 
concerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep 
deprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial. 
 
Ms. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a 
flash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked.  The myth that Ms. 
Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest 
during the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim.  In fact, Ms. Maxwell 
is classified with the standard CC1-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health 
care. (See Dkt. 159 at 3.) 
Contrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. 196 
at 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she 
resorts to using a sock or towel to cover her eyes in an awkward attempt to shield them from 
disrupting illumination every 15 minutes.  Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a 
visible bruise over her left eye.  The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B.  Despite 24/7 camera 
surveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as 
they did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who 
has no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point, 
MDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her 
in the SHU if she did not reveal how she got it.  While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of 
the bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has grown increasingly reluctant to report 
information to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. However, there 
is concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the 
lights projected into her cell throughout the night.

 The MDC routinely places inmates in the SHU if they have engaged in physical 
altercation with other inmates or to protect inmates who are the subject of abuse.  It would be 
ironic if the MDC follows through with its threat to place Ms. Maxwell in the SHU: It would 
signal that Ms. Maxwell needs protection from the very staff so intent on protecting her, since 
she has no contact with anyone but staff.  
As suggested by the Circuit, we ask the Court to address Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping 
conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or 
justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.  
Very truly yours,

Appellant expressed concern that Appellant was improperly being deprived of sleep while 
incarcerated.  To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping conditions, such request 
should be addressed to the District Court.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
 
 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated 
April 29, 2021, which directed the Government to confer with legal counsel at the Metropolitan 
Detention Center (“MDC”) regarding the use of flashlights in security checks at MDC.  (Dkt. No. 
257).  The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s 
Order, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.  
MDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a matter of course throughout the facility 
for the safety and security of the inmates at the institution.  During these flashlight checks, MDC 
staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that 
the inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress.  MDC staff conduct flashlight checks 
every 30 minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct 
flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular 
intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.   
With respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes 
because the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule.  That is

because MDC has identified a number of factors that raise heightened safety and security concerns 
with respect to this defendant, including: (1) the nature of the charges, (2) the potential stress for 
inmates that can arise in high-profile cases, and (3) the need to ensure the defendant’s safety while 
she is incarcerated in a cell by herself—a housing determination made by MDC staff based on 
various factors, including the defendant’s expressed concern for her safety if she were to be housed 
in the general population.1  
 
 
As to the Court’s question whether the defendant can be provided with “appropriate eye 
covering,” MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that the defendant cannot be provided 
with an eye mask.  Eye masks are not available for purchase in commissary and are not issued to 
inmates and, therefore, are considered contraband.  The defendant is permitted, however, to use 
non-contraband items to cover her eyes at night.   
Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic, 
the Government will promptly confer with legal counsel at MDC and provide additional 
information.

1 The MDC has determined the defendant’s current housing assignment based, in part, on her 
concerns about being housed in the general population and as an alternative to her being housed 
in the SHU.  By contrast, in the SHU, most inmates have a cellmate which provides an additional 
check should something go wrong or should an inmate need medical attention in the middle of the 
night.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
 
 
 
 
       S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
 
Once again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC, 
the reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable.  In its May 5th letter regarding the 
MDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 270), the government contradicts a 
previous report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her 
counsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s 
bail appeal. Now, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms. 
Maxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband.  This alone is a basis for the Court to 
question the veracity of representations made by the MDC. 
To justify the 15-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive 
sleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security 
schedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns” 
with respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious.  They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of 
other pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants 
charged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of 
release and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves.  The MDC 
attempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s 
“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”  
The MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake 
Screening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2020 posed the 
following question: “Do you know of any reason why you should not be placed in general 
population?”  Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the 
determination regarding general population or degree of segregation.  The Intake Screening

Form listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and 
concerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press 
by other inmates.  Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had 
been vaccinated. 
Further, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell 
completed two programs to assist other inmates- (1) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to 
help update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her  
de facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others. 
 
Ms. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the 
MDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked 
to her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed 
her at all in a 20-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal 
documents, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an 
effort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s 
and BP-10s only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response 
was told the form was either lost or never filed,   Each and every day of her detention, she is 
guarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera, 
her every move: when she eats, showers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards 
feverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears 
that they go beyond their routine continual 15-minute reporting.   
Further, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time.  It was the staff who 
confronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her 
learning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss 
personal matters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of 
someone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that 
information, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance.  We invite the 
Court and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms. 
Maxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with 
family and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her 
family in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United 
States.

In the face of the Epstein’s death on the BOP’s watch, the MDC would not risk a repeat 
of the debacle that occurred in the MCC.  There can be no doubt that the MDC was following 
directives from Attorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that 
Ms. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the 
MDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general 
population, knowing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and 
extortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards.  But 
that decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell’s 
detention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial. 
 
We have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell’s health and the impact her 
conditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for 
trial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial, 
which we moved to the fall. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly more obvious that 
Ms. Maxwell’s extreme conditions of detention will not be improved and health deteriorate 
commensurate with the unprecedented conditions of confinement unparalleled in the MDC.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
2. 
Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) was filed on June 29, 2020, 
charging Maxwell in six counts. On July 2, 2020, Maxwell was arrested. On July 8, 
2020, Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Indictment”) was filed containing the 
same charges with ministerial corrections. (Dkt. 17 (“Ind.”)).1  Count One charges 
Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Two charges Maxwell with enticing a minor 
to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.  
Count Three charges Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors to participate in 
illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Four charges Maxwell with 
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2423 and 2.  Counts Five and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of 
18 U.S.C. § 1623.  
3. 
On July 14, 2020, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States 
District Judge, held a lengthy bail hearing, at the conclusion of which she denied

Maxwell bail. (Ex. D). Maxwell twice renewed her bail application (Ex. E, I), which 
motions Judge Nathan denied in written orders dated December 28, 2020 and March 
22, 2021 (Ex. H, L).  Maxwell filed notices of appeal from these two orders (though 
not the original detention order). 
4. 
On April 27, 2021, this Court affirmed the orders denying 
Maxwell’s pretrial release that were entered by Judge Nathan on December 28, 2020 
and March 22, 2021, and denied Maxwell’s motion for bail, or in the alternative, 
temporary pretrial release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). 
5. 
On May 17, 2021, Maxwell filed a renewed motion for pretrial 
release, seeking to relitigate this Court’s ruling. 
6. 
Maxwell’s trial is now scheduled to begin on November 29, 
2021. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
7. 
This Court is already familiar with the factual and procedural 
background of this case, which were detailed in the Government’s Affirmation in 
Opposition to Defendant’s Appeal of Orders Denying Pretrial Release, dated April 
12, 2021.  The Government respectfully incorporates by reference the facts and 
arguments set forth in its April 12, 2021 opposition. 
8. 
In sum, the Indictment charges Maxwell with facilitating the 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page3 of 24

4 
 
sexual abuse of multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 
1994 and 1997.2  (Ind. ¶ 1).  During that period, Maxwell played a key role in 
Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor 
victims, who were as young as 14 years old, to engage in sex acts with Epstein.  
(Id.).  Together, Maxwell and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims 
to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.  (Ind. ¶ 
2).  To conceal her crimes, Maxwell lied under oath during a civil deposition, 
including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.  (Id.). 
9. 
The Indictment contains detailed speaking allegations which 
describe: the means and methods of Maxwell’s criminal conduct (Ind. ¶ 4); 
Maxwell’s interactions with three minor victims (Ind. ¶¶ 7(a)-(c)); specific overt acts 
performed by Maxwell (Ind. ¶¶ 11(a)-(d)); and specific false statements that form 
the basis of the perjury charges (Ind. ¶¶ 21, 23). 
 
2 After Judge Nathan’s bail decisions were issued, Superseding Indictment S2 20 
Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Superseding Indictment”) was filed, charging Maxwell in eight 
counts.  In addition to the original six charges, the Superseding Indictment also 
charges Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, 
and sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.  Among other 
things, the Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged 
in Counts One and Three from 1994 through 2004 and identified a fourth victim of 
those conspiracies. 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page4 of 24

5 
 
10. 
As the Government has explained in oral and written proffers, 
the allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of 
three different victim-witnesses.  (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-10).  Each 
victim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-
witnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence, 
including flight records, diary entries, and other evidence.  (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F 
at 10-12). 
11. 
Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District 
Court, each of which was thoroughly briefed.  Judge Nathan denied all three 
applications in careful and thorough decisions.   
12. 
First, after receiving extensive written submissions from the 
parties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July 14, 2020, at which 
she heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims.  Judge 
Nathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and 
explained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling.  (Ex. D at 79-91).  In reaching 
this decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense 
here weigh in favor of detention” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this 
early juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and 
characteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83).  Among other 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page5 of 24

6 
 
things, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,” 
including “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections 
abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.”  (Id.).  Judge 
Nathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,” 
lacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,” 
and made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not 
provide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.”  (Id. at 83-84).  
Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of 
demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even 
the most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s 
appearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her 
financial] resources and herself.”  (Id. at 86-87).  Judge Nathan also rejected 
Maxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated, 
finding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her 
counsel.  Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to 
provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the 
defense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the 
process was “inadequate in any way.”  (Id. at 90-91).  
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page6 of 24

7 
 
13. 
Second, on December 8, 2020, Maxwell renewed her request for 
bail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions.  (Ex. 
E).  After considering multiple written submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan 
denied Maxwell’s application in a detailed written opinion (Ex. H).  Judge Nathan 
found that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or 
could have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s 
view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of 
conditions can ensure her appearance.”  (Ex. H at 1-2).  Among other things, 
Judge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of 
the Government’s proffer of evidence.  (Id. at 10).  Judge Nathan further found 
that Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign 
citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary 
financial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and 
to do so undetected.”  (Id. at 11-13).  Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s 
“pattern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial 
Services bears significantly” on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and 
characteristics.  (Id. at 15).  Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell 
presented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot 
reasonably assure her appearance.”  (Id. at 16).  Additionally, Judge Nathan was 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page7 of 24

8 
 
“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are 
uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus 
justify release.”  (Id. at 20).  In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully 
dispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan 
Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to 
communicate with her lawyers.  (Id.). 
14. 
Third, on February 23, 2021, Maxwell filed yet another bail 
application, proposing two additional bail conditions.  (Ex. I).  After considering 
multiple written submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request 
in another written opinion (Ex. L).  Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was 
warranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, 
Maxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, 
substantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s 
“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.  (Id. at 7).   Judge 
Nathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.  
Yet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable 
assurances.”  (Id. at 11). 
15. 
Throughout the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page8 of 24

9 
 
monitored Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the 
Government to submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A 
(compiling update letters and relevant court orders)), and by reviewing and 
addressing defense motions regarding Maxwell’s conditions of confinement (see, 
e.g., id. at 10-11). 
16. 
Maxwell appealed Judge Nathan’s latter two bail decisions.  In 
connection with that appeal, Maxwell also moved for pretrial release pending appeal.  
After receiving briefing and hearing oral argument, this Court affirmed Judge 
Nathan’s bail decisions and denied Maxwell’s motion for pretrial release on April 
27, 2021.  (Mot. Ex. A).  Responding to claims about Maxwell’s sleeping 
conditions that had been raised in her briefing and at oral argument, this Court’s 
order noted that any request for “relief specific to [Maxwell’s] sleeping conditions” 
at the MDC “should be addressed to the District Court.”  (Id.). 
17. 
At no point after this Court’s bail decision did Maxwell file a 
renewed motion for pretrial release in the District Court. 
18. 
Following the issuance of this Court’s decision, on April 29, 
2021, Maxwell submitted a letter to Judge Nathan asking the District Court “to 
address Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-
minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or justify the need for the disruptive 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page9 of 24

10 
 
flashlight surveillance.”  (Mot. Ex. C at 2).  That same day, Judge Nathan directed 
the Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court 
with an explanation of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell 
at night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye 
covering for Maxwell’s use at night.  (Dkt. 257). 
19. 
On May 5, 2021, the Government submitted a letter to Judge 
Nathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.  
(Mot. Ex. D).  First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are 
subject to some form of flashlight checks throughout the night for their safety and 
security.  In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in 
order to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell, 
breathing, and not in distress.”  (Id. at 1).  MDC staff conduct such checks every 
30 minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour 
for inmates housed in general population.  (Id.).  Because Maxwell is on an 
enhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nighttime checks on her every 
15 minutes.  (Id.).  Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has 
determined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of 
nighttime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise 
heightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page10 of 24

11 
 
increased stress of a high-profile case, and her sleeping situation in a cell by herself 
without a cellmate.  (Id. at 2).  Third, the Government noted that the MDC would 
not permit Maxwell to have an eye mask because such an item is not available in 
commissary and is not issued to inmates.  (Id.).  MDC staff do, however, permit 
Maxwell to cover her eyes at night using other items that are available in commissary 
or that are issued to inmates.  (Id.). 
20. 
In response, on May 7, 2021, Maxwell filed a reply letter 
disputing the MDC’s explanation for the implementation of an enhanced security 
schedule for Maxwell and raising additional concerns regarding conditions at the 
MDC beyond Maxwell’s sleeping conditions but without seeking particular relief as 
to those conditions.  (Mot. Ex. E).  At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in 
support of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.  
21. 
On May 14, 2021, Judge Nathan issued a written decision 
denying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nighttime 
monitoring schedule.  (Mot. Ex. B).  In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan 
noted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her 
eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual 
showing.”  (Id. at 1).  Judge Nathan emphasized that all MDC inmates are subject 
to nighttime flashlight checks and found that “there are a number of neutral reasons” 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page11 of 24

12 
 
justifying the MDC’s decision to monitor Maxwell more frequently at night than 
other inmates.  (Id.).  With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the 
prohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is 
nevertheless permitted to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at 
night.  (Id. at 2).  Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly 
establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her 
trial and communicate with her lawyers.”  (Id.).  Consistent with the attention she 
has paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement throughout the pendency of this 
case, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “to continue to ensure 
that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for 
her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent 
with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.”  (Id.). 
ARGUMENT 
Maxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied 
 
22. 
This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s orders denying 
bail or temporary pretrial release to Maxwell and accordingly denied her motions 
seeking such relief on appeal.  The instant motion, which Maxwell styles as a 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page12 of 24

13 
 
“renewed motion for pretrial relief,” is both procedurally improper and substantively 
meritless.  It should be denied.   
A. 
Applicable Law 
23. 
When seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the 
burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a 
risk of flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably 
assure her presence in court.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 
493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007).  
24. 
Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including 
offenses involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory 
presumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably 
assure the appearance of the person as required . . . .”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E).  
In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden 
of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he 
does not pose . . . a risk of flight.”  United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 
(2d Cir. 2001). 
25. 
Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the 
court must consider: (1) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2) 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page13 of 24

14 
 
“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and 
characteristics of the person.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).  
26. 
This Court applies “deferential review to a district court’s order 
of detention.”  United States v. Watkins, 940 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 2019).  It 
reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight and 
whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s 
appearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011); 
United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 196 (2d Cir. 1987), and will reverse only if 
“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a 
mistake has been committed,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75. 
27. 
Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer 
may “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States 
marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer 
determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or 
for another compelling reason.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(i).  The defendant bears the 
burden of showing that temporary release is necessary.  See United States v. 
Scarborough, 821 F. App’x 598, 600 (6th Cir. 2020); United States v. Belardo, No. 
20 Cr. 126 (LTS), 2020 WL 1689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020).  This Court 
has not resolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page14 of 24

15 
 
abuse of discretion or clear error.  See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 
853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2021). 
B. 
Discussion 
28. 
This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail 
determinations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release.  The only 
changed circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s 
determination that the MDC’s nighttime security protocols do not interfere with 
Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that 
Judge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s 
prior bail applications. 
29. 
As an initial matter, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket 
a new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan.  Instead, she filed her 
“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively 
asking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision.  To the extent 
this motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 40(a)(1) and Local Rules 40.1 and 40.2. 
30. 
In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal, 
Maxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District 
Court based on any alleged changed circumstances.  As this Court has explained in 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page15 of 24

16 
 
the context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be 
made in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be 
made initially in the district court.”  United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d 342, 344 
(2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from 
detention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 6 (1951) (explaining, 
before passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper procedure for challenging 
bail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of 
Appeals from an order denying such motion”).  The Order Maxwell annexes to her 
motion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—is not a bail 
determination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order.  See Fed. R. 
App. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of 
the district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal”).  
No bail determination is properly before this Court. 
31. 
In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively 
meritless.  This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error 
in finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the 
evidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably 
assure her appearance in court.  This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan 
did not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page16 of 24

17 
 
of confinement do not warrant temporary release.  Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed 
motion alters that conclusion. 
32. 
“As a general matter, this Court will adhere to its own decision 
at an earlier stage of the litigation.”  United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d 118, 123 (2d 
Cir. 2011).  The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for 
compelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling 
law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent 
manifest injustice.”  Id. at 123–24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 213 F.3d 34, 
39 (2d Cir. 2000) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy 
absent cogent or compelling reasons.”).  Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason, 
let alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at 123, for this Court to reverse its 
prior decision. 
33. 
The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her 
request that this Court reverse itself is additional letter briefing before the District 
Court regarding MDC’s nighttime security checks.  Nothing about that briefing or 
Judge Nathan’s most recent written order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred 
when finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her discretion when determining 
that temporary release is not warranted. 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page17 of 24

18 
 
34. 
Consistent with her practice throughout the pendency of this 
case, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that 
nighttime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.  
When Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nighttime 
surveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a 
response from the MDC and evaluated the explanation provided.  In so doing, 
Judge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol 
based on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice. 
35. 
Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of 
Prisons what to do.”  (Mot. at 2).  But even assuming that it were proper for a 
District Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a 
jail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase 
of nighttime checks from the 30-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the 15-
minute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that 
heighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell.  Unlike most other inmates, 
Maxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and 
Maxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress 
of which increases the possibility that she may self-harm.  Moreover, as Judge 
Nathan noted, Maxwell offered no evidence to support the notion that those 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page18 of 24

19 
 
nighttime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to 
the ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her 
from being able to prepare her defense.3 
36. 
It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a 
motion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant 
only insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial.  As this Court previously 
recognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability 
to prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court.  Maxwell availed 
herself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security 
protocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial.  Tellingly, 
 
3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during 
the course of this case.  It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that 
Maxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband 
items to cover her eyes.  The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language 
in an April 6, 2021 letter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and 
acknowledged the inaccuracy.  The remaining accusations, however, are 
unfounded.  For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral 
argument about nighttime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that 
it involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every 
15 minutes.  To the contrary, when asked whether the nighttime checks were 
conducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t 
speak to what is done as to all inmates.”  Only after conferring with the MDC did 
the Government convey to Judge Nathan, and now this Court, the MDC’s procedures 
for nighttime checks of all inmates.  The Government has and will continue to 
accurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to 
respond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court. 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page19 of 24

20 
 
Maxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application 
for pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its 
operations or justify its procedures.  In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s 
protocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well 
within her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.  
Even in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s 
conditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation 
for trial.  This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused 
her substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or 
temporary release. 
37. 
To the extent Maxwell now raises new complaints about 
conditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the 
District Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan.  In any event, as was the case with 
her concerns about nighttime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to 
support her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from 
preparing for trial.  There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare 
assertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides 
inadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflows 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page20 of 24

21 
 
into Maxwell’s unit. 4  Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as 
corroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding 
described in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the 
“MCC”), not the MDC.  (See United States v. Days, 19 Cr. 619 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 29, 2021), Sentencing Tr. at 13-16 (describing incidents Tiffany Days 
experienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being 
transferred to the MDC)).  There is no evidence in the record from the Days case 
or this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC 
during Maxwell’s incarceration there.  To the extent Maxwell suggests that any 
such issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should 
seek relief before the District Court.  Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about 
her ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge 
Nathan.5 
 
4 Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at 
3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general 
population.  Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general 
population.  Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that 
she is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody.  Rather, Maxwell has 
access to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during 
which she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a 
telephone, a television, and a shower.  (See Dkt. 196 at 2). 
 
5 As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC 
have gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page21 of 24

22 
 
38. 
The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture 
is whether Judge Nathan committed clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight 
risk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell temporary release.  Nothing 
in the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a 
real risk of flight.  Nor does the renewed motion explain how Judge Nathan’s 
careful consideration of the MDC’s nighttime security protocols and continued 
monitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with 
counsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion.  Simply 
put, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to 
reverse its prior decision in this case.  Plugh, 648 F.3d at 123. 
 
 
 
to review her discovery.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. 196 at 1-2).  Among 
other things, Maxwell has exclusive access to both a desktop and a laptop computer 
on which to review her discovery, thirteen hours per day, seven days per week.  She 
is also able to review discovery with her attorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-
teleconference calls she receives each week.  (See Dkt. 196 at 1-2).
