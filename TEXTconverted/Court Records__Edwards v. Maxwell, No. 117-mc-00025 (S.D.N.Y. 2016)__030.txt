ENDORSED ORDER granting in part and denying in part 6 Defendant's Motion to Seal. Exhibits A,
G, H, I, and N, (which were attached to Defendant's response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion to
quash), will be sealed for one year from the filing date. The Undersigned grants Defendant leave to

Ï 19 
ENDORSED ORDER denying without prejudice 12 Plaintiff's motion for leave to file excess pages
for failure to comply with Local Rule 7.1.
The motion for leave to file an "over length reply" 12 represents that "plaintiff will supplement this
motion once such position [i.e., opposing counsel's position] has been obtained." No supplement has
been filed since the motion was filed. Therefore, Plaintiff shall by December 16, 2016 file a notice
advising the Undersigned of Defendant's position. If Defendant opposes the request for additional
pages for Plaintiff's reply, then Defendant shall by December 19, 2016 file a memorandum not to
exceed three pages (excluding signature block and certificate of service), explaining the reasons.
In addition, given the time which has passed since the motion to quash was initially filed, Plaintiff's
notice shall also explain the status of the underlying case in the Southern District of New York and
whether the subpoena issue is still active and in need of a ruling by the Undersigned. Assuming that
the issue is still an issue, then the Undersigned will rule on the motion for additional pages for the
reply.
