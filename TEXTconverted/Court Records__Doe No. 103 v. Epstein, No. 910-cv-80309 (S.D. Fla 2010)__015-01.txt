UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 10-80309-CIV-
JANE DOE No. 103, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFERY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S AMENDED MOTION TO DISMISS,COUNT 
VI & FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT & TO STRIKE DIRECTED 
TO PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 103'S COMPLAINT [dated 2/23/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, files this Amended Motion To Dismiss Count VI, & Motion For More Definite 
Statement & Strike Directed To Plaintiff JANE DOE I 03 's Complaint. Defendant moves 
to dismiss Count Six of Plaintiff JANE DOE 103's Complaint for failure to state a cause 
of action, as specified herein. Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. (2009); Local Gen. Rule 7.1 
(S.D. Fla. 2009). Defendant further moves for More Definite Statement and to Strike. 
Rule 12(e) and (f), In support of his motion, Defendant states: 
The Complaint attempts to allege 6 counts, all of which are purportedly brought 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 - Civil Remedies/or Personal Injuries. Count Six is subject 
to dismissal because the predicate act relied upon by Plaintiff for her claims did not come 
into effect until July 27, 2006, well after the conduct alleged by Plaintiff occurred. The 
More Definite Statement requested is for Plaintiff to allege her date of birth in that her 
being a minor has significance in the claims she alleges.

Supporting Memorandum of Law 
Principles of Statutory Interpretation 
It is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's inquiry begins with the 
plain and unan1biguous language of the statutory text. CBS, Inc. v. Prime Time 24 
Venture, 245 F.3d 1217 (11 th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Castroneves, 2009 WL 528251, *3 (S.D. 
Fla. 2009), citing Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F.3d 732, 734 (11 th Cir. 2008); and Smith v. 
Husband, 376 F.Supp.2d at 610 ("When interpreting a statute, [a court's] inquiry begins 
with the text."). "The Court must first look to the plain meaning of the words, and 
scrutinize the statute's 'language, structure, and purpose."' Id. In addition, in construing 
a statute, a court is to presume that the legislature said what it means and means what it 
said, and not add language or give some absurd or strained interpretation. As stated in 
CBS, Inc., supra at 1228 - "Those who ask courts to give effect to perceived legislative 
intent by interpreting statutory language contrary to its plain and unambiguous meaning 
are in effect asking courts to alter that language, and ' [ c ]ourts have no authority to alter 
statutory language .... We cannot add to the terms of [the] provision what Congress left 
out.' Merritt, 120 F.3d at 1187." See also Dodd v. U.S., 125 S.Ct. 2478 (2005); 73 
Am.Jur.2d Statutes § 124. 
Title 18 of the U.S.C. is entitled "Crimes and Criminal Procedure." §2255 is 
contained in "Part I. Crimes, Chap. 110. Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of 
Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2002)1, is entitled Civil remedy for personal injuries, and 
provides: 
1 The above quoted version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 was the same beginning in 1999 until 
amended in 2006, effective July 27, 2006.

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 3 of 16
(a) Any minor who is a victim of a violation of section 224l(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers 
personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate United 
States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains 
and the cost of the snit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as 
described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages 
of no less than $50,000 in value. 
( b) Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the complaint 
is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues or in the case of a 
person under a legal disability, not later than three years after the disability. 
See endnote 1 hereto for statutory text as amended in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. Prior to the 2006 amendments, the version of the statute quoted above was in 
effect beginning in 1999. 1 
All of Plaintiffs allegations of abuse occurred between January 2004 and May 
2005 (par. 18), well prior to 18 U.S.C. §2255 being amended. 
Motion to Dismiss 
PlaintifPs reliance on the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, such reliance is 
improper. The version of Defendant's position that 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect 
prior to the 2006 amendments applies to this action, and therefore Count Six is 
required to be dismissed as it relies on a predicate act that was not in effect at 
the time of the alleged conduct.
23 
Plaintiff does not specifically allege in her Complaint on which version of 18 
U.S.C. §2255 she is relying. However, in Count Six of her Complaint, i!50, she alleges 
that Defendant "knowingly engaged in a child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 
U.S.C. §2252A(g)(2), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g)(l)." §2252A is one of the 
2 Points (2) and (3) are addressed together as the legal arguments overlap. 
3 In other §2255 actions filed against Defendant, Defendant has previously asserted the position 
that 18 U.S.C. §2255's creates a single cause of action on behalf of a plaintiff against a 
defendant, as opposed to multiple causes of action on a per violation basis or as opposed to an 
allowance of a multiplication of the statutory presumptive minimum damages or "actual 
damages." EPSTEIN asserts his position regarding the single recovery of damages in order to 
properly preserve all issues pertaining to the proper application of §2255 for appeal. EPSTEIN 
will fully honor his obligations as set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United 
States Attorney's Office; principally, as related to the claims made in this case by Jane Doe 103, 
the obligations as set forth in paragraph 8 of that Agreement. In particular, EPSTEIN will not 
contest the allegation that he committed at least one predicate offense as alleged by Jane Doe 
103.

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 4 of 16
specified predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. §2255. However, subsection (g) of §2252 was 
not added to the statute until 2006. Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff is relying on the 
amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, such reliance is improper and Count Six is required 
to be dismissed as it relies on a statutory predicate act that did not exist at the time of the 
alleged conduct. 
According to Plaintiffs allegations, the alleged conduct of EPSTEIN directed to 
Plaintiff occurred beginning in January 2004 until approximately May 2005. In Count 
VI, in attempting to assert a claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff is relying on 
subsection, (g)(l) and (2), of the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. §2252A as the requisite 
predicate act. Subsection (g) of §2252A was not even in existence at the time of the 
alleged conduct. Subsection (g) was enacted in 2006, effective July 27, 2006. See 2006 
Amendments; Pub.L. 109-248, § 701, added subsec. (g). 18 U.S.C.A. § 2252A. As 
discussed more fully below herein, reliance on subsection (g) violates the well entrenched 
constitutional principles against retroactivity, and, thus, Count VI is required to be 
dismissed. 
The statute in effect during the time the alleged conduct occurred is 18 U.S.C. 
§2255 (2005) - the version in effect prior to the 2006 amendment, eff. Jul. 27, 2006, 
( quoted above), and having an effective date of 1999 through July 26, 2006. 
See 
endnote 1 hereto. Plaintiffs Complaint alleges that Defendant's conduct occurred during 
the time period from the age of 17, January 2004 until approximately May 2005. 
Complaint, 'i['i[l 7, 18. Thus, the version in effect in 2004-2005 of 18 U.S.C. §2255 
applies.

It is an axiom of law that "retroactivity is not favored in the law." Bowen, 488 
U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471 (1988). As eloquently stated in Landgraf v. US! Film 
Products, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1497, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994): 
. . . the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. 
Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an 
opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled 
expectations should not be lightly disrupted_FNI& For that reason, the "principle that the 
legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the 
conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 
S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both 
commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people 
confidence about the legal consequences of their actions. 
FN18. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 
1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents problems of 
unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because 
it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions"); 
[Further citations omitted]. 
It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds expression in 
several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits 
retroactive application of penal legislation.FN19 Article I, § 10, cl. I, prohibits States 
from passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws "impairing the Obligation of 
Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legislature (and other 
government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for 
a "public use" and upon payment of 'just compensation." The prohibitions on "Bills of 
Attainder" in Art. I, § § 9-I 0, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons 
and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. 
Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). The 
Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be 
compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's 
prospective application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retroactive 
application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. I, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 
49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). 
FN19. Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress(§ 9, 
cl. 3), the other to the States (§ JO, cl. I). We have construed the Clauses as 
applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-391, I 
L.Ed. 648 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). 
These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. The 
Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly 
and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a 
risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution 
against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for 
**1498 the Court in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, IOI S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 
5 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 6 of 16
(1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only ensures that individuals have "fair warning" 
about the effect of criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by 
restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation." Id, at 28-29, IO 1 S.Ct., at 
963-964 ( citations omitted). FN2o 
FN20. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 513-514, 109 S.Ct. 706, 
732, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that 
promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional prohibitions against 
the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern 
about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of 
private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather than the legislative process, that is 
best equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create 
the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed") 
(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); James v. United 
States, 366 U.S. 213, 247, n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) 
(retroactive punitive measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous 
conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or 
classes of persons"). 
These well entrenched constitutional protections and presumptions against 
retroactive application of legislation establish that 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) in effect at the 
time of the alleged conduct applies to the instant action, and not the amended version. 
Not only is there no clear express intent stating that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, but applying the current version of the statute, as amended in 2006, would 
be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution as it 
would be applied to events occurring before its enactment and would increase the penalty 
or punishment for the alleged crime. U.S. Const. Art. 1, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1. U.S. v. 
Seigel, 153 F.3d 1256 (11 th Cir. 1998); U.S. v. Edwards, 162 F.3d 87 (3d Cir. 1998); and 
generally, Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648, 1798 WL 587 (Calder) (1798). 
The United States Constitution provides that "[n]o Bill of Attainder or ex 
post facto Law shall be passed" by Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3. A law 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it" 'appli[es] to events occurring before its 
enactment ... [ and] disadvantage[ s] the offender affected by it' by altering the 
definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for the crime." 
Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997) (quoting 
Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)).

The statute, as amended in 2006, contains no language stating that the application 
is to be retroactive. 
Thus, there is no manifest intent that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, and, accordingly, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct 
is to apply. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 1493, ("A statement that a statute 
will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any 
application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."). 
This statute was enacted as part of the Federal Criminal Statutes targeting sexual 
predators and sex crimes against children. H.R. 3494, "Child Protection and Sexual 
Predator Pnnishment Act of 1998;" House Report No. 105-557, 11, 1998 U.S.C.A.N. 
678, 679 (1998). Quoting from the "Background and Need For Legislation" portion of 
the House Report No. 105-557, 11-16, H.R. 3494, of which 18 U.S.C. §2255 is included, 
is described as "the most comprehensive package of new crimes and increased penalties 
ever developed in response to crimes against children, particularly assaults facilitated by 
computers." 
Further showing that §2255 was enacted as a criminal penalty or 
punishment, "Title II - Punishing Sexual Predators," Sec. 206, from House Report No. 
105-557, 5-6, specifically includes reference to the remedy created under §2255 as an 
additional means of punishing sexual predators, along with other penalties and 
punishments. Senatorial Comments in amending §2255 in 2006 confirm that the creation 
of the presumptive minimum damage amount is meant as an additional penalty against 
those who sexually exploit or abuse children. 2006 WL 2034118, 152 Cong. Rec. S8012-
02. Senator Kerry refers to the statutorily imposed damage amount as "penalties." Id. 
The cases of U.S. v. Siegel, supra (1 Ith Cir. 1998), and U.S. v. Edwards, supra (3d 
Cir. 1998), also support Defendant's position that application of the current version of 18 
7 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 8 of 16
U.S.C. §2255 would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Siegel, the 
Eleventh Circuit found that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred application of the Mandatory 
Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MYRA) to the defendant whose criminal conduct 
occurred before the effective date of the statute, 18 U.S.C. §3664(f)(l)(A), even though 
the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding occurred after the effective date of the statute. 
On July 19, 1996, the defendant Siegel pleaded guilty to various charges under 18 U.S.C. 
§371 and §1956(a)(l)(A), (conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, and 
laundering of money instruments; and money laundering). He was sentenced on March 
7, 1997. As part of his sentence, Siegel was ordered to pay $1,207,000.00 in restitution 
under the MYRA which became effective on April 24, 1996. Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 
Stat. 1214, 1229-1236. The 1996 amendments to MYRA required that the district court 
must order restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss without consideration of the 
defendant's ability to pay. Prior to the enactment of the MYRA and under the former 18 
U.S.C. §3664(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), Pub.I. No. 
97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, the court was required to consider, among other factors, the 
defendant's ability to pay in determining the amount ofrestitution. 
When the MYRA was enacted in 1996, Congress stated that the amendments to the 
VWP A "shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing 
proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment 
of this Act [Apr. 24, 1996]." Siegel, supra at 1258. The alleged crimes occurred between 
February, 1988 to May, 1990. The Court agreed with the defendant's position that 1996 
MYRA "should not be applied in reviewing the validity of the court's restitution order 
8 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 9 of 16
because to do so would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States 
Constitution. See U.S. Const. art I, §9, cl. 3." 
The Ex Post Facto aualysis made by the Eleventh Circuit in Siegel is applicable to 
this action. In resolving the issue in favor of the defendaut, the Court first considered 
whether a restitution order is a punishment. Id, at 1259. In determining that restitution 
was a punishment, the Court noted that §3663A(a)(l) of Title 18 expressly describes 
restitution as a "penalty." In addition, the Court also noted that "[a]lthough not in the 
context of an ex post facto determination, ... restitution is a 'criminal penalty meant to 
have strong deterrent and rehabilitative effect.' United States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 
1493 n. 12 (11th Cir.1997)." Second, the Court considered "whether the imposition of 
restitution under the MYRA is au increased penalty as prohibited by the Ex Post Facto 
Clause." Id, at 1259. In determining that the application of the 1996 MYRA would 
indeed run afoul of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court agreed with the 
majority of the Circuits that restitution under the 1996 MYRA was au increased penalty.4 
"The effect of the MYRA can be detrimental to a defendant. Previously, after considering 
the defendant's financial condition, the court had the discretion to order restitution in au 
amount less thau the loss sustained by the victim. Under the MYRA, however, the court 
must order restitution to each victim in the full amount." Id, at 1260. See also U.S. v. 
Edwards, 162 F.2d 87 (3rd Circuit 1998). 
4 The Eleventh Circuit, in holding that "the MYRA caunot be applied to a person whose 
criminal conduct occurred prior to April 24, 1996," was "persuaded by the majority of 
districts on this issue." "Restitution is a criminal penalty carrying with it characteristics 
of criminal punishment." Siegel, supra at 1260. The Eleventh Circuit is in agreement 
with the Second, Third, Eighth, Ninth, aud D.C. Circuits. See U.S. v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 
1286, 1289-90 (11 th Cir. 2000).

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 10 of 16
As discussed above, 18 U.S.C. §2255 was enacted as part of the criminal statutory 
scheme to punish and penalize those who sexually exploit and abuse minors, and thus, the 
Ex Post Fact Clause prohibits a retroactive application of the 2006 amended version. 
Notwithstanding the above legal analysis, in the recent case of Individual Known 
to Defendant As 08MIST096.JPG and 08mist067.jpg v. Falso, 2009 WL 4807537 (N.D. 
N.Y. Dec. 9, 2009), United States District Court for the Northern District of New York 
addressed the issue of whether §2255 is a civil or criminal statute for purposes of the 
constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. 
The New York Court stated that 
"looking to the plain language of §2255(a), it is clear that the statutory intent was to 
provide a civil remedy. This is exemplified by the title ... and the fact that the statute 
aims to provide compensation to individuals who suffered personal injury as a result of 
criminal conduct against them." The New York Court in analyzing whether §2255 
violated the Constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, concluded that although 
the behavior to which §2255 is criminal, it did not find that the "primary aim" was 
"retribution and deterrence." "The statute serves civil goals." The "primary aim" is "the 
compensation for personal injuries sustained as a result of criminal conduct." 
Therefore, because Jane Doe 103 has invoked the provisions of the criminal Non-
Prosecution Agreement (NP A) between EPSTEIN and USAO (see paragraphs 25 and 26 
of complaint), plaintiff cannot avoid the full protection of the rule of lenity and due 
process to which EPSTEIN is entitled in the context of these unique factual 
circumstances. 
Although there does not exist a11y definitive ruling of whether the damages 
awarded under §2255 are meant as criminal punishment or a civil damages award, 
10 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 11 of 16
Defendant is still entitled to a determination as a matter of law that the statute in effect at 
the time of the alleged criminal conduct applies. 
As explained by the Landgraf court, supra at 280, and at 1505, 5 
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's 
first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper 
reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default 
rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must 
determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would 
impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past 
conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the 
statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not 
govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result. 
Here, there is no clear expression of intent regarding the 2006 Act's application to 
conduct occurring well before its enactment. 
See discussion of House Bill Reports and 
Congressional background above herein. 
As stated in Landgraf, "the extent of a party's liability, in the civil context as well as 
the criminal, is an important legal consequence that cannot be ignored." Courts have 
consistently refused to apply a statute which substantially increases a party's liability to 
conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. Landgraf, supra at 284-85. Even if 
plaintiff were to argue that retroactive application of the new statute "would vindicate its 
purpose more fully," even that consideration is not enough to rebut the presumption 
against retroactivity. Id, at 285-86. "The presumption against statutory retroactivity is 
founded upon sound considerations of general policy and practice, and accords with long 
held and widely shared expectations about the usual operation of legislation." Id. 
Thus, Count Six should be dismissed. 
5 In Landgraf, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals 
and refused to apply new provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to conduct occurring before 
the effective date of the Act. The Court determined that statutory text in question, § l 02, was

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 12 of 16
Motion For More Definite Statement and To Strike, Rule 12(e) and {fl, F.R.C.P. 
As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that she was 17 year old high school student as 
of January, 2004, and that the alleged conduct involving EPSTEIN occurred "between 
approximately January 2004 and May 2005. Thus, Plaintiff had to be 18 (no longer a 
minor) by January of 2005. Under the principles of statutory construction, the language 
of §2255(a) is clear - "Any minor who is a victim of a violation of section ... of this title 
and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate 
United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains 
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as described in 
the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than 
$50,000 in valne." 
As Plaintiffs date of birth is significant to her §2255 claim, she should be 
required to more definitely state her date of birth so that Defendant and this Court are 
able to determine precisely when she reached the age of majority. (The age of majority 
under both federal and state law is 18 years old. See 18 U.S.C. §2256(1), defining a 
"minor" as "any person under the age of eighteen years;" and §1.01, Definitions, Fla. 
Stat., defining "minor" to include "any person who has not attained the age of 18 years.") 
To the extent that Plaintiff is relying on any alleged conduct that occurred after 
her 18 birthday as an element of her §2255 claim, such allegations should be stricken as 
immaterial and she should be required to more definitely state the dates of the alleged 
conduct. See Rule 12(f). Defendant also seeks to strike ,,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 
of Plaintiffs Complaint as immaterial and impertinent. None of the allegations in those 
paragraphs specifically pertain to the Plaintiff. 
Not until ,17 does Plaintiff assert 
12 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 13 of 16
allegations pertaining to her and the conduct of Defendant directly involving her. What 
EPSTErN may or may not have allegedly done with respect to other alleged girls does 
not effect Plaintiffs claim brought pursuant to §2255. The allegations in ,r,rl0-16 are not 
related to the elements of Plaintiffs §2255 claim and, thus, are required to be stricken. 
Conclusion 
Pursuant to the above, Count Six is required to be dismissed. In addition, Plaintiff 
should be required to more definitely state her date of birth, and any conduct occurring 
after her 18th birthday should be stricken, and ,r,r10 - 16 of the Complaint should also be 
stricken. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Count Six against him, 
and further grant his Motion for More Definite Statement and to Strike.
