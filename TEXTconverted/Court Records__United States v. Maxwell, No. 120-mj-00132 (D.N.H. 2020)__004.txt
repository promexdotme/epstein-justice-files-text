GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
COUNT ONE 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
20 Cr. 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal ~ex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple -minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. 
In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, ~AXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. 
The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 

Case 1:20-mj-00132-AJ   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 3 of 19
Case 1:20-mj-00132-AJ     Document 4     Filed 07/06/20     Page 5 of 33
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. 
Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. 
In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. 
Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image:

4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. 
MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. 
Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epsiein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. 
For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would

I 
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. 
In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. 
Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. 
As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. 
In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. 
Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. 
Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals,

directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims.

d. 
MAXWELL'S personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. 
In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. 
MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. 
During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. 
First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. 
MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein . 
Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. 
MAXWELL was present for

Case 1:20-mj-00132-AJ     Document 4     Filed 07/06/20     Page 11 of 33
and involved in some of this abuse. 
In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. 
Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. 
As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. 
Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. 
Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of SBxual abuse. 
MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. 
While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. 
MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. 
In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing

. an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. 
MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. 
Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. 
MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. 
During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. 
Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT

 Case No. 20-mj-132-AJ-1 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell 
 
Public Access Findings 
I. 
Background 
This hearing is taking place during the public health 
emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.  All parties to this 
proceeding, including the court, are appearing remotely via 
video.  In light of the anticipated volume of public and media 
interest and the operational/capacity limitations of 
videoconference technology, public and media access to the 
proceeding will be via telephonic conference.  The court’s 
protocols for this hearing are laid out in Standing Order 20-7 
(Mar. 23, 2020).1  The court finds that conducting this hearing 
via video — under the unique circumstances presented by the 
COVID-19 pandemic — is the best way to ensure the safety of the 
litigants, court personnel, and the public at large.  All 
findings made in the court’s prior standing orders are 
 
1 Standing Order 20-7 was extended to August 1, 2020 by 
Standing Order 20-21 (June 17, 2020).

incorporated herein.  See Standing Orders 20-5 (Mar. 20, 2020) 
and 20-21 (June 17, 2020).2 
The hearing held today will be an initial appearance and 
removal hearing for defendant Ghislaine Maxwell.  Today’s 
hearing has been noticed as a video hearing.  In the event 
defendant consents to proceed, the court makes the findings 
below.   
Before convening this video/telephone hearing, the court 
carefully considered the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to 
public court proceedings and the public’s and press’s First 
Amendment rights to in-person access to such proceedings.  See 
Bucci v. United States, 662 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing 
Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 48 (1984)); Press-Enter. Co. v. 
Superior Court of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 501, 509-
10 (1984).  This Order details my findings. 
II. 
Partial Rather Than Total Closure 
The court first finds that this video hearing constitutes a 
partial, rather than total, closure of these proceedings.  The 
court so finds because the goals of public access will still be 
achieved: this proceeding is not being held in secret and the 
public, including members of the press, maintains the

opportunity to access this proceeding in real time.  See 
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 593-97 
(1980) (Brennan, J., concurring) (discussing the functions of 
public access to court proceedings, including ensuring that 
procedural rights are respected and that justice is afforded 
equally, maintaining public confidence in the administration of 
justice, promoting accurate fact-finding, and enabling the 
public to act as a check on judicial power); see also Bucci, 662 
F.3d at 22 (discussing benefits of openness in criminal 
proceedings).  Under the extraordinary circumstances presented 
by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the court finds this 
partial closure is necessary. 
III. Findings in Support of Necessity for this Partial Closure  
A. First, the court finds that protecting the health and 
safety of the public and the parties to this proceeding 
from the spread of COVID-19 is a substantial interest that 
would be jeopardized and prejudiced if the court did not 
impose this partial closure.  
Since the first announced case in New Hampshire on March 2, 
2020, the state has reported 5,802 confirmed cases of COVID-19.3  
So far, 373 deaths have been attributed to the disease in this

state.  Further, in New Hampshire approximately 3,475 people are 
being monitored for signs of COVID-19 infection, over 120,307 
total tests have been reported (both positive and negative test 
results), and community-based transmission has been confirmed.4  
Nationally, the number of confirmed cases has grown to over 
2,797,737, with 130,984 cases resulting in death.5  
Given the contagious nature of the virus and the 
exponential growth in cases, COVID-19 presents an enormous 
danger to the health and safety of the public, including the 
litigants, security, and court personnel involved in this 
proceeding.  The court’s interest in preventing the spread of 
COVID-19 and preserving the health of all hearing participants, 
including the public, is a weighty and substantial interest that 
would likely be prejudiced if the court were not to impose this 
partial closure.  See United States v. Smith, 426 F.3d 567, 572-
73 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that U.S. Marshal’s policy after 
September 11th of requiring unknown visitors to court to produce 
photo identification constituted partial closure of courtroom

that was justified by substantial interest of promoting security 
and preventing terrorism). 
B. Second, the court finds that this partial closure of court 
proceedings is narrowly tailored to protect public health 
and safety and is less restrictive than the court’s current 
in-court hearing protocols. 
 Allowing the public to access these proceedings through 
telephone conference allows a large number (up to 500) of 
members of the public to access the proceedings while, at the 
same time, protecting the health of all involved by limiting the 
potential exposure of the public, parties, and court staff to 
COVID-19.  
Importantly, the court finds that, in light of the court’s 
current restrictions on the number of people permitted in the 
courtroom, providing public telephonic access is less 
restrictive than holding an in-person hearing which only a 
limited number of people can attend.  Further, via telephone, 
even individuals who would have otherwise been prohibited from 
entering the courthouse — for example, people who have tested 
positive for COVID-19 — now have access (even though virtual) to 
the proceedings.  See Standing Order 20-9 (Mar. 20, 2020) 
(prohibiting certain individuals from entering the courthouse, 
including people diagnosed with or exposed to someone diagnosed 
with COVID-19).  Providing the public access to this proceeding 
via telephone is the least restrictive means of protecting the

substantial interest of public health and safety.  See United 
States v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) 
(granting partial closure of courtroom to protect identity of 
undercover agents: courtroom was closed to public during 
undercover agents’ testimony but audio of testimony was live-
streamed into different courtroom during partial closure and 
transcripts of testimony were made available to public 
promptly). 
C. Third, the court has considered reasonable alternatives to 
this partial closure.  
The court has considered alternatives to this partial 
closure and finds they are neither reasonable nor feasible under 
the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and this case, 
particularly the necessity that this hearing be conducted 
promptly.   
IV. 
Conclusion 
In sum, the court finds that in this case a partial closure 
of court proceedings is necessary in that today’s hearing will 
be conducted by video and telephone conference.  This partial 
closure is justified by the substantial interest of protecting 
public health and safety from the spread of COVID-19 and is 
narrowly tailored to protect that interest.  The public 
maintains the opportunity to access these proceedings in full by 
telephone.
