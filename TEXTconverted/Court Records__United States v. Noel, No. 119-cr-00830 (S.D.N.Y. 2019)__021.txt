Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830 
 
 
 
 
Adjournment Request 
 
Dear Hon. Judge Torres: 
 
Pursuant to the Court’s request, I am making a written request that the April 20, 2020 
trial date be adjourned for at least 6 months. Firstly, the government in this matter sent out 
discovery on or about December 31, 2019. It was received in my office over the holiday break 
when no one was working. Thereafter, there was an issue with me being able to access the drive 
containing all of the information proffered by the government because we were given the wrong 
password by the government. Accordingly, I have had only about two weeks to review the 
voluminous discovery provided.  
 
The discovery ostensibly contains approximately 25,000 documents and hundreds of 
hours of video footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I will need at least an 
additional 60 days to review the discovery and discuss it with my client. Thereafter, I will still 
need to conduct an investigation based on the information and witness statements detailed in the 
discovery. Such an undertaking will take at the minimum another 60 days. As the Court can see, 
it will take me 90 days or more before I am in a position to know what additional discovery may 
be needed or what motions are appropriate. Additionally, this timeline doesn’t even account for 
issues regarding subpoenas, requests for additional discovery and attempting to locate witnesses 
or hire experts.

As previously noted, I intend on filing a motion for dismissal based on selective 
prosecution. If successful, this motion will entitle my client to additional discovery beyond what 
has previously been provided which also pushes the trial timeline beyond April of 2020. 
 
My client’s position is also that we are entitled to any and all reports, memorandums, 
witness statements and investigative reports written, produced or possessed by the inspector 
general regarding this incident and the Federal Bureau of Prison’s policy regarding written 
statements and employee conduct. 
 
It should be noted, that it took the justice department, the FBI, the inspector general’s 
office and an assortment of other federal agencies more than 90 days to investigate this matter. 
Accordingly, it is more than reasonable that it would take the defendant and his counsel, who 
have less than one percent of the man power and resources of the government, a significantly 
longer time to accomplish an adequate investigation and review of all the necessary information 
provided in this case. 
 
Respectfully yours,
