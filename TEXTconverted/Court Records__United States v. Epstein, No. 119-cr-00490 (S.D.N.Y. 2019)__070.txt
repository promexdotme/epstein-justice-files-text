United States v. Jeffrey Epstein,

United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
20 Cr. 330 (PAE) 
 
Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer: 
The Government writes respectfully to respond to the Court’s orders, dated July 31, 2025, 
directing the Government to provide additional information regarding grand jury materials the 
Government has asked the Court to unseal in these cases. (Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797). 
In particular, on July 18, 2025, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury 
transcripts from these cases, subject to appropriate redactions. (Epstein Dkt. 61; Maxwell 
Dkt. 785). The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63; 
Maxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submitted on July 29, 2025 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell 
Dkt. 796). In addition, the Court set a schedule whereby the defendants and victims could set out 
their positions on or before August 5, 2025. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3–4; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 4). 
On July 31, 2025, the Court directed the Government to provide additional information by 
August 4, 2025, in particular, in the Epstein case, a letter: 
1. 
Verifying the date(s) of all grand jury presentation(s) in this 
case; 
2. 
Providing all exhibits shown to grand jurors; 
3. 
Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand 
jury exhibits as well as the transcripts; 
4. 
Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits that are 
not already part of the public record (They may be redacted 
for any public release);

5. 
Analyzing how the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52) 
filed in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal 
authorities. 
(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional 
information by August 4, 2025, in particular, a letter: 
1. 
Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand 
jury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts. 
2. 
Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as 
redacted for public release, that are not already part of the 
public record. In making this assessment, the Government 
should take into account whether the unredacted portions of 
these exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this 
case, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or 
disclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP). 
3. 
Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the 
grand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that 
is not already part of the public record, taking into account 
the sources above. 
(Maxwell Dkt. 797). 
Because the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects, 
the Government respectfully submits this consolidated letter response.  
First, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in 
these cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large 
number of exhibits were admitted at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to 
judicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United 
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) (“the public has an especially strong right of 
access to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); United 
States v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d 181, 186 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (“trial exhibits are judicial 
documents to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting 
Amodeo, 71 F.3d at 1049)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any 
judicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during 
the Maxwell trial.  
The Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8, 
2025, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit 
the Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 70     Filed 08/05/25     Page 2 of 4

necessary redactions) any submissions to the Court by the victims identified in the grand jury 
transcripts, which are due to the Court on August 5, 2025. 
Second, the Epstein grand jury met on June 18, 2019, and July 2, 2019. The Maxwell grand 
jury met on June 29, 2020, July 8, 2020, and March 29, 2021. 
Third, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand 
jury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession. 
The Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury 
exhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its letter to the Court but did not have readily 
available at that time. 
Fourth, in connection with this letter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge 
Engelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that 
specifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware, 
publicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2025, many of the 
victims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by 
investigating law enforcement witnesses.  The enclosed, annotated transcripts show that much of 
the information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the 
identities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise 
been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses.1 
Fifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The 
Government, however, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand 
jury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to 
compare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell 
trial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the 
extent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the 
Court to supplement this letter no later than August 8, 2025, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge 
Berman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order. 
Sixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure. 
While the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]” 
when “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, 140 U.S. 575, 583 (1891), it did so in the 
context of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has 
explicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether 
to disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.), 
 
1 Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar 
analysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in 
the Court’s analysis of the In re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.

affirmed 147 F.2d 336 (5th Cir. 1945) (“The same jurisdiction that was sought in the beginning 
continues to exist insofar as the integrity and preservation of the minutia and minutes and 
proceedings of those steps are concerned. What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged 
by either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings. 
And the only jurisdiction over such matters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532 
F. Supp. 973, 978–79 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony 
after entry of a nolle prosequi). However, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis 
for the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 106 
(2d Cir. 1997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and 
that of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with 
these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”). 
Seventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant 
proceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the 
unsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at 
issue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With 
respect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously 
received victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein matters, the Government will over the 
coming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions. 
Finally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of 
victims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of 
these and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to 
modify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so 
as promptly as practicable. 
As always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.
