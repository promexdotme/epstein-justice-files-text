Adult Sex Offender Recidivism 
Observed recidivism rates of sex offenders are 
underestimates of actual reoffending. 
Sex crimes are one of the most underreported crimes 
and are often unseen by anyone other than the victim 
and perpetrator. Low reporting levels make it extremely 
difficult to estimate actual sexual recidivism rates. 
Additionally, only a small portion of sex offenses 
reported to law enforcement result in the offender's 
arrest. Therefore, it's generally recognized that observed 
recidivism rates are underestimates of the true reoffense 
rates of sex offenders. 
Sex offender recidivism is difficult to measure. 
Recidivism rates are measured differently from one study 
to the next, with different results. Studies differ in how 
recidivism is defined (i.e., rearrest vs. reconviction), how 
long offenders are followed and what types of offenders 
are included (i.e., rapists vs. child molesters). 
Recidivism rates of sex offenders range from 5 percent 
after 3 years to 24 percent after 15 years. 
Relatively low rates are reported in studies using observed 
sexual recidivism rates over follow-up periods shorter 
than 5 years. For example, a 2003 study (Langan, P., 
Schmitt, 
& Durose, M., "Recidivism of Sex Offenders 
Released From Prison in 1994," Bureau of Justice Statistics) 
found a sexual recidivism rate of about 5 percent using a 
3-year follow-up period for a large sample of sex offenders 
released from prison. Studies employing longer follow-up 
periods consistently report higher rates of recidivism. For 
example, a 2004 study (Harris, AJ.R., & Hanson, R.K., "Sex 
Offender Recidivism: A Simple Question," Public Safety 
and Emergency Preparedness Canada) reported sexual 
recidivism rates of 20 percent and 24 percent for a sample 
of sex offenders based on a 10-year and 15-year follow-up 
period, respectively. 
Sex offenders -
regardless of type -
have higher 
rates of general recidivism than sexual recidivism. 
Recidivism studies have consistently found that adult sex 
offenders have much higher rates of general reoffending 
than sexual reoffending. A 2004 study (Hanson, R.K., & 
Morton-Bourgon, K., "Predictors of Sexual Recidivism: An 
Updated Meta-Analysis," Public Safety and Emergency 
Measuring sex offender recidivism is 
difficult due to underreporting and different 
methods used in research studies. Studies 
with longer follow-up periods show that 
recidivism increases over time. Furthermore, 
different "types" of sex offenders have 
different recidivism rates. 
Preparedness Canada) analyzed findings from 95 studies 
and found that sex offenders had an average overall 
recidivism rate of 37 percent compared to an average 
sexual recidivism rate of 14 percent, based on follow-up 
periods of 5 to 6 years. This suggests that policies aimed at 
protecting the public from sex offender reoffense should 
be concerned with the likelihood of any form of serious 
recidivism, not just sexual recidivism. 
Female sex offenders reoffend at significantly lower 
rates than male offenders. 
Five- to six-year rates of sexual recidivism for female sex 
offenders may be as low as 1 to 3 percent. The empirical 
evidence regarding the different recidivism rates of female 
and male sex offenders suggests that intervention and 
management practices need to differentiate between 
female and male sex offenders, and that methods for 
assessing risk of male sex offenders are unlikely to be 
accurate when applied to female sex offenders (Cortoni, 
F., Hanson, R.K., & Coache, M.E., "The recidivism rates 
of female sex offenders are low: A Meta-Analysis," Sexual 
Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 22; 2010). 
Different types of sex offenders have different 
recidivism rates. 
Research examining the recidivism of rapists and child 
molesters indicates that the highest observed recidivism 
rates are found among child molesters who offend against 
boys. Comparatively lower recidivism rates are found 
for rapists, child molesters who victimize girls and incest 
offenders.
