PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES’  2- 7 NOTICE OF JOINDER IN PLAINTIFFS’  
JANE DOES 101 AND 102’S MOTION FOR NO-CONTACT ORDER  
 
 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 join in Plaintiffs Jane Does 101 and 102’s Motion for No-
Contact Order, filed May 22, 2009, and state as follows:   
1. 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 incorporate and adopt the facts set forth in the pending 
Motion for No-Contact Order.  Additionally, Plaintiffs offer additional facts in support of the 
Motion for a No-Contact Order, as set forth below.   
2. 
Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 were all identified on the 
victims list provided to Defendant Epstein’s counsel in connection with the Non-prosecution 
Agreement, and each has been identified as victims to Defendant Epstein in their pending

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 30   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 7

actions.  In June 2008, Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Pucillo ordered Defendant Epstein “not 
to have any contact, direct or indirect,” with any of his victims.  Judge Pucillo clarified that 
forbidden “indirect” contact included, but was not limited to, text messages, emails, telephone 
calls, or messages through third parties.  As detailed herein, Jane Does 4 and 7 have been 
contacted on multiple occasions by at least one person representing that she is cooperating with 
and communicating on behalf of Defendant Epstein.  In these contacts, the Plaintiffs/victims 
were threatened and harassed. 
3. 
As with other Plaintiffs, Jane Does 4 and 7 were first introduced to Defendant 
Epstein by Hayley Robson, who was a high school friend.1 
4. 
Robson had had contact with these Plaintiffs on several occasions in which she 
represented to Plaintiffs Jane Doe 4 and 7 that she is cooperating with Defendant Epstein’s 
attorneys and that she is being financially supported by Defendant Epstein.  Moreover, Robson 
has told these Plaintiffs specifically that she is communicating on behalf of Defendant Epstein.   
5. 
During these contacts, Robson made disparaging comments to the Plaintiffs and 
also sent disturbing text messages to Jane Doe No. 4.  In one text, Robson specifically stated, “I 
just met with my lawyer today and I’m finally done with the Epstein case. LOL. I knew you were 
suing Jeffrey all along and I’ve learned so much about you in the meantime. LOL.” Jane Doe 4 
understood this to mean that Robson had exchanged private information about Jane Doe 4 with 
Defendant Epstein and his attorneys.  Since February, 2009, Jane Doe 4 has continued to receive 
text messages from Robson that are sometimes harassing and other times seek information about 
Jane Doe 4’s private life, her lawsuit against Defendant Epstein, and/or her lawyer’s strategy.  
                                                
1 Ms. Robson was  named in at least one civil case against Mr. Epstein as a co-defendant.  See 
Jane Doe v. Epstein, case no. 50-2008-CA-0065996, Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Ms. 
Robson brought multiple underage girls to Epstein in addition to Jane Does 4 and 7.  
 
4
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 30   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 7

6. 
On one occasion, Robson approached Jane Doe 7 and disclosed that she was 
cooperating with Defendant Epstein’s defense, and that she (Robson) agreed that she would 
testify against Jane Doe 7 and the other plaintiffs to make sure that none of the Plaintiffs ever 
received any money from Defendant Epstein, making clear that her testimony would not be 
truthful to achieve this end.  She also made disparaging comments to Jane Doe 7, accusing her of 
ruining Defendant Epstein’s reputation.  
7. 
The very possibility of any contact with Epstein or his agents, including Robson, 
causes anxiety and distress particularly to Jane Doe 4 and 7, as well as the other Plaintiffs.  A no-
contact order should prevent further harassment of the Plaintiffs by Epstein and his agents, 
including, but not limited to, Hayley Robson.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7, respectfully join Plaintiffs Jane Does 101 and 
102 in moving this Court to enter an order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a No Contact Order 
prohibiting the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, from any contact or communication with Plaintiffs, 
either directly or indirectly, except through Plaintiffs’ attorneys of record for the duration of the 
Order.
