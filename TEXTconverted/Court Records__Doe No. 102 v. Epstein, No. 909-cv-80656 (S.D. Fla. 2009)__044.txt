PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES’  2- 7 MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE  
1. 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 are proceeding with a Jane Doe pseudonym as this case 
involves facts of the utmost intimacy and there is a genuine risk of psychological harm if their 
identities are disclosed.  
ORDER AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW  
 
 
Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-7 (“Plaintiffs” or individually, “Plaintiff”), by and through 
undersigned counsel, hereby file Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order, pursuant to 
S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1, and state as follows:   
See Exhibit “A” (Declaration of Gilbert Kliman, M.D.) (See also DE 
144, Jane Does’ 2-7 Response to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Identity, et al.).  
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 3 of 8

2. 
Despite the obvious need for Plaintiffs to have their identities protected, 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein has employed investigators who have made repeated contacts with ex-
boyfriends, former employers, and others who know nothing of the underlying facts of the case.  
These investigators have contacted such nonparties asking them for extensive personal 
information about a Plaintiff, such as names and contact information of former boyfriends and 
other friends and acquaintances in the Plaintiff’s community.    
3. 
The Defendant’s repeated contacts with these nonparties is harassing and 
designed to intimidate the Plaintiffs.  The purpose and intent of these contacts is to brand the 
Plaintiffs as alleged sexual abuse victims to their families, friends and communities.  
4. 
A Motion is pending in which this Court is being asked to determine whether and 
how Defendant may obtain discovery from nonparties. (DE 91, 144). Defendant’s investigative 
efforts improperly circumvent the issues in the pending Motion, and only serve to highlight the 
need for this Court to implement appropriate protective measures to prevent Defendant from 
harassing, intimidating, and intruding unnecessarily into the personal lives of the Plaintiffs. 
5. 
While it is not unusual for a defendant to use appropriate means to obtain records 
from former employers and others referenced in a plaintiff’s discovery responses, it is not 
customary for a defendant to retain private investigators to make personal contact with these 
individuals.  Indeed, this practice is particularly inappropriate in a sexual abuse case where these 
nonparties are unaware of the underlying abuse.  Plaintiffs have a well-grounded fear that the 
investigators will use the opportunity of their contacts with these nonparties to “out” the 
Plaintiffs’ as alleged childhood sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein. (See Kliman Decl., Exh. 
“A” hereto).

6. 
As an example of the investigators’ intimidation tactics, three of Defendant’s 
investigators recently called the former employer of Jane Doe 4 on repeated occasions over a 
two-day period, asking personal questions about her, including the name and telephone number 
of her ex-boyfriend.  See
7. 
Similarly, one of Defendant’s investigators contacted the former employer of Jane 
Doe 6.  
 Exhibit “B”, Declaration of Jane Doe 4. 
See
8. 
There is no basis for Defendant or his multiple investigators to make repeated 
personal contacts with former employers and ex-boyfriends to ask personal questions about a 
Plaintiff.  It is apparent that these contacts are not designed to obtain relevant information, but 
rather are intended to intimidate the Plaintiffs and to reveal that they are childhood sexual abuse 
victims. 
 Exhibit “C”, Declaration of Jane Doe 6. 
9. 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs request the entry of a protective order that would prevent 
Defendant, his attorneys and investigators from making ex parte contacts concerning this 
litigation with nonparties who have no knowledge that a Plaintiff was a childhood sexual abuse 
victim of Jeffrey Epstein.   
10. 
This Court has discretion to enter a protective order designed to protect a party 
from, among other things, annoyance or embarrassment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  As set forth above, 
given the investigators’ conduct, a protective order is appropriate to prevent unnecessary 
intrusion into the Plaintiffs’ personal lives and divulgation of Plaintiffs in their communities as 
childhood sexual abuse victims.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7, respectfully request that this Court grant 
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order, as follows: (i) order Defendant, his attorneys and 
investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties identified in plaintiffs’ discovery 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 5 of 8

responses, such as, for example, former employers; (ii) order Defendant, his attorneys and 
investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties found during the course of 
discovery or investigation who know the Plaintiff or live in her community, such as, for example, 
current and former boyfriends and family friends of the Plaintiffs; (iii) order Defendant, his 
attorneys and investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties who otherwise 
know one of the Plaintiffs personally but who are unaware that she is an alleged victim of 
childhood sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein; and (iv) grant all such other relief this Court deems 
just and appropriate.    
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 7.1.A.3 
 
Undersigned counsel has conferred with Defendant’s counsel in a good faith effort to 
resolve the issues raised in this motion, and has been unable to do so, as Defendant’s counsel has 
advised that Defendant opposes this motion.
