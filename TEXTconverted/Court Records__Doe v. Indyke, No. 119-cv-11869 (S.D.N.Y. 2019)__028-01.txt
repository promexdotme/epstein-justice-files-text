CO-EXECUTORS' STATUS REPORT ON CONTINUING 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH VOLUNTARY COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND 
REQUEST FOR RULING 
' -.. 
Come now the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"). 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN. and provide the Court with this Status Report 
on their continuing efforts to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program 
(the "Program") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims again.st Jeffrey E. Epstein. deceased. 
If the Program fails to launch, it will be an extraordinary lost opportunity for 
eligible claimants to receive compensation and voluntarily resolve their claims of sexual abuse 
against Mr. Epstein through a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. And there will 
be only one culprit: the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands. Despite weeks of negotiation with 
the Attorney General's representatives -
who prefer to file misleading "status reports" with the 
Court rather than engage in actual, good-faith discussions -·· the Co-Executors are no closer than 
before to having the Attorney General lift her liens on the Estate's accounts so that the Program

• 
can receive un s essentia 1or its operations. 
The Co-Executors and the Attorney General agree on one point: both now seek a 
ruling from the Court that will enable the Program to go forward. The Co-Executors disagree, 
however, on the appropriate issue before the Court. According to the Attorney General, "[her] 
Office seeks a ruling from this Court as to whether the Program, as proposed, should be approved, 
or whether additional concessions, as outlined by the Attorney General, and in the better interests

of the victims, are required for its approval and fair administration." 1 That is not the correct 
question: rather, it is whether the Co-Executors have acted in accordance with their fiduciary 
obligations imposed by USVI law on executors of estates. 
As the Court noted during the February 4, 2020 hearing (the "February 4 Hearing"), 
the Co-Executors function as an arm of the Coutt and are vested by law with the responsibility of 
administering the Estate. The actual issue before the Court is whether the Program that the Co-
Executors seek to implement is consistent with their fiduciary duties. As Your Honor recognized, 
the Program as originally designed is not only consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Co-
Executors, but, in fact '' ... we agreed that everybody believes this program is a great program .. . " 
(February 4 Hearing Tr. at 113:24-25.) 
Accordingly, the Co-Executors ask that the Court grant their Expedited Motion for 
Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, filed November 14, 2019, and allow 
the Co-Executors to move forward with the Program as originally conceived. 
Background 
More than seven months ago, the Co-Executors sought to establish the Program by 
interviewing numerous highly-qualified candidates for the role of independent claims program 
designer and administrator. The individuals selected -
Jordana Feldman, Kenneth Feinberg, and 
Camil\e Biros- are the gold standard, with unparalled experiencT in that regard. 2 Designed and 
to be implemented by independent, nationally recognized claims administration experts, with input

Executors' Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Program, filed November 14, 2019;

from interested parties including claimants and their representatives, the Program seeks to timely 
resolve claims through a process that is sensitive to the experiences and concerns of claimants and 
treats them with compassion, dignity, and respect. 
On February 4, 2020, the Court held an extensive hearing on the bonafides of the 
Program, taking detailed testimony .from Program Administrator Jordana Feldman and Program 
Designer Kenneth Feinberg. (February 4 Hearing Tr. at 103:12-186:14.) The Court also heard 
repeated approval of the Program from the multiple claimants' counsel present at that hearing. (Id. 
84: 11-85:2; 85:6-19; 92:24-93:8.) As noted above, the Court recognized toward the end of the 
hearing that the Program is widely viewed as an important, positive step for both claimants and 
the Estate. (Id. at 113:24-25 ('THE COURT: ... I think we agreed that everybody believes this 
program is a great program ... ").) Only one person, alone among all involved, opposes the 
Program: the Attorney General. 3 To hold the Program hostage, the Attorney General issued 
Criminal Activity Liens freezing the Estate's accounts, including funds necessary to staff and 
operate the Program.4 
At the conclusion of the February 4 hearing, the Court urged the Co-Executors and 
the Attorney General's representatives to see if they could come to an agreement on funding the 
Program. (Id. 112:4-12; 204:4-10.) Incredibly, the Attorney General tells the Court (twice) that 
it wrote to the Estate on February I 0, 2020, but "received no response."5 That is false: on February 
12, 2020, counsel for the Estate wrote a six-page letter to the Attorney General addressing each of

Liens, dated March 17, 2020).

the points raised in her letter two days earlier. [Exhibit A] And now, more than five weeks later, 
the Attorney General continues to seek to accomplish her previously-stated goal of scuttling the 
Program before it has a chance to succeed. 
Recent Developments 
On February 28, 2020, the Attorney General -
who has no experience whatsoever 
with claims resolution programs -
presented the Co-Executors with an eleven-point laundry list 
of changes she demanded to the Program's funding, structure, and operations.6 In their continued 
effort to make the Program a reality, the Co-Executors agreed to eight of those demands without 
substantial change; as to the other three, the Co-Executors agreed to the extent their fiduciary 
duties allow them.7 Each of these three latter items is discussed below. 
1. 
The Attorney General Demands that Her Personally-Selected Candidate, a 
Biased Advocate with No Claims Administration Experience, Become a Co-
Eg ual Program Administrator 
The Attorney General demands that Professor Marci Hamilton, a legal academic in 
child sexual abuse at the University of Pennsylvania, assume a role in the Program co-equal with 
Ms. Feldman as Program Administrator. 8 But Ms. Hamilton has no experience in mass tort claims 
resolution, and shoe-horning her into that inappropriate role will force the Estate to incur 
substantial additional time and expense with no commensurate benefit to the Program. That is not 
just the Co-Executor's view: the Progri,tm Administrator and the Program Designers unanimously I 
6. See Gov't. March 18 Status Report, at Exhibit B. 
7. 
Bizarrely, the Attorney General reports that she offered the "concession[]" that the Estate's cooperation with law 
enforcement not be tied to her approval of the Program. (Gov't. March 18 Status Report, at 3 .) The Co-Executors 
are extensions of the Court; they neither need nor require the Attorney General's ·'concession" to uphold their 
fiduciary duties to the Estate or cooperate with legitimate law enforcement efforts. 
8. See Gov't. March 18 Status Report. at 2.

oppose this role for Ms. Hamilton. The Court had the opportunity to hear Ms. Feldman testify 
about her experience and to explain her efforts to address the views of all those interested in the 
design and the implementation of the Program. And, before the Attorney General raised Ms. 
Hamilton's candidacy, not a single claimants' counsel raised any concern about Ms. Feldman's 
qualifications, expertise or independence from the Estate. 
Nor would hiring Ms. Hamilton in the role demanded by the Attorney General be 
consistent with the Co-Executors' fiduciary duties. Ms. Hamilton's outspoken views on the 
purported criminality of Mr. Epstein and those around him reveal her deep-seated bias against the 
Estate. It is rich irony that the Attorney General compares Ms. Hamilton's proposed role to that 
of a neutral arbitrator.9 In this matter, Ms. Hamilton is as far from a neutral party as one could 
possibly be: her public statements -
on television, in opinion pieces and in multiple news articles 
-
are replete with her strong, loudly-voiced bias against Decedent and anyone who knew him 
when he was alive, such that she believes the Estate should be drained of all assets without regard 
to any nexus to individual claims. Here are but a few examples: 
"It took us 16 years, but New York will be the epicenter for taking 
down the powerful who sexually abused children in New York. It 
will start to happen this year -
in the civil courts. That is because 
there is another path that justice will take to force the facts into the 
public square: On Aug. 14, the one-year look-back window in the 
New York Child Victims Act will kick into effect. When it does, 
every girl who was sexually abused through Epstein's scheme will 
be able to sue for civil damages the ones who caused the abuse. 
Epstein is wealthy and so are many of his friends who enjoyed 
spending time partying with him when these girls -
lured into 
doing 'massages' for much-needed cash- were turned into victims 
of a wealthy sex-trafficking ring. The CV A will level the playing 
field by handing these women potent legal weapons. It's a new 
world, and it's finally getting close to fair." Marci Hamilton, New

"Marci Hamilton, a child sex-abuse expert and founder of the 
nonprofit think tank CHILD USA, alleges that there's 'no question' 
that the men who palled around with Epstein must have noticed the 
presence of underage girls. 'There's also no question that they had 
to have known that these girls were supposedly providing massages 
-
and that should have been warning bells all over the place,' 
Hamilton added.'' (Meera Jagannathan, Marke/Watch, July 14, 
2019 ("Amid new Jeffrey Epstein allegations. here's how to help a

of

"Have you noticed that the latest in the Jeffrey Epstein child sex-
trafficking scandal has focused on the powerful men involved, from 
Epstein to President Trump, Alex Acosta, Bill Clinton, Ken Starr, 
Alan Dershowitz and New York Attorney Geoffrey Berman? To be 
sure, these men-except for Berman-operated together to 
empower Epstein to abuse far more girls than he might have 
otherwise, and that is newsworthy." 
(Marci Hamilton, Miami 
Herald, July 14, 2019 ("Epstein's victims deserve to find justice in 
civil 
court, 
too"; 
available 
at 
https://www.miamiherald-
com/opinion/op-ed/article 232663662.html). 
··Basically, this failure to protect children is a political problem 
across the culture . . . This is outrageous that the [Epstein] victims 
themselves were not even part of the negotiation process. The 
arrogance of [ ] Epstein .. .in this situation is overwhelming ... 
These women were sexually abused as children, one after the other. 
Dozens of them ... This is exactly what is wrong with our society." 
(Marci Hamilton, The Rachel Maddow Show, D,ecember 3, 2018;

cabinet-members-s-leniency-towed-sex-offender-stirs-outrage-
13 87 897923 761 ). 
That is not a criticism of Ms. Hamilton -
as a zealous advocate for children, she 
is of course entitled to voice her deeply-held beliefs. But it does disqualify her as any sort of a 
"neutral" voice in hearing and determining claims through the Program.

Despite Ms. Hamilton's obvious bias against the Estate and those around Mr. 
Epstein, the Co-Executors still sought to find a way in which her expertise on relevant issues might 
be used to benefit claimants, while at the sai:ne time avoiding opportunities for her prejudice, to 
mar the Program Administrator's independent, neutral determinations. 
In their efforts .at 
continuing compromise, the Co-Executors proposed to the Attorney General that Ms. Hamilton 
play an extensive consulting role with the Program, a significant concession given Ms. Hamilton's 
bias: 
'·Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expe1t, 
leading legal academic and advocate of victim's rights, will work closely 
with the Program Administrator to complement the Program's resources. 
Ms. Hamilton's role will be to further inform the Administrator and her staff 
about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse. 
and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the 
Administrator in developing or updating policies and procedures; to advise 
the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in interactions with 
victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing 
post-determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling 
or other services." 
(See email from Daniel H. Weiner to Linda Singer dated March 16, 2020, annexed as Exhibit D to 
the Government's March 18, 2020 Status Report.) 10 
Regrettably, the Attorney General rejected that generous proposal out-of-hand in 
her latest public filing. 11 
10. While the Attorney General purports to quote the Co-Executors' proposal, she leaves out entirely this extensive 
description of the role offered to Ms. Hamilton. (Gov't. March 18 Status Report. al 4.) That is disingenuous in 
the extreme.

2. 
The Attorney General Demands that the Co-Executors Restrict Funds 
Available to Claimants Under the Program 
The Attorney General also demands that the Co-Executors "set aside'' -
i.e., make 
unavailable to claimants seeking compensation through the Program -
$40 million for the next 
three years. 12 Restricting the Estate's funds available to pay compensation determinations under 
the Program is anathema to the Co-Executors -
after all, one of the primary attractions of the 
Program is that all of the Estate's funds are available to it. Removing $40 million from the Estate's 
assets available to the Program -
on top of the Attorney General's demand that, to ensure she 
gets paid if she prevails in her CICO action against the Estate, the Estate also '·set aside" Little St. 
James Island, Great Saint James Island, and $73.1 million in cash for past tax incentives -
risks 
leaving the Program with insufficient funds to make good on its promise of speedy. just 
compensation. 
As a compromise, the Co-Executors offered to set aside $25 million in assets for 
eighteen months, a time period that will extend well beyond the expected term of the Program. 
The Attorney General did not respond to the Co-Executors' good-faith compromise proposal. 
3. 
The Attorney General Demands that the Co-Executors Report to Her 
Information Not Required by Virgin Islands Law 
Finally, the Attorney General demands that, in addition to performing their 
fiduciary duties to the Court by accounting f9r all items concerning the Estate in accordance with 
Virgin Islands law, the Co-Executors also report to the Attorney General on matters and entities 
outside the probate proceeding. Once again, that is inappropriate: the Attorney General, an active 
12 The Attorney General initially insisted that any unused funds from this set-aside be donated to charity. That 
would constitute a direct breach of the Co-Executors' obligations under Virgin Islands law.

litigant against the Estate, has no right to usurp the Court's authority to oversee the Co-Executors' 
administration of the Estate. 13 
* 
* 
* 
* 
As the Attorney General continues to prolong her refusal to fund the Program -
finding one pretext after another to claim she simply wants to improve the Program, while taking 
actions that would remove over $200 million from the Program and make it more costly and less 
effective -
the Estate is forced to actively litigate scores of cases that could otherwise have been 
resolved through the Program. As a result, both claimants and the Estate are expending precious 
resources that would have been far better used in resolving claims through the Program. 14 
lt is now-or-never for the Program. Accordingly, the Co-Executors .ask the Court 
to allow the Co-Executors to continue to perform their fiduciary duties, and -
for the benefit of 
all stakeholders in the Estate, including those who seek to participate in the Program -
grant their 
motion to establish the Program as originally conceived and presented to the Court on November 
14, 2019. 
13. The Attorney General also takes a cheap shot at Program Designer Kenneth Feinberg, citing nine-year-old 
criticism of Mr. Feinberg in the BP Deepwater Horizon litigation. (Gov't. March 18 Status Report at 6 and Exhibit 
E.) Yet the court in that case expressly found that Mr. Feinberg was '•independent" in the sense that BP did not 
control his evaluation of individual claims. (Id. Exh. D at p. I I.) And Mr. Feinberg is not the Program 
Administrator here - Ms. Feldman is. 
14. The Attorney General's interference has forced the Estate to litigate against numerous plaintiffs who would have 
participated in the Program if they had the opportunity to do so. As we emphasized to the Court at our February 
21, 2020 conference, the Co-Executors affirmatively decided to reduce litigation ( and the adversity inherent in it) 
by making the Program available to litigants as well as to those who were harmed but either were not prepared to 
litigate in a public forum, or barred from recovery through the courts due to statute of I imitations or other reasons. 
The Attorney General's actions have had the unfortunate effect of pitting many plaintiffs against the Estate. That 
is precisely the opposite of what the Co-Executors sought and the Court endorsed at the February 4 Hearing.

Attorney General George: 
February 12, 2020 
As promised in my e-mail to you dated February 10, 2020, we write in response to 
your letter sent earlier that day regard_ing the formation of the voluntary compensation 
program -
officially known as the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the 
"Program") -
proposed by the Co-Executors in November 2019 and endorsed by • 
Superior Court Judge Hermon-Percell ~d multiple claimants' counsel at the Court's 
hearing held on February 4, 2020 (the "February 4 Hearing"). We believe your letter 
I 
misapprehends both the Court's direction to the Co-Executors and the Attorney 
General's limited role in this matter, and that your suggestions concerning the purpose, 
structure and administration of the Program are far outside the scope of the single issue 
as to which the Court requested that we confer.

The Program is Designed and Will be Administered by the Nation's 
Leading Experts in the Field. 
. 
. 
As your representatives have no doubt reported to you, both Program 
Ad~trator Jordana_ H. Feldman and Program Designer Kenneth R. Feinberg testified 
at length at the February 4 Hearing. Nationally renowned and respected experts in the 
highly specialized field of mass tort claims resolution, Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg, and 
their colleague Camille Biros have extraordinary experience in administering programs 
addressing the Catholic ~hurch's sexual abuse scandal, the Pennsylvania State 
University sexual abuse scandal, the Boeing 737 Max airplane crashes, the General 
Motors transmission recall, the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, the BP Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, the Boston Marathon bombing, the September 11th terrorist attacRs, and 
victims of exposure to Agent Orange, DES and asbestos, as well as several other mass 
torts. 
Both Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg testified regarding their absolute 
independence from the Co-Executors in resolving through the Program claims of sexual 
abuse against Mr. Epstein, explaining that such independence is the sine qua non of their 
agreement to design and implement the Program. Far from questioning the capabilities, 
integrity, or independence of Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg, the multiple stateside and 
Virgin Islands counsel for nearly three dozen individual claimants present at the 
February 4 Hearing supported the Program and the manner in which it was expeditiously

Other than your counsel, no one in the courtroom (or elsewhere) voiced any 
objections to the Program, which - as designed by Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. 
Biros -
will provide claimants with an entirely voluntary, easily accessible, non-
adversarial alternative to protracted civil litigation. 
As Judge Hermon-Percell 
appropriately concluded at the February 4 Hearing, the Program has the potential to save 
enormous amounts of time, risk, and money for both individual cl~ts and the Estate. 
2. 
The Court Urged the Co-Executors to Consult with the Attorney General 
on a Single Issue: Providing Adequate Funding for the Program. 
. 
. 
Your Office previously raised several objections to the Programl; each was 
addressed in detail at the February 4 Hearing. As the testimony of Ms. Feldman and Mr. 
Feinberg elucidated, those critiques were either misguided or mistaken, or both. 2 While 
there are various possible permutations in developing the precise details of a 
compensation mechanism, the Program designed by Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. 
Biros - with substantial input from claimants' counsel - is cost-effective, fair and just. 
Perhaps most important, the Program is already well underway. As you know, 
and as Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg testified, they have been working on the Program 
1. See Opposition to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, dated 
January 23, 2020. 
2. Your February 10 letter indicates your Office's lingering confusion on certain aspects of the Program. 
For example, the Co-Executors have not jettisoned the concept of individual claimants signing releases 
if, and only if, those individuals elect to accept the compensation offered by the Program Administrator. 
It would be nonsensical for the Co-Executors to do so, since the Estate would otherwise risk being 
dragged back into litigation through third-party demands for contribution or indemnification. Given 
the Estate's need for legal finality and claimants' unfettered ability to pursue their claims in other fora, 
including through the courts, it is no surprise that - as both Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg testified 
- such releases are commonplace in mass tort compensation programs. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 15 of 20
since well before the Co-Executors announced the "Establishment of the Epstein Victims' 
Compensation Program" on November 14, 2019 - almost three months ago. As Ms. 
Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and counsel for the claimants made clear at the February 4 
Hearing, they have been working diligently and cooperatively to develop a Protocol for 
Judge Hermon-Percell's review and approval. 
Mr. Epstein died on August 10, 2019 - six months ago. You only first expressed 
disagreement with the Program when you filed your Complaint in the Superior Court on 
January 15, 2020. You did not seek to intervene in the Probate Court until January 23, 
2020 or issue your liens until January 31, 2020. The concerns you now express raise an 
obvious question as to why you didn't propose a different compensation program before 
filing these pleadings - which taken together amount to an effort to block or at least 
substantially delay the Program. You certainly had every opportunity to contact the Co-
Executors or Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg, or Ms. Biros and present your concerns and 
make your suggestions to improve the existing Program, but chose not to do so. And 
while this is neither the time nor the place to address each of your purported concerns 
about the Program, it ~s worth emphasizing that your letter is long on C!iticisms -
misplaced in our view -- and woefully short on;solutions. 
The bottom line is that the claimants have invested in the Program and both the 
Estate and the claimants are already incurring significant resources unnecessarily 
litigating while you are delaying the Program. That is something no one who is truly 
concerned about conserving Estate resources and offering claimants an alternative to 
litigation should desire.

As the Co-Executors pointed out in their.recent filings in the Superior Court,3 it is 
for the Court, not your Office, to oversee administration of the Estate and determine the 
propriety of the Co-Executors' actions under Virgin Islands law. There is only one point 
remaining to be discussed: how best to provide adequate funds for the Program. On this 
issue, the Co-Executors have made their position clear since the outset -
they have 
placed no limits, either individually or in the aggregate, on the compensation that 
individual claimants may receive under the Program. That is the very best that the Co-
Executors can do for existing and potential cla~ts, as they exercise their fiduciary 
duties under Virgin Islands law in administering the Estate. Your efforts seem singularly 
designed to thwart the proper exercise of these fiduciary duties to the substantial 
detriment of all such claimants. 
As you know, the Co-Executors believe that the liens placed by your Office on the 
Estate's assets are improper and invalid under Virgin Islands law. It is for that reason 
that they seek judicial relief from those liens, which if left in place will cause irreparable 
harm to the Estate's property - including assets that would otherwise be available to 
fund the Program. Already, the Co-Executors' ability to preserve the Estate's assets have 
been1 severely undercut. The enclosed check written tq an exterminator needed to 
preserve one of the properties is the first of what will be many checks to bounce as a result 
of the lien imposed by your Office on the Estate's operating bank account. This is the first 
3. See Supplemental Brief Regarding Co-Executors' Obligations to Satisfy Expenses of Administration 
Notwithstanding Liens Issued to "The Estate," dated January 31, 2020; Emergency Motion for Order 
Releasing Funds for Administration of Estate, dated February 10, 2020. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 17 of 20
of what will become an avalanche of harms to the Estate. Your lien has also stripped the 
Co-Executors of their ability to meet payroll, and prevents them from paying electric, 
water, and other basic bills. As a result of your actions, all the Estate's assets - including 
the islands in St. Thomas - will rapidly lose value. Likewise, the impact on the properties 
in Paris, New York City, and Florida if the Estate is unable to pay for their operating and 
maintenance expenses will likely be swift and severe. And it will be hard if not 
impossible to rehire staff once they are forced to seek alternative employment. The harm 
will be irreparable and substantial. Most disappointing and in disregard of the Court's 
request, your Office is holding the Program hostage, thereby threatening to derail a 
vitally important process for claimants to obtain justice. 
The Co-Executors continue to hope that you will reverse your Office's position. In 
the interests of all concerned, the Co-Executors remain willing to work with you on how 
best to adequately fund the Program. Time is of the essence if the Program, and the hopes 
of those women who are eager to use it, are to survive. 
Respectfully,
