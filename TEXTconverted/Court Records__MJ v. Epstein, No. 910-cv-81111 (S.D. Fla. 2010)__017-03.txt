the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.  In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
privileges, the information sought is privileged and confidential, and

Reply to Epstein’s Response: 
 
 
These requests simply seek information that the federal government gave to 
Epstein in the course of its plea discussions with him.  Remarkably, Epstein claims that 
these materials – which started in the government’s possession -- are now somehow 
transformed and given Fifth Amendment protection by his mere receipt of them.  The 
Fifth Amendment does not work such alchemy. 
 
It is true, of course, that the Fifth Amendment covers situations where the act of 
producing documents has “communicative aspects of its own, wholly aside from the 
contents of the papers produced.”  Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 410 (1976).  
But this “act of production” doctrine has stringent limits.  It does not extend, for example, 
to a claim by a taxpayer that he would incriminate himself by producing his accountant’s 
work papers.  As the Supreme Court has explained, the government’s awareness of  
these documents was “a foregone conclusion” and therefore their production could be 
required:

                CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON

It is doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession 
of the papers rises to level of testimony within the protection of the Fifth 
Amendment.  The papers belong to the accountant, were prepared by 
him, and are the kind usually prepared by an accountant working on the 
tax returns of his client.  Surely the Government is in no way relying on the 
“truthtelling” of the taxpayer to prove the existence of . . . the documents.  
The existence and location of the papers are a foregone conclusion. 
 
Fisher, 425 U.S. at 410 (emphasis added).   
 
 
Courts applying this “foregone conclusion” standard to various fact patterns have 
asked whether the government was aware of the documents’ existence apart from any 
actions of the defendant.  Thus, United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000), rejected 
the Government’s argument that it was a foregone conclusion that the defendant 
possessed “ordinary business records.”  The Court noted that the government had no 
“prior knowledge” of these records: 
Whatever the scope of this “foregone conclusion” rationale, the facts of 
this case plainly fall outside of it.  While in Fisher the Government already 
knew that the documents were in the attorney’s possession and could 
independently confirm their existence and authenticity through the 
accountants who created them, here the Government has not shown that 
it had any prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of 
the 13,120 pages of documents ultimately produced by respondent.   
 
Id. at 44 (emphasis added). 
 
In this case, of course, the government’s “prior knowledge” of the documents that 
Jane Doe seeks is obviously and undeniably a foregone conclusion.  The government 
itself gave Epstein the documents!  Therefore, there is no plausible argument that, in 
producing these documents to Jane Doe, Epstein will somehow be incriminating himself 
by disclosing to the government something that it does not already know.  The 
government clearly has prior knowledge of documents that it gave to Epstein.  Here,

then, the “existence and location of the documents . . . are a ‘foregone conclusion’ and 
[Epstein] . . . adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government’s information by 
conceding that he in fact has the documents.”  In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Dated April 
18, 2003, 383 F.3d 905, 910 (9th Cir. 2004).   
 
The D.C. Circuit has recently refused to extend the act of production doctrine to 
facts very similar to those here.  In United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313 (D.C. Cir. 
2006), federal prosecutors sought information about possible crimes committed by a 
defense attorney in the course of representing a defendant in a federal case.  The 
prosecutors subpoenaed the attorney to produce all correspondence between him and 
courts and prosecutors in that case.  In summarily rejecting an argument that producing 
the documents would somehow fall within the act of production doctrine of the Fifth 
Amendment, the D.C. Circuit explained that “the government must have known of the 
existence of documents . . . because it was a party to that correspondence.”  Id.  at 325. 
The Circuit further explained that the government’s subpoena need not “name every 
scrap of paper that is produced.  Because the government already had sufficient 
knowledge about the . . . [case-related] documents, . . . [the defense attorney] was 
simply surrendering them, not testifying, by complying with those demands in the 
subpoena.”  Id.  Other cases similarly reject attempts to use an act of production shield 
to turning over documents whose existence is known to the government or is a foregone 
conclusion.  See, e.g. In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, 1 
F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir. 1993) (rejecting act of production argument because compliance 
with subpoena requiring production of a personal calendar “would require mere

surrender of the calendar, and not testimony” (internal quotation omitted)); United 
States v. Clark, 847 F.2d 1467, 1473 (10th Cir. 1988) (accounting records not subject to 
act of production protection; in producing records the defendant would not “authenticate 
the documents as being his own or being accurate”); Securities and Exchange 
Commission v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., 843 F.2d 74, 76 (2d Cir. 1988) (rejecting act 
of production argument regarding bank records because “everybody knew that they 
existed”); ]”); United States v. Lang, 792 F.2d 1235, 1242 (4th Cir. 1986) (rejecting act 
of production argument regarding bank records because an IRS agent “had been given 
access to and has examined some or all of the records” and thus the defendants “act of 
producing those records would add little or nothing to the sum total of the Government’s 
knowledge of the existence and location of the summoned records”). 
 
Rather than discuss specific case law about the act of production doctrine, 
Epstein retreats into mere generalities.  Thus, he asserts that giving to Jane Doe the 
discovery produced by the government might disclose witnesses helpful to Jane Doe.  
Epstein’s Resp. at 7. But this assertion badly confuses how the Fifth Amendment works.  
Of course, the government’s documents have information that might be harmful to 
Epstein’s claims of innocence; presumably that is why the government was showing him 
the documents in the first place to convince him to plead guilty to a crime.  But it is a 
“settled proposition that a person may be required to produce specific documents even 
though they contain incriminating assertions of fact or belief . . . .”  United States v. 
Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 35 (2000).  The only question here is whether turning over the 
government’s own documents to Jane Doe somehow forces Epstein to provide

“testimony” to the government – something forbidden by the Fifth Amendment.  Epstein 
has no such viable claim here. 
   
Epstein also argues that the magistrate judge’s earlier omnibus order (doc. # 339 
in case no. 9:08-CV-80119) requires that request for production be denied.  This is 
untrue for several reasons.  First, the earlier requests that were apparently denied2 were 
broader than the narrow requests made by Jane Doe.  The earlier requests included, for 
example, a request for all documents “relating to” the federal non-prosecution 
agreement (Production Request No. 2), all documents “relating to” Epstein’s Florida 
guilty plea (Production Request No. 3), and all documents obtained in “investigation 
relating to” either the federal or state criminal investigations.  See Epstein’s Resp. at 8 
(quoting those requests).  Such overbroad requests might require Epstein to effectively 
make “use of the content of his mind” in identifying which documents were responsive.  
See Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 43.  But here Jane Doe has propounded far narrower requests 
that do not require any mind to pick and choose.  Indeed, Jane Doe’s request is 
significantly narrower that other requests that the United States Supreme Court and 
other courts have upheld.  See, e.g., Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 394 (1976) 
(rejecting Fifth Amendment challenge to subpoena requesting “accountant’s workpapers 
pertaining to Dr. E.J. Mason’s books and records of 1969, 1970, and 1971); United 
States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313, 325 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (rejecting Fifth Amendment 
challenge to subpoena requesting  “[a]ny and all correspondence between the Law 
                                                 
2   The magistrate judge’s order on this point actually states that it was Epstein’s motion to quash that was “denied.”  
See Order at 17 (“Defendant’s Motion as it relates to Production Requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20 is 
denied.” (emphasis added)).  Read in context, it appears that the magistrate judge intended to state that the 
defendant’s motion was granted.

Offices of Navron Ponds [the defendant] and courts and prosecutors in the matter of 
U.S. v. Jerome Harris” (internal bracketing omitted)); United States v. Clark, 847 F.2d 
1467, 1473 (10th Cir. 1988) (rejecting Fifth Amendment challenge to subpoena 
requesting “all records pertaining to the performance of any accounting service by [one 
named person to another named person. 
 
The magistrate judge’s earlier order is also not controlling here for a second 
reason.  That order was entered in a case that has been consolidated with Jane Doe’s 
case for discovery purposes.  But Jane Doe was not a party to the earlier ruling and did 
not have the opportunity to provide briefing and argument before the magistrate judge 
ruled.  In this case, of course, Jane Doe has had that opportunity and has now provided 
recent precedents clearly dictating that her specific motion should be granted.  See, 
e.g., United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313, 325 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Fifth Amendment 
privilege does not extend to correspondence to which the government was a party).   
 
Epstein also argues some sort of attorney-client or work-product privilege bars 
production of the documents.  This argument is frivolous.  The attorney-client privilege, 
for example, extends only to a “confidential communication” made in the course of 
“rendition of legal services to the client.”  Fla. Stat. Ann. § 90.502(2).  Documents given 
by the government to Epstein are obviously not confidential communications within the 
sense of the attorney client privilege.  Similarly, the documents are not work product, 
because they do not involve any creation by Epstein’s attorneys.  See, e.g., Balboa v. 
State, 446 So.2d 1134, 1135 (Fla. App. 1984) (“opinions, theories, or conclusions of 
attorneys are privileged, but statements of witnesses to attorneys are not”).

Epstein finally claims that the information is protected by Federal Rules of 
Evidence 408 and 410, regarding settlement discussions and plea negotiations.  Those 
federal rules3 have no bearing Jane Doe’s requests for production number 7 and 9, 
which seek respectively discovery provided by the government and “evidentiary 
materials” provided by the government.  These are simply not “offers to compromise,” 
Fed. R. Evid. 408, or “plea discussions,” Fed. R. Evid. 410, to which the rules apply.   
While Rules 408 and 410 do not covers requests number 7 and 9, they 
potentially cover Jane Doe’s request number 10, seeking correspondence regarding the 
plea discussions in this case.  These rules, however, provide no valid basis for resisting 
Jane Doe’s discovery requests.  Discovery is, of course, permitted “regarding any 
nonprivileged matter that is relevant” to Jane Doe’s claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) 
(emphasis added).  The Rules of Evidence regarding settlement discussions do not 
create any privileges.  It is possible that Epstein may argue that these rules ultimately 
bar the use of certain evidence at trial.  If these arguments are made, Jane Doe will 
respond in due course.4  But under the discovery rules “[r]elevant information need not 
be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).  Thus, discovery is “construed 
broadly to encompass any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to 
                                                 
3  Epstein also cites several analogous state rules of evidence, which are likewise inapplicable for the 
reasons explained regarding the federal rule.   
4   Both rules contains exemptions, allowing such evidence to be used to prove such things as “state of 
mind,”  “bias and prejudice,” or other things apart from mere liability for the matter under discussion.  See, 
e.g., United States v. Peed, 714 F.2d 7, 9-10 (4th Cir. 1983) (admitting defendant’s offer to return missing 
property because it appeared motivated by purpose of persuading victim to drop criminal charges rather 
than to compromise civil claim).  The Florida rules that Epstein cites, even though not applicable in this 
federal case, are also subject to similar exemptions.

another matter that could bear on any issue that is or may be in the case.”  
Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 352 (1978).  The correspondence 
with the government agencies may well point Jane Doe in the direction of admissible 
evidence, and therefore Epstein should be compelled to provide the correspondence 
sought in request number 10.   
 
In a last desperate attempt to thwart production, Epstein appeals to “third-party 
privacy rights.”  Epstein’s Resp. at 11.  Given the extent to which Epstein’s hired 
investigators have concluded interrogations of anyone even remotely connected with 
this case, this appeal to privacy interests rings rather hollow.  In any event, it is odd to 
think that the privacy rights of these third persons do not interfere with Epstein himself 
(a convicted sex offender) reviewing these materials but forbid equal viewing by 
attorneys for a victim who was victimized by him.  In any event, none of the authorities 
cited by Epstein are remotely similar to the case at hand.  Epstein’s argument should 
therefore be rejected summarily.

constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate

Reply to Epstein’s Response: 
 
 
Epstein’s main argument to turning over financial records is that he has 
explained in two sealed documents (doc. #282 and doc. #283) why producing financial 
records would incriminate him.  Of course, because these documents are sealed, Jane 
Doe has no way of determining one way or other whether Epstein’s assertions are true.  
Jane Doe therefore respectfully asks the Court to make its determination of the issue, 
mindful of the fact that it is proceeding without the benefit of an adversarial presentation 
from Jane Doe.  
 
If the Court concludes that the materials in DE 282 and DE 283 do demonstrate 
that Epstein would incriminate himself by discussing his assets – and, in particular, his 
recent transfers of assets to overseas locations and elsewhere – then the Court should 
consider the information in deciding whether to grant Jane Doe’s motion for Preliminary 
Injunction Restraining Fraudulent Transfer of Assets [DE165], for reasons that Jane 
Doe explains in her concurrently-filed Notice that Additional Evidence of Epstein’s 
Fraudulent Asset Transfers Will Be Filed shortly and  Motion for Consideration by the 
Court  of Materials in DE 282 and DE 283 in Determining Motion for Appointment of a 
Receiver. 
 
Epstein’s other generic objections are makeweight and should be rejected.  The 
financial records are relevant to a variety of issues in the case, including Jane Doe’s 
efforts to show a conspiracy and to obtain punitive damages.

Request No. 12:  Personal tax returns for all years from 2002 through the present. 
 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution; overly broad.

Epstein’s refusal to turn over his filed tax returns is absurd.  For all the reasons 
explained earlier in connection with Requests 7, 9 and 10, the government (i.e., the 
IRS) already has a copy of these returns. Therefore, it can hardly be incriminating for 
Epstein to produce them.   
 
There is an additional, independent reason for rejecting Epstein’s refusal to 
produce his tax returns.  Tax records, including in particular filed tax returns, are 
“required records” that are not covered by the Fifth Amendment.  See, e.g., Rajah v. 
Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 442 (2nd Cir. 2008) (“. . . a taxpayer’s W-2 forms are required 
records not subject to the Fifth Amendment because they are a mandatory part of a civil 
regulatory regime . . . . “); In re Doe, 711 F.2d 1187, 1191 (2d Cir. 1983) (“we have little 
difficulty applying the required records exception to the W-2 . . . forms” and ordering 
production of W-2 forms over Fifth Amendment objection);  In re Doe, 97  F.R.D. 640, 
644-45 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (ordering production of physician’s W-2 forms as required

rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 608 n.3 
(1984).  Of course, in all these cases, tax returns were ordered produced even though a 
federal statute (cited by Epstein) makes tax returns “confidential.”  See 26 U.S.C. § 
6103.  In all these cases, the confidentiality of provided by the IRS statute was 
obviously and properly overridden by the discovery procedures found in Fed. R. Civ. P.

six year period would be unduly burdensome and time consuming.5

Here again, Epstein has no good basis for refusing to turn over something that 
the government is aware of and has inspected.  Epstein has had to produce his 
passport to government immigration agents whenever he leaves or enters the United 
States.  There is no valid Fifth Amendment basis for refusing the same opportunity to 
Jane Doe. 
In addition, like income tax records, a passport is a “required record” for which no 
Fifth Amendment privilege is available.  See Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 442 (2nd 
Cir. 2008) (“Just as a taxpayer’s W-2 forms are required records not subject to the Fifth 
Amendment because they are a mandatory part of a civil regulatory regime, so too are 
the passports . . . at issue in the current case”).

5 Jane Doe believes that Epstein used overseas travel as a means of obtaining underage girls for sexual 
purposes and for avoiding criminal prosecution for such activities.  Also, providing a copy of a passport is 
hardly “burdensome.”  Also, given the fact that Epstein is likely to have used the services of a travel agent 
or another intermediary, it should not be difficult for him to provide evidence of his overseas travels from 
such intermediaries.

Reply to Epstein’s Response: 
 
Epstein claims, but does not prove, that he has hired Dr. Stephen Alexander as 
an expert witness in this case.  He contends that he is therefore no obligated to turn 
over Dr. Alexander’s records. 
Jane Doe understands that Dr. Alexander was Epstein’s physician before this 
litigation ever started.  Therefore, as to all records before such hiring, there is no 
protection.  Even after such hiring, it would be Epstein’s burden to show that certain 
medical examinations were done for purposes of litigation to prove work-product 
protection – a burden Epstein has not attempted to meet. 
Epstein also notes that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(“HIPAA”) requires that records be disclosed in civil discovery only under an order 
insuring confidentiality.  Jane Doe has no objection to such a confidentiality order.  
Finally, Epstein argues that some of the records may be protected by the Florida doctor-
patient privilege.  Fla. Stat. § 90.503(2).  Epstein, however, is required to demonstrate 
that the elements of the privilege are satisfied on a document-by-document basis.  
Epstein has failed to do this and the documents should therefore be produced (or, in the 
alternative, Epstein should make an in camera submission showing how each document 
is privileged). 
CONCLUSION 
 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests 
for production discussed above.
