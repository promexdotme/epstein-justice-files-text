MOTION OF DEFENDANT JEFFREY ESPTEIN TO QUASH SERVICE OF PROCESS 
AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves pursuant 
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(S) to quash service of process, and without waiving any available 
jurisdictional defenses and without making a general appearance, states as follows: 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
Plaintiff, M.J ., attempted to effect service on Mr. Epstein by leaving a copy of the Summons 
and Complaint in an unmarked, unaddressed and unpostmarked envelope in a mailbox at Mr. 
Epstein's vacation house at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, at an unknown time between 
October 8, 2010 and October 13, 2010. Such "service" does not comply with the requirements for 
service of process under New York, Florida or federal law. The attempt at service of process was 
ineffective. Service of process should be quashed. 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
The Complaint in this action was filed, and a summons was issued as to Jeffrey 
FOWLER WHITE BURNETT P.A. • EsPIRITO SANTO PLAZA. 1395 BRICKEll AVENUE, 14™ FLOOR, MIAMI, FLORIDA 33131 -3302 • (305) 789-9200

Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WPD 
Epstein, on September 17, 2010. 
2. 
On Wednesday, October 13, 2010, an unmarked, unaddressed and unpostmarked 
envelope was discovered in the mailbox at Mr. Epstein's vacation home at 9 East 71
st Street, New 
York, New York. The envelope contained a Summons and Complaint in the subject action, a Civil 
Rico Case Statement, a deposition subpoena, notices of video depositions, interrogatories and 
requests for production. (Ex. A, Aff. Richard Barnett). 
3. 
Service was never delivered to anyone at Mr. Epstein's vacation home in New York. 
(Id.). 
4. 
On or about October 13, 2010, Plaintiff's counsel, Brad Edwards, Esq. upon leaving 
a hearing in Bankruptcy Court before the Honorable Raymond Ray, advised Christopher Knight, 
Esq., that Plaintiff M.J. had service on Mr. Epstein at his building in New York. That prompted 
undersigned counsel's firm to review the court file in the instant case, which indicated that there was 
no return of service in the court file. As of today, there is a document which purports to be a return 
of service. 
ARGUMENT 
NO SERVICE UNDER FLORIDA, NEW YORK OR FEDERAL LAW 
In this action, three methods of service of process are authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. First, service can be effected pursuant to the procedures "in the state where the district 
court is located" - i.e. Florida. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(l). Second, service can be effected in 
accordance with the procedures "in the state ... where service is made" - i.e. New York. Id. Finally, 
service can be effected pursuant to federal procedures by delivering a copy of the summons and

complaint to the individual personally, leaving a copy of same at the individual's dwelling "with 
someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there" or delivering a copy to an agent authorized 
to accept service of process. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(l). Service was not effected pursuant to any 
of these three methods of service available to Plaintiff. 
No Service Under Florida Law. Under § 48.031(1)(a), Fla. Stat., service "is made by 
delivering a copy of it to the person to be served with a copy of the complaint, petition, or other 
initial pleading or paper or by leaving the copies at his or her usual place of abode with any person 
residing therein who is 15 years of age or older and informing the person of their contents .... " 
Leaving an unmarked envelope with a summon and complaint in a mailbox at a vacation residence 
does not comply with§ 48.031(1)(a), Fla. Stat. 
No Service Under New York Law. Under New York law, personal service may be made inter 
alia on an individual by delivering the summons and complaint to the defendant or "to a person of 
suitable' age and discretion at the actual place of business, dwelling place or usual abode of the 
[defendant]," and by mailing the summons and complaint to the person to be served at his last 
known address by first class mail. N.Y.C.P.L.R. §308(2). (McKinney 2008). Proof of such service 
must be "filed with the clerk of the court designated in the summons within twenty days of either 
such delivery or mailing, whichever is effected later." Id. Neither of these procedures was followed 
in the instant case. Merely leaving an unmarked envelope with a summons and complaint in a 
mailbox does not comply with New York law on service of process. 
No Service under Federal Law. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2), service is effected by 
delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant personally; by leaving a copy of

same at the "individual's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and 
discretion who resides there; or by delivering a copy of same "to an agent authorized by appointment 
or by law to receive service of process." There is no question that service was not effected pursuant 
to any of foregoing provisions of federal law. 
Accordingly, service of process must be quashed because it was completely ineffective under 
Florida, New York and federal law. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully requests that service of process be 
quashed.
