C.L., 
vs. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 10-80447-CIV 
Plaintiff, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
----------~/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR MORE DEFINITE 
STATEMENT & TO STRIKE, & TO DISMISS DIRECTED TO COUNT 
III OF PLAINTIFF C.L.'S COMPLAINT (D.E. 1, dated 3/31/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, files this Motion For More Definite Statement & Strike, and Motion to Dismiss 
Count III Directed To Plaintiff C.L.'s Complaint. Rule 12(b)(6), Rule 12(e) and (f), 
Fed.R.Civ.P. (2010); Local Gen. Rule 7.1 (S.D. Fla. 2009). 
In support of his motion, 
Defendant states: 
The Complaint attempts to allege 3 counts, all of which are purportedly brought 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 - Civil Remedies for Personal Injuries. Defendant seeks 
more definite statement of the precise time period during which the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN involving Plaintiff occurred, and seeks more definite statement as to C.L.'s 
date of birth so he can determine when she was no longer a minor. Plaintiffs complaint 
fails to state even these rudimentary facts. 
As discussed more fully below herein, when 
EPSTEIN's alleged conduct involving C.L. occurred determines what version of 18 
U.S.C. §2255 applies to this action. 
To be clear, Defendant recognizes that pursuant to the NPA (Non-Prosecution 
Agreement) he cannot challenge the standing of Plaintiff to bring an action exclusively 
1 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 2 of 22
under 18 U.S.C. §2255 or raise certain defenses as long as the action is brought 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. §2255. In addition, EPSTEIN pursuant to the NPA does not 
contest this Court's jurisdiction and waives liability as required by paragraph 8 of the 
NPA as to a predicate act or acts under §2255. However, the NPA does not prevent 
Defendant from asserting what version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 applies for purposes of 
establishing a minimum statutory damage recovery and whether one of the three 
specified predicate acts which was enacted subsequent to the completion of the 
defendant's alleged offense conduct with allegedly injured the plaintiff can be applied in 
the face of constitutional ex post facto prohibitions to criminal offenses that were not in 
effect at the time of the conduct at issue. See footnote 1 herein regarding EPSTEIN' s 
obligation to honor the terms of the NP A. 
To the extent that the conduct alleged by Plaintiff occurred prior to July 27, 2006, 
Count III is subject to dismissal because the predicate act relied upon by Plaintiff for her 
claims did not come into effect until July 27, 2006. Defendant's attorneys are 100% 
certain that Plaintiff, in being required to assert basic pleading requirement of time for 
the alleged acts, will allege that the conduct took place prior to July 27, 2006. Defendant 
notes that through his undersigned counsel's review of The Town of Palm Beach Police 
Department file produced in discovery that C.L. was meeting with the police in 
December of2005; that C.L.'s date of birth is April of 1988 (thus 18 and not a minor as 
of the time of the enactment of the predicate offense upon which Count III is based); and 
that she claimed she was at Defendant's home in 2004. By the Court requiring that 
Plaintiff plead such allegations, Plaintiff will detennine that she has no cause of action in 
Count III as a matter of law. While this court obviously has not yet ruled on the Motion 
2 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 3 of 22
for More Definite Statement, Defendant is presenting his argument to Count III knowing 
that Plaintiff can and should concede the missing elements of "time" and birth month and 
year in her response. 
Supporting Memorandum of Law 
Motion For More Definite Statement and To Strike, Rule 12(e) and (f), F.R.C.P. 
Plaintiff alleges that "beginning in or around 1998 through in or around 
September 2007, Defendant used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor 
girls to engage in a systematic pattern of sexually exploitative behavior." (Complaint, 
ill 0). C.L. further alleges that she "originally introduced to Defendant when she was 
fifteen (15) years old." (Id, ill8). There are no allegations in the Complaint as to 
Plaintiffs date of birth or as to the time period during which the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN involving C.L. occurred. Such allegations are critical as it determines what 
version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 applies to this action. As discussed more fully below herein, 
18 U.S.C. was amended, effective July 27, 2006. 
Defendant also seeks to strike and more definitely state ilil8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 
and 15, such that the allegations pertain to C.L. and not other alleged victims or what 
EPSTEIN's alleged conduct was with respect to other alleged victims. Such allegations 
are immaterial and impertinent as they are not related to Plaintiffs C.L.'s claim. Plaintiff 
should allege those facts that specifically pertain to her. Not until ill 6 does Plaintiff 
assert allegations pertaining to her and the conduct of Defendant directly involving her. 
What EPSTEIN may or may not have allegedly done with respect to other females does 
not affect Plaintiffs claim brought pursuant to §2255.

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 4 of 22
The same lawyers that represent Plaintiff C.L. also represent Plaintiff B.B. in 
action filed against EPSTEIN in state court - Case No. 502008CA0373 l 9XXXXMB AB, 
15th Judicial Circuit Court, in for Palm Beach County, State of Florida. It appears that 
Plaintiffs counsel carelessly used the B.B. complaint as a template for this action even 
though different causes of action are asserted therein. At one time, the B.B. action 
attempted to include a Florida RICO claim which has now been voluntarily dismissed; 
Plaintiffs counsel by including allegations as to other Plaintiffs and other alleged "girls" 
was attempting to improperly assert a RICO claim in B.B. 
(Such immaterial and 
impertinent allegations in the B.B. case are also the subject of a motion to strike). 
Reference to a scheme, pattern, and plan are immaterial and impertinent to C.L.'s claim. 
Plaintiff is not allowed to argue other alleged Plaintiffs cases. The C.L. action is brought 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. §2255. The allegations in ,r,r8-15 are not related to the 
elements of Plaintiffs §2255 claim and, thus, are required to be stricken and/or replead to 
more definitely state the alleged facts specific to C.L. 
Motion to Dismiss Count III 
Because EPSTEIN's conduct occurred prior to July 27, 2006, and 
Plaintiff is relying on a statutory predicate act that was not enacted until 
after Jul. 27, 2006, Count III is required to be dismissed. 1 
Plaintiff is relying on a criminal predicate act, 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g) that was not 
even in existence at the time of the alleged conduct by EPSTEIN directed to C.L. which 
would clearly violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As noted above, 
Defendant is certain that when Plaintiff is required to more definitely state her claim and 
1 EPSTEIN will fully honor his obligations as set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United 
States Attorney's Office; principally, as related to the claims made in this case by C.L., the obligations as 
set forth in paragraph 8 of that Agreement. In particular, EPSTEIN will not contest the allegation that he 
committed at least one predicate offense as alleged by C.L. 
4 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 5 of 22
allege facts as to time and conduct/acts specific to her, the date of the acts alleged will be 
prior to July 27, 2006, and thus, Defendant will argue his position based on the fact that 
no alleged conduct by EPSTEIN involving C.L. occurred on or after July 27, 2006. 
Additionally and equally important, as of July 27, 2006, C.L. would be 18 and no longer 
a minor at the time 18 U.S.C. §2255A(g) was enacted. Plaintiff in her response can and 
should concede this issue. 
There is no language in the statute which suggests (g) is to apply retroactively. It 
is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's inquiry begins with the plain and 
unambiguous language of the statutory text. CBS, Inc. v. Prime Time 24 Venture, 245 
F.3d 1217 (11 th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Castroneves, 2009 WL 528251, *3 (S.D. Fla. 2009), 
citing Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F.3d 732, 734 (11 th Cir. 2008); and Smith v. Husband, 376 
F.Supp.2d at 610 ("Wben interpreting a statute, [a court's] inquiry begins with the text."). 
"The Court must first look to the plain meaning of the words, and scrutinize the statute's 
'language, structure, and purpose."' Id. In addition, in construing a statute, a court is to 
presume that the legislature said what it means and means what it said, and not add 
language or give some absurd or strained interpretation. As stated in CBS, Inc., supra at 
1228 "Those who ask courts to give effect to perceived legislative intent by interpreting 
statutory language contrary to its plain and unambiguous meaning are in effect asking 
courts to alter that language, and ' [ c ]ourts have no authority to alter statutory language .... 
We cannot add to the terms of [the] provision what Congress left out.' Merritt, 120 F.3d 
at 1187." See also Dodd v. U.S., 125 S.Ct. 2478 (2005); 73 Am.Jur.2d Statutes §124. 
Title 18 of the U.S.C. is entitled "Crimes and Criminal Procedure." §2255 1s 
contained in "Part I. Crimes, Chap. 110. Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of 
5 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 6 of 22
Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2002)2, is entitled Civil remedy for personal injuries, and 
provides: 
(a) Any minor who is a victim ofa violation of section 224l(c), 2242, 2243, 
2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and 
who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any 
appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual 
damages such minor sustains and the cost of the suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as described in the preceding 
sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than 
$50,000 in value. 
(b) Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the 
complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues or 
in the case of a person under a legal disability, not later than three years 
after the disability. 
See endnote I hereto for statutory text as amended in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. Prior to the 2006 amendments, the version of the statute quoted above was in 
effect beginning in 1999. 1 
The amended version of §2255 significantly changed 
subsection (a) such that it now reads -
(a) In general.--Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a 
violation of section 224l(c). 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 
2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as 
a result of such violation, regardless of whether the injury occurred 
while such person was a minor, may sue in any appropriate United 
States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such person 
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. 
Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to 
have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value. 
(Emphasis added to highlight the changes to the statute effective July 27, 2006). 
In Count III of her Complaint, she alleges that Defendant "knowingly engaged in a 
child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g)(2), in violation of 18 
U.S.C. §2252A(g)(l)." §2252A is one of the specified criminal predicate acts under 18 
2 The above quoted version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 was the same beginning in 1999 until amended in 2006, 
effective July 27, 2006. 
6 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 7 of 22
U.S.C. §2255. However, subsection (g) of §2252 was not added to §2252 until July, 
2006. In attempting to assert a claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff is relying on 
subsection, (g)(l) and (2), of the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. §2252A as the requisite 
predicate act. Subsection (g) of §2252A was enacted in 2006, effective July 27, 2006. 
See 2006 Amendments; Pub.L. 109-248, § 701, added subsec. (g). 18 U.S.C.A. § 2252A. 
If the alleged conduct by EPSTEIN directed to C.L. occurred prior to the effective date of 
the statute, reliance on subsection (g) violates the well entrenched constitutional 
principles against retroactivity, and, thus, Count III is required to be dismissed. If the 
acts occurred only after July 27, 2006 (which Defendant's attorney know cannot be true), 
C.L. would be 18 and not a minor, so the statute would have no application. 
Pre-July, 2006, 18 U.S.C. §2252A contained no subsection (g) as relied on by 
Plaintiff.2 See endnote 2 hereto for complete statutory text of 18 U.S.C. §2252A (2004), 
and as amended effective, July 26, 2006. Subsection (g) which did not exist at the time 
of Defendant's alleged conduct now criminalizes the following conduct-
(g) Child exploitation enterprises.-
( 1) Whoever engages in a child exploitation enterprise shall be fined under this 
title and imprisoned for any term of years not less than 20 or for life. 
(2) A person engages in a child exploitation enterprise for the purposes of this 
section if the person violates section 1591, section 1201 if the victim is a minor, 
or chapter 109A (involving a minor victim), 110 (except for sections 2257 and 
2257 A), or 117 (involving a minor victim), as a part of a series of felony 
violations constituting three or more separate incidents and involving more than 
one victim, and commits those offenses in concert with three or more other 
persons. 
See endnote 2 hereto. 
It is an axiom of law that "retroactivity is not favored in the law." Bowen, 488 U.S., 
at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471 (1988). As eloquently stated in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 
114 S.Ct. 1483, 1497, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994): 
7 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 8 of 22
... the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. 
Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an 
opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; 
settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.FNIS For that reason, the 
"principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed 
under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and 
universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., 
concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial and 
artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence 
about the legal consequences of their actions. 
FN18. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 
1105, 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents 
problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective 
legislation, because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and 
upset settled transactions"); [Further citations omitted]. 
It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds 
expression in several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause 
flatly prohibits retroactive application of penal legislation.FNI 9 Article I, § 
I 0, cl. 1, prohibits States from passing another type of retroactive legislation, 
laws "impairing the Obligation of Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings 
Clause prevents the Legislature (and other govermnent actors) from depriving 
private persons of vested property rights except for a "public use" and upon 
payment of "just compensation." The prohibitions on "Bills of Attainder" in Art. 
I, §§ 9-10, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons and 
meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. 
Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 
(1965). The Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and 
repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification 
sufficient to validate a statute's prospective application under the Clause "may 
not suffice" to warrant its retroactive application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn 
Mining Co., 428 U.S. !, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). 
FN19. Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress 
(§ 9, cl. 3), the other to the States(§ 10, cl. 1). We have construed the Clauses 
as applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-
391, I L.Ed. 648 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). 
These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular 
concerns. The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled 
expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity 
to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive 
legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals. As 
Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for * * 1498 the Court in Weaver v. 
8 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 9 of 22
Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981), the Ex Post Facto 
Clause not only ensures that individuals have "fair warning" about the effect of 
criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by restraining arbitrary 
and potentially vindictive legislation." Id., at 28-29, 101 S.Ct., at 963-964 
( citations omitted). FN20 
FN20. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 513-514, 109 S.Ct. 
706, 732, I 02 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking 
bodies that promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional 
prohibitions against the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder 
reflect a valid concern about the use of the political process to punish or 
characterize past conduct of private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather 
than the legislative process, that is best equipped to identify past wrongdoers 
and to fashion remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would 
have existed had no wrong been committed") (STEVENS, J., concurring in 
part and concurring in judgment); James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213,247, 
n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) (retroactive punitive 
measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally 
but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or classes of 
persons"). 
These well entrenched constitutional protections and presumptions against 
retroactive application of legislation establish that 18 U.S.C. §2252A in effect at the time 
of the alleged conduct apply to the instant action, not the amended version which added 
subsection (g). 
Not only is there no clear express intent stating that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, but even if there were such an intent (which does not exist), applying a 
later version of the statute would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the 
United States Constitution as it would be applied to events occurring before its enactment 
and would increase the penalty or punishment for the alleged crime. U.S. Const. Art. 1, 
§9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1. U.S. v. Seigel, 153 F.3d 1256(11 th Cir. 1998); U.S. v. Edwards, 162 
F.3d 87 (3d Cir. 1998); and generally, Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390, I L.Ed. 648, 1798 
WL 587 (Calder) (1798).

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 10 of 22
The United States Constitution provides that "[n]o Bill of Attainder or ex 
post facto Law shall be passed" by Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3. A law 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it" 'appli[es] to events occurring before 
its enactment ... [and] disadvantage[s] the offender affected by it' by 
altering the definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for 
the crime." Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 
(1997) (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 
17 (1981)). 
U.S. v. Siegel,153 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11 th Cir. 1998). (Empasis added to above 
quotations). 
The statute, as amended in 2006, contains no language stating that the application 
of subsection (g) is to be retroactive. Thus, there is no manifest intent that the statute is 
to apply retroactively, and, accordingly, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged 
conduct is to apply. Landgrafv. USI Film Products, supra, at 1493, ("A statement that a 
statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has 
any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."). Here the statute, by adding 
subsection (g), clearly alters the definition of the criminal conduct. 
The cases of U.S. v. Siegel, supra (11 th Cir. 1998), and U.S. v. Edwards, supra (3d 
Cir. 1998), support Defendant's position that application of the current version of 18 
U.S.C. §2252A would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Siegel, the 
Eleventh Circuit found that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred application of the Mandatory 
Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MYRA) to the defendant whose criminal conduct 
occurred before the effective date of the statute, 18 U.S.C. §3664(f)(l)(A), even though 
the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding occurred after the effective date of the statute. 
On July 19, 1996, the defendant Siegel pleaded guilty to various charges under 18 U.S.C. 
§371 and §1956(a)(l)(A), (conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, and 
laundering of money instruments; and money laundering). He was sentenced on March 
10 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 11 of 22
7, 1997. As part of his sentence, Siegel was ordered to pay $1,207,000.00 in restitution 
under the MYRA which became effective on April 24, 1996. Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 
Stat. 1214, 1229-1236. The 1996 amendments to MYRA required that the district court 
must order restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss without consideration of the 
defendant's ability to pay. Prior to the enactment of the MVRA and under the former 18 
U.S.C. §3664(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), Pub.I. No. 
97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, the court was required to consider, among other factors, the 
defendant's ability to pay in determining the amount of restitution. 
When the MYRA was enacted in 1996, Congress stated that the amendments to the 
VWP A "shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing 
proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment 
of this Act [Apr. 24, 1996]." Siegel, supra at 1258. The alleged crimes occurred between 
February, 1988 to May, 1990. The Court agreed with the defendant's position that 1996 
MVRA "should not be applied in reviewing the validity of the court's restitution order 
because to do so would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States 
Constitution. See U.S. Const. art I, §9, cl. 3." 
In resolving the issue in favor of the defendant, the Court first considered whether 
a restitution order is a punishment. Id, at 1259. In determining that restitution was a 
punishment, the Court noted that §3663A(a)(l) of Title 18 expressly describes restitution 
as a "penalty." In addition, the Court also noted that "[a]lthough not in the context of an 
ex post facto determination, . . . restitution is a 'criminal penalty meant to have strong 
deterrent and rehabilitative effect.' United States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 1493 n. 12 
(11th Cir.1997)." Second, the Court considered "whether the imposition of restitution 
11 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 12 of 22
under the MYRA is an increased penalty as prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause." Id, 
at 1259. In determining that the application of the 1996 MYRA would indeed run afoul 
of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court agreed with the majority of the 
Circuits that restitution under the 1996 MYRA was an increased penalty.3 "The effect of 
the MYRA can be detrimental to a defendant. Previously, after considering the 
defendant's financial condition, the court had the discretion to order restitution in an 
amount less than the loss sustained by the victim. Under the MYRA, however, the court 
must order restitution to each victim in the full amount." Id, at 1260. See also U.S. v. 
Edwards, 162 F.2d 87 (3rd Circuit 1998). 
Based on these principles barring retroactive application, Defendant is entitled to 
a determination that the statute in effect at the time of the alleged criminal conduct 
applies and, thus, Count III is subject to dismissal. The statute now criminalizes conduct 
not previously so criminalized. 
As further explained by the Landgraf court, supra at 280, and at 1505,4 
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the 
court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the 
statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to 
resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such 
express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have 
retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he 
acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with 
respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate 
3 The Eleventh Circuit, in holding that "the MYRA cannot be applied to a person whose criminal conduct 
occurred prior to April 24, 1996," was "persuaded by the majority of districts on this issue." "Restitution is 
a criminal penalty carrying with it characteristics of criminal punishment." Siegel, supra at 1260. The 
Eleventh Circuit is in agreement with the Second, Third, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits. See U.S. v. 
Futrell, 209 F.3d 1286, 1289-90 (ll"' Cir. 2000). 
4 In Landgraf, the United States Supreme Court affinned the judgment of the Court of Appeals 
and refused to apply new provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to conduct occurring before 
the effective date of the Act. The Court determined that statutory text in question, § I 02, was 
subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity. 
12 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/03/2010   Page 13 of 22
retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent 
clear congressional intent favoring such a result. 
Even though C.L. has invoked the provisions of the criminal NP A between 
EPSTEIN and USAO (see paragraphs 27 and 28 of Complaint), it does not mean that 
Plaintiff can avoid application of the well established constitutional protections discussed 
herein (as well as other constitutional protections and principles, including but not limited 
to the rule of lenity and due process) and which EPSTEIN is entitled to assert so long as 
the assertions do not conflict with his obligations to neither contest jurisdiction nor 
liability as set forth in paragraph 8 of the NP A. 
Thus, Count III should be dismissed to the extent it relies on conduct that occurred 
prior to July 27, 2006, and relies on a criminal predicate act that did not come into 
existence until July 27, 2006, in violation of the constitutional prohibitions of 
retroacti vity. 
Conclusion 
Pursuant to the above, Count III is required to be dismissed. In addition, Plaintiff 
should be required to more definitely state the specific dates of the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN specifically involving her, and her date of birth. Any conduct occurring after 
her 18th birthday should be stricken, and ,r,rs - 15 of the Complaint should also be 
stricken and be replead to the extent that allegations specifically involve C.L. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Count III against him, 
and further grant his Motion for More Definite Statement and to Strike.
