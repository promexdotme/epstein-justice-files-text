INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein" or "Defendant"), by and 
through his undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Response In Opposition to 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe #102's Motion to Proceed Anonymously and files his Motion 
requesting that this Court enter an order identifying in the style of this case the 
complete legal name of the Plaintiff, JANE DOE #102 ("JANE DOE"), to 
substitute her complete legal name in this case in place of "JANE DOE" and, 
equally important, allowing Defendant to identify her in various subpoenas that 
Epstein must serve so Epstein can defend this case. In support, Mr. Epstein 
states as follows:

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 2 of 12
I. Response In Opposition With Incorporated Motion And Incorporated 
Memorandum Of Law 
a. 
Background 
1. 
On May 1, 2009, Plaintiff filed this action against Epstein. The 
Complaint (DE 1) alleges three causes of action against him: Count I - Coercion 
and Enticement of a Minor to Engage in Prostitution or Sexual Activity Pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2422(b); Count II - Cause of Action for Transportation 
With Intent to Engage in Illicit Sexual Conduct Pursuant to Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§§2255 and 2423(a); Count Ill - Cause of Action for Travel with Intent to Engage 
In Illicit Sexual Conduct Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2423(b); Count IV -
Coercion and Enticement of a Minor to Engage in Prostitution or Sexual Activity 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2422(a); Count V - Cause of Action for 
Transportation with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity Pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §§2255 and 2421; Count VI - Cause of Action for Sexual Exploitation of 
Children Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2255; Count VII - Cause of Action 
for Transport of Visual Depiction of Minor Engaging in Sexually Explicit Conduct 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2252(a)(1)); Count VIII - Cause of Action for 
Transport of Child Pornography Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2252A(a)(1)); 
2. 
Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that she is entitled to money 
damages pursuant to 2255 (in the wherefore clause), as well as actual and 
compensatory. 
3. 
Obviously, Plaintiff alleges separate counts against Mr. Epstein, on 
which he must conduct discovery to defend this case. Therefore, for the reasons 
set forth herein, not only must JANE DOE'S Motion to Proceed Anonymously be 
2 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 3 of 12
denied, but Epstein's Motion to Identify Jane Doe must be granted. 
Despite 
Plaintiff's allegations in the Motion to Proceed Anonymously, this Court has not 
"allowed" any Plaintiff to proceed anonymously. Quite simply, that is the way 
each Plaintiff chose to file each of their respective cases, all of which are 
currently being challenged in those other matters by Motion to Identify. 
4. 
Importantly, JANE DOE claims that she has and will suffer " . 
. physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss 
of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her 
privacy, separation from her family 
. . . , and medical and psychological 
expenses ... , loss on income, loss of the capacity to earn income in the future, 
and loss of the capacity to enjoy life" 111128, Comp .. DE 1; see also 111136, 40, 44, 
48, 52, 56, 61, 65, and 69, Comp., DE 1. 
5. 
Epstein has a constitutional due process right to defend himself and 
to seek the production of information that will assist in his defense of the 
allegations in the Complaint. In this case, Plaintiff's counsel intends on serving 
subpoenas on Plaintiffs treating physicians and other third parties. Thus, this 
motion seeks not only a denial Plaintiff's Motion to Proceed Anonymously but to 
identify JANE DOE in the style of this case and to identify JANE DOE in various 
third-party subpoenas for discovery purposes. 
6. 
The undersigned's experience in "Jane Doe" lawsuits is that once a 
Plaintiff is identified, other individuals come forward in the discovery phase with 
information which often directly contradicts allegations as to the events and 
3 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 4 of 12
damages. For instance, witnesses may testify that Plaintiff was paid by others 
for similar sexual acts she claims Mr. Epstein forced upon her or that she willingly 
participated in certain act(s) that would negate or lessen her damages. This goes 
directly to Plaintiff's damage claim. 
7. 
Likewise, subpoenas must be issued to third-party treaters and 
current and former employers, and those subpoenas will seek to obtain records 
related directly to Plaintiff's claims and her damages (i.e., her claim for severe 
and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and emotional 
damages and loss of self-esteem as referenced above). 
Cherenfant v. 
Nationwide Credit. Inc., 2004 WL 5315889 (S.D. Fla. 2004)(order allowing 
discovery of medical records consistent with Plaintiff's allegations in complaint). 
This too goes directly to Plaintiff's damage claims. Medical providers, employers, 
co-employees, etc... have direct and relevant personal knowledge and 
observations regarding damages, i.e., emotional state, activities, self-esteem, 
etc .... 
8. 
Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 26 allows for broad discovery. 
Epstein is not 
required to rely solely on Plaintiff's discovery responses in defending this case, 
nor is Epstein required by any statute or law to rely only upon what Plaintiff may 
produce in discovery or may obtain from her own medical treaters through her 
counsel, and to then provide to Epstein only after Plaintiff has reviewed same. In 
certain related state court actions involving Epstein, the undersigned offered to 
serve certain subpoenas on the medical treaters and other third-parties with full 
name, date of birth and Plaintiff's social security number (last four digits), but 
4 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 5 of 12
agreed that the subpoenas filed with the clerk would be redacted. 
Several 
attorneys agreed to this procedure in those cases. In Federal Court, subpoenas 
are not filed with the clerk. Thus, in this matter, the undersigned offered to serve 
the third-party subpoenas with plaintiff's full name, date of birth and social 
security number (last four digits) and would 
agree to redact any identifying 
information on any documents filed with this court if that ultimately became 
necessary. 
9. 
Moreover, when an order from the court is attached to the 
Subpoena, treaters and other third parties produce the records and show up to 
the depositions with the records requested because the deponent knows what to 
bring by virtue of knowing the identity of the Plaintiff. 
10. 
Epstein's counsel intends to serve and depose witnesses duces 
tecum. If Epstein is not permitted to identify JANE DOE (thus allowing her to 
proceed anonymously), how will any deponent know who the parties are and 
what to bring to the deposition pursuant to the duces tecum? Further, how will 
Epstein be able to defend the claims. Just like the Plaintiff, Epstein is entitled to 
due process. 
If the Court allows Jane Doe to proceed anonymously, Jane Doe 
will be permitted to present her case and Epstein will be limited in his defenses. 
11. 
While it is within the sound discretion of this court to allow a party to 
proceed anonymously, Plaintiff should not attempt to utilize that discretion as a 
shield from legitimate and necessary discovery. Epstein has a fundamental due 
process right to conduct discovery. 
5 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 6 of 12
b. Response In Opposition And Motion To Identify JANE DOE In Style 
Of This Case 
12. 
As discussed below, Epstein has fundamental due process right to 
defend himself in this civil litigation. 
While JANE DOE travels under a 
pseudonym, various newspaper articles identifying Epstein have been released 
discussing the alleged claims against him. Allowing JANE DOE to litigate this 
matter under a pseudonym is preventing Epstein from defending this suit 
including, but not limited to, preventing him from locating individuals that may 
have information about this lawsuit and information about JANE DOE that may 
discredit her allegations and/or lessen the monetary damages she seeks to 
recover. It is the undersigned's experience that once identified, witnesses begin 
to come forward. See supra. 
13. 
In Doe v. Lepley, 185 F.R.D. 605 (D. Ct. NV 1999), a sexual 
harassment case, the court reasoned that there is no express or implied right to 
bring an action anonymously. 
Id. at 606. 
Moreover, Fed. R. Civ. P 10(a) 
requires that the complaint include the names of the parties. )Q. When Plaintiffs 
are permitted to proceed anonymously, the court must employ a balancing test to 
decide if the plaintiff has a substantial privacy interest that outweighs the 
presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. Id., citing, Doe v. Frank, 951 
F.2d 320, 323 (11 th Cir. 1992)(requiring complaint to include the names of the 
parties serves more than administrative convenience, it protects the public's 
legitimate interests in knowing all the facts involved, including the identity of the 
parties - thus denying request to proceed anonymously). The factors include: 
a. 
whether the plaintiff is challenging governmental activity; 
6 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 7 of 12
b. 
whether the party defending the suit would be prejudiced; 
c. 
whether the plaintiff is required to disclose information of 
utmost intimacy; 
d. 
whether the plaintiff is compelled to admit an intention to 
engage 
in 
illegal 
conduct, 
thereby 
risking 
criminal 
prosecution; 
e. 
whether the Plaintiff would risk suffering injury if identified; 
f. 
whether the interests of children are at stake; and 
g. 
whether there are less drastic means of protecting the 
legitimate interests of either party. 
Doe v. Frank, 951 F.2d at 323. 
Plaintiff does not fall under any of the factors. Moreover, even if she did 
meet one of the factors, "[t]he fact that [a] Doe [Plaintiff] may suffer some 
personal embarrassment, standing alone, does not require the granting of a 
request to proceed under a pseudonym." Id; see also Doe v. Rostker, 89 F.R.D. 
159 (N.D. Calif. 1981). 
Any substantial privacy interests JANE DOE has must 
outweigh the customary and constitutionally embedded presumption of openness 
to judicial proceedings. Doe v. Frank, 951 F.2d at 323; Doe v. Bergstron, 2009 
WL 528623 (C.A.9(Or.))(denying request to proceed anonymously in civil action 
by Plaintiff where Plaintiff's arrest, prosecution and acquittal were matters of 
public record). 
14. 
In Sweetland v. State, 535 So.2d 646 (Fla. 1st DCA 1988), the court 
reasoned that the purpose of discovery is to eliminate the likelihood of surprise 
and to insure a fair opportunity to prepare for trial. Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 
1.280(b)(1); see also Surf Drugs. Inc .. v. Vermette, 236 So.2d 108, 111 (Fla. 
7 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 8 of 12
1970)(stating that the rules of discovery should be afforded broad and liberal 
treatment to effectuate their purpose), citing, Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 
501, 507 (1947). 
15. 
Next, the right to go to court to resolve disputes is a fundamental right. 
D.R. Lakes, Inc. v. Brandsmart U.S.A. of West Palm Beach, 819 So.2d 971 (Fla. 4th 
DCA 2002). All litigants are afforded an equal opportunity. Lingle v. Dion, 776 
So.2d 1073 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). The Florida Constitution establishes the right 
commonly known as access to courts. 
Mitchell v. Moore, 786 So.2d 521 (Fla. 
2001 ). Courts shall be open to any person for the redress of any injury and justice 
shall be administered without sale, denial or delay. Art. I, §21, Fla. Const.; 10A Fla. 
Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law, §360. 
16. 
If Jane Doe's name is not disclosed and identified, Mr. Epstein will not 
be afforded his fundamental right to fairly litigate this dispute and prepare for trial. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests that JANE DOE be identified by her legal name in the 
pleadings. 
c. Response In Opposition And Motion To Identify JANE DOE In Third-
Party Subpoenas 
17. 
Epstein will be effectively denied his due process rights to conduct 
broad, open and liberal discovery in that by failing to identify Jane Doe in various 
third-party subpoenas to her medical providers and other third parties, Epstein 
will be prevented from defending this case. 
18. 
The undersigned must serve subpoenas on medical doctors to 
obtain medical information on JANE DOE's alleged psychological and physical 
damages as same goes to the heart of Epstein's defenses and Plaintiff's 
8 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 9 of 12
damages. Plaintiff is claiming emotional/psychological damages. 
Therefore, 
Epstein is entitled to know her psychological condition(s) before and after the 
alleged incident(s) she references in the Complaint. In particular, JANE DOE 
alleges specific disorders as a result of Epstein's alleged conduct - suffer " .. 
. physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss 
of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her 
privacy, separation from her family 
. . . , and medical and psychological 
expenses ... , loss on income, loss of the capacity to earn income in the future, 
and loss of the capacity to enjoy life." (Emphasis Added). See supra. Epstein is 
also entitled to know, among other things, whether she had any physical 
complaints or whether there was ever any evidence of physical battery on JANE 
DOE's body from the acts she complains of in the Complaint. The need to serve 
third-party subpoenas on medical doctors is a basic discovery need related to the 
claims alleged by JANE DOE for which Plaintiff's counsel refuses to compromise. 
Balas v. Ruzzo, 703 So.2d 1076 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997), rev. denied, 719 So.2d 286 
(Fla. 1998)(discoverability of Plaintiff's history of sexual activity is relevant to 
damages); United States v. Bear Stops, 997 F.2d 451 (8th Cir. 1993)(deals with 
"admissibility of other acts of sexual abuse by individuals other than the 
defendant to explain why a victim of abuse exhibited behavioral manifestations of 
a sexually abused child.") 
If Plaintiff saw a psychologist or other physician 
during or after the time periods she claims she was assaulted by Epstein but 
either did not discuss or did discuss the incidents (or lack thereof) would be 
9 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 10 of 12
directly relevant to her damage claims. 
Plaintiff seeks physical and 
emotional/mental personal injury type damages, and the Epstein must conduct 
his own discovery thereon. 
See supra. 
No valid discovery objections or 
exemptions exist preventing necessary and reasonable discovery. 
To hold 
otherwise prevents Mr. Epstein from preparing and defending this matter. 
19. 
In defending this lawsuit, Mr. Epstein should be permitted broad 
discovery, whether admissible at trial or not. 
Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 26 provides, in 
pertinent part, that "parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not 
privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action." 
20. 
In addition, subpoenas must also be served upon various local and 
state institutions in order to determine what crimes, if any, JANE DOE has 
committed (i.e., crimes that involve dishonesty and/or false statement). 
Obviously, this goes directly to the heart of JANE DOE's damages she claims 
suffer suffer ". . .physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, 
psychological and psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, 
embarrassment, loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of 
dignity, invasion of her privacy, separation from her family ... , and medical and 
psychological expenses ... , loss on income, loss of the capacity to earn income 
in the future, and loss of the capacity to enjoy life" - caused by Epstein or other 
events in her life) for which a jury is entitled to hear about at trial, and certified 
records must be obtained from the clerk should JANE DOE answer certain 
questions regarding her crimes incorrectly. 
21. 
Epstein is entitled to know whether Jane Doe committed and/or 
10 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 11 of 12
was charged with any crimes. If Jane Doe was charged with crimes, Epstein is 
entitled to obtain certified copies of those crimes Plaintiff may have committed for 
purposes of discovery and impeachment. Questions will be asked regarding 
those crimes (e.g., Have you been convicted of a crime of dishonesty or false 
statement? If so, how many times? Have you been convicted of a felony? If so, 
how many times?) To hold otherwise would not only prevent broad discovery but 
would ultimately result in reversible error at any trial. 
II. Conclusion and Prayer for Relief 
22. 
Epstein requests the following relief: 
a. 
That JANE DOE's Motion to Proceed Anonymously be denied; 
b. 
That this Court grant Epstein's Motion and that JANE DOE be 
identified by her legal name in the style of this case; and 
c. 
That Epstein be granted leave to identify JANE DOE by her 
legal name in Third-Party Subpoenas (but not file them in Court 
or, if required, in a redacted form). 
WHEREFORE, Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein, respectfully requests that this 
Court enter said order granting the relief requested above, and for such other 
and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.
