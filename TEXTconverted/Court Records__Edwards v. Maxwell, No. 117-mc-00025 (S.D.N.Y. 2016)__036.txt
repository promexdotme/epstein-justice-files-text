INTRODUCTION 
Almost one year after being served with a subpoena to produce documents in this matter 
Mr. Edwards, for the first time, claims, with no real legal support, that the letters he sent to 
various former employees of Jeffrey Epstein and other potential witnesses are “work product”.  
Mr. Edwards attempts to obfuscate the issue by claiming that he would have to review hundreds, 
no, thousands, of emails to determine to whom such solicitations were sent.  Mr. Edwards knows 
that he sent a form solicitation letter to many individuals, including former Epstein employees, 
requesting their assistance as a witness in this case.  It strains credibility to believe that Mr. 
Edwards did not keep files related to these people.  It also strains credibility to believe that it 
would take more than a simple word search to find these letters in Mr. Edwards’s files.  Mr. 
Edwards, who has had the subpoena for almost one year, has produced no privilege log 
supporting his assertion of “work product” and fails to address, at all, how the responses of the 
individuals who received the solicitation letters could possibly be his work product.   
I. 
MR. EDWARDS HAS WAIVED ANY CLAIM OF WORK PRODUCT BY HIS 
FAILURE TO PRODUCE A PRIVILEGE LOG. 
It is noteworthy that the initial objection by Mr. Edwards to RFP 19 and RFP 20 was that 
production would be a “burden” on Mr. Edwards. (Mot. To Quash, filed June 16, 2016, at page 
19.)  Now, almost one year later, Mr. Edwards claims that the solicitation letters are “work 
product.”  He has not, however, complied with Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(E)(2)(A). Although Mr. 
Edwards may be allowed to belatedly assert that privilege under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(E)(2)(A), he 
also is required to produce a log of all documents withheld based on any alleged privilege or 
protection: 
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim 
that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must: 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 2 of 7

(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible 
things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will 
enable the parties to assess the claim. 
An “unjustified failure to list privileged documents on the required log of withheld 
documents in a timely and proper manner operates as a waiver of any applicable privilege,” 
OneBeacon Ins. Co. v. Forman Int'l Ltd., 04 CIV. 2271(RWS), 2006 WL 3771010, at *7–8 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2006).  As this Court noted in OneBeacon Ins. Co., the waiver of privilege is 
equally applicable where there is a failure to produce a privilege log under Rules 45 and 26.  Id. 
(citing In re Application for Subpoena to Kroll, 224 F.R.D. 326, 328 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Rule 
45 requires that the party claiming a privilege prepare a privilege log.... Failure to submit a 
privilege log may be deemed a waiver of the underlying privilege claim.”)); Labatt Ltd. v. 
Molson Breweries, Nos. 93 CV 75004, 94 CV 71540(RPP), 1995 WL 23603 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 
1995), aff'd, Dorf & Stanton Commc'ns, Inc., 100 F.3d 919, 923 (Fed.Cir.1997) (upholding 
determination that privilege had been waived due to failure to satisfy Rules 45(d)(2) and 
26(b)(5)); see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 575-76 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that 
a “party that fails to submit a privilege log” pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2) “is deemed to 
waive the underlying privilege claim”).   
II. 
MR. EDWARDS HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE 
SOLICITATION LETTERS ARE WORK PRODUCT AND THAT ANY 
PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THE WORK PRODUCT DOCTRINE HAS NOT 
BEEN WAIVED. 
The party seeking to assert a claim of privilege has the burden of demonstrating both that 
the privilege exists and that it has not been waived. See von Bulow v. von Bulow, 811 F.2d 136, 
144 (2d Cir.1987); Smith v. Conway Org., 154 F.R.D. 73, 77 (S.D.N.Y.1994); Nikkal Indus., Ltd. 
v. Salton, Inc., 689 F. Supp. 187, 191 (S.D.N.Y.1988). This burden stems from the recognition 
that “enforcement of a claim of privilege acts in derogation of the overriding goals of liberal 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 3 of 7

discovery and adjudication on their merits.” Bowne of New York City, Inc. v. AmBase Corp., 150 
F.R.D. 465, 473 (S.D.N.Y.1993). It is for this reason that privileges are “disfavored and 
generally to be narrowly construed.” Id.; see, e.g., United States v. Goldberger & Dubin, 
P.C., 935 F.2d 501, 504 (2d Cir.1991). 
The work product doctrine, codified at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), shields 
from discovery “documents and tangible things ... prepared in anticipation of litigation.” Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 26(b)(3). It “is intended to preserve a zone of privacy in which a lawyer can prepare and 
develop legal theories and strategy ‘with an eye toward litigation,’ free from unnecessary 
intrusion by his adversaries.” United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1196 (2d 
Cir.1998) (quoting Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510–11 (1947)). 
Work product protection “is not absolute. Like other qualified privileges, it may be 
waived.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 239 (1975). The party asserting the protection 
afforded by the work product doctrine has the burden of showing both that the protection exists 
and that it has not been waived. See e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 200 
F.R.D. 183, 188 (W.D.N.Y.2001) (citation omitted); Granite Partners v. Bear, Stearns & Co. 
Inc., 184 F.R.D. 49, 52 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (citing cases).  As the court held in Bristol–Myers 
Squibb Co. v. Rhone–Poulenc Rorer, No. 95 Civ. 8833, 1997 WL 801454, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 
31, 1997), waiver, “of either the lawyer-client or work product privilege, is designed to assure 
fairness to litigants.”  
The solicitation letters at issue here are not work product.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine 
how the type of form letter sent to former Epstein employees could be “work product”.  Mr. 
Edwards, in these form letters, is essentially attempting to “guilt” witnesses into contacting him.  
The factual assertions, or other promises, made by Edwards are certainly not confidential, as they 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 4 of 7

are being directed at persons outside the litigation.  Mr. Edwards has no expectation of privacy or 
confidentiality when he is sending these letters.  To the extent that the purported facts in the 
letters are inaccurate or misrepresented they may be part of any witnesses’ bias or motive to 
testify.  If the witness testifies, the witness can be asked if the witness received a solicitation 
letter from Mr. Edwards, which would not be protected from disclosure.  The proffering of the 
witness acts as a waiver of any work product protection under these circumstances because it 
would be fundamentally unfair to have influenced the witnesses’ testimony but shield the 
influence by a claim of work product. Mr. Edwards has not produced an example of the form 
letter for the Court to review, likely because he knows that the Court would reject the claim that 
the form solicitation letter is work product. 
III. 
MR. EDWARDS HAS NO CLAIM THAT RESPONSES TO THE SOLICITATION 
LETTERS ARE WORK PRODUCT. 
RFP 20 requests the responses to any of the solicitation letters.  Mr. Edwards has no 
claim that what a prospective witness writes back to him is “work product”.  The RFP does not 
ask for Mr. Edwards’s notes or interview memoranda.  It requests whatever response Mr. 
Edwards received from the solicitation.  Mr. Edwards has failed to log any of these 
communications, a waiver in and of itself.  Again, it is likely that he has refused to produce a log 
because to do so would demonstrate the frivolousness of this claim. 
CONCLUSION 
For the above stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Motion to Quash 
be denied.
