FROM: Aileen Josephs, Esq. 
RE: Freedom of Information Request 
Jeffrey Epstein Case 
Case Number 2005CF009454A 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
Enclosed please find a copy of the Freedom of Information that was sent on 
August 14, 2006 to the Public Information Department of the State Attorney's Office and 
pending there ever since. 
I understand that at the moment the file cannot be released because it is still an 
"active investigation", yet all notices related to bearings on this case, or the dates, 
time and place of the hearings for this case are public record, even if the decision to 
postpone, cancel or change is done "orally" I was informed that the file in your office has 
no record of this request to change the date of the scheduled plea conference of January 
4, 2008. The Freedom of Information Act was created to ensure transparency from our 
government officials and prevent sub rosa dealings. 
I respectfully request that I be infonned of the the hearing dates related to this 
case. If the hearing date is changed "orally" I respectfully request pursuant to this FOIA 
that I still be contacted. It is imperative to ensure the trust that we have in your office 
that hearings are public and that the public be given due notice of them, particularly when 
a citizen pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act makes such a request. 
Thank you.

RE: Freedom of Information Request 
Jeffrey Epstein Case 
Case Number 2005CF009454A 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
Enclosed please find a copy of the Freedom of Information that was sent on 
August 14, 2006 to the Public Information Department of the State Attorney's Office and 
pending there ever since. 
I understand that at the moment the file cannot be released because it is still an 
"active investigation", yet all notices related to hearings on this case, or the dates, 
time and place of the hearings for this case are public record, even if the decision to 
postpone, cancel or change is done "orally" I was informed that the file in your office has 
no record of this request to change the date of the scheduled plea conference of January 
4, 2008. The Freedom of Information Act was created to ensure transparency from our 
government officials and prevent sub rosa dealings. 
I respectfully request that I be informed of the the hearing dates related to this 
case. If the hearing date is changed "orally" I respectfully request pursuant to this FOIA 
that I still be contacted. It is imperative to ensure the trust that we have in your office 
that bearings are public and that the public be given due notice of them, particularly when 
a citizen pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act makes such a request. 
Thank you.

RE: Mr. Epstein 
FROM: Aileen Josephs, Esq. 
Mr. Lewis: 
Women in our County have been watching this case with great concern. I 
strongly suggest you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel that your client has been 
defamed, as you mentioned in the February 7, 2008 Pabn Beach Post article, you can file 
a libel suit- of course, the truth is an absolute defense to libel and please keep in mind 
that not knowing the age of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime 
committed against a child.

marijuana rolled in brown paper. I then asked the remainder of the 
occupants separately if they had marijuana and a female, identified as 
nformed me that she did have marijuana, handing me 
from her pocketbook a clear plastic bag containing a quantity of 
marijuana, a brown paper bag containing a quantity of marijuana and a 
glass pipe containing marijuana residue. A search of the vehicle

marijuana from under the front seat. Both individuals were charged 
with possession of marijuana under 20 grams and possession of drug 
paraphernalia and issued NTA's, returnable to Criminal Court, 3238 Gun 
Club Rd., on 9/27/05 at 0800 hours without incident. The marijuana

rough times 
Current mood: Q sad 
Everything sucks right now. 
My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come 
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) 
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying 
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already 
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see 
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or 
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank 
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being 
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been 
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally 
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. 
There's been so much death around me. It's really 
overwhelming.

Freedom!!! 
Current mood: drained 
Hey, 
Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! 
For all of you who are not aware, I moved to 
Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will 
and I are getting along. Not like everyone 
predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of 
that time together will be horrible,...." the complete 
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get 
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" 
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. 
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a 
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an 
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a 
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores 
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I 
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. 
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I 
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it. 
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview 
the day he came in with the application, I think that's 
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right 
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a 
lir while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so 
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS 
job and the lady called me back and told me that 
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence 
that she didn't need to call anyone else back, 	
he 
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound 
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the old 
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No 
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke 
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply 
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back 
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

Biker Bitch 
Current mood: exhausted 
Category: Automotive 
I am s00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys 
For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I 
went with him. It was s00000000000 cool! There was 
400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this 
guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to 
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I 
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He 
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote 
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into 
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and 
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
it!!!!!!!!!!!!IIIIIIIIIIIII  I donated a football and a 
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so 
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. 
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. 
Bye!

BUMMER MAN 
Current mood: Q crushed 
Category: School, College, Greek 
I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for 
on Jan. 5. I'm 
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making 
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so 
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't 
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I 
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to 
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u 
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal 
with it.

Current mood: pissed off 
I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at 
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me 
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the 
way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on 
EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I 
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and 
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN.  IT TO THE MAN! I 
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much 
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more 
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is 
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES''!!!!

hey, 
halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up 
going to a party. our makeup was awesome. i only 
have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have 
more. the one i have up is of us after the make-up 
had been on for hours, 	
it started to peel off in the 
pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found 
a red pitbull puppy a few days ago. i wrote a bulletin 
about her but i forgot to add that she is s000000 
good with children. i have an 18 month old living 
with me and she is just s0000 nice to him. she loves 
to play with him and has not shown one sign of 
agression. even with another dog that is bigger than 
her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i 
want to keep her s0000 bad, i just can't tho. 
someone please take her!!!!!! and provide her with a 
good home!!!!l thank u. <3___.
