STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant was an adult male spanning the ages of 45 and 55 
years old. Defendant is known as a billionaire financier and money manager with a secret 
clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power, and 
influence. He owns a fleet of aircraft that includes a Gulfstream IV, a he1.icopter, and a Boeing 
727, as well as a fleet of motor vehicles. Until his incarceration pursuant to the plea entered and 
sentencing, which occurred on June 30, 2008, he maintained his principal place of residence in 
the largest dwelling in Manhattan, a 51,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on the Upper East 
Side. He also owns a $6.8 million mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a $30 million 7 ,500-acre 
ranch in New Mexico he named "Zorro," a 70-acre private island known as Little St. James in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, a mansion in London's Westminster neighborhood, and another 
residence in the Avenue Foch area of Paris. The allegations herein concern Defendant's conduct 
while at his lavish residence in Palm Beach and numerous other locations both nationally and 
internationally. 
9. 
Defendant has a sexual preference for underage minor girls. He engaged in a 
plan, scheme, or enterprise in which he gained access to countless vulnerable and relatively 
economically disadvantaged minor girls, and sexually assaulted, molested, and/or exploited these 
girls, and then gave them money.

10. 
Beginning in or around 1998 through in or around September 2007, Defendant 
used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor girls to engage in a systematic pattern 
of sexually exploitative behavior. 
11. 
Defendant's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. 
Defendant coerced and enticed impressionable, vulnerable, and relatively economically less 
fortunate minor girls to participate in various acts of sexual misconduct that he committed upon 
them. Defendant's scheme involved the use of underage girls, as well as other individuals, to 
recruit underage girls. Defendant and/or an authorized agent would call and alert Defendant's 
assistants shortly before or after he arrived at his Palm Beach residence. His assistants would 
call economically disadvantaged and underage girls from West Palm Beach and surrounding 
areas who would be enticed by the money being offered and who Defendant and/or his assistants 
perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility issues if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. The then minor Plaintiff and other minor girls, some as young as 
14 years old, were transported to Defendant's Palm Beach mansion by Defondant's employees, 
agents, and/or assistants in order to provide Defendant with "massages." 
12. 
Many of the instances of illegal sexual conduct committed by Defendant were 
perpetrated with the assistance, support, and facilitation of at least three assistants who helped 
him orchestrate this child exploitation enterprise. These assistants would arrange times for 
underage girls to come to Defendant's residence, transport or cause the transportation of 
underage girls to Defendant's residence, escmi the underage girls to the massage room where 
Defendant would be waiting or would enter shortly thereafter, urge the underage girls to remove 
their clothes, deliver cash from Defendant to the underage girls and/or their procurers at the 
conclusion of each "massage appointment," and assist Defendant in taking nude photographs

and/or videos of the underage girls with and/or without their knowledge. Defendant would pay 
the procurer of each girl's "appointment" hundreds of dollars. 
13. 
Defendant designed this scheme to secure a private place in Defendant's Palm 
Beach mansion where only persons employed and invited by Defendant would be present, so as 
to reduce the chance of detection of Defendant's sexual abuse and/or exploitation, as well as to 
make it more difficult for the minor girls to flee the premises and/or to credibly report his actions 
to law enforcement or other authorities. The girls were usually transported by his employee(s), 
agent(s), and/or assistant(s) and/or by taxicab(s) and/or motor vehicle(s) paid for by Defendant, 
which also made it difficult for the girls to flee his mansion. 
14. 
Upon her initial arrival at Defendant's Palm Beach mans10n, each underage 
victim would generally be introduced to one of Defendant's assistants, who would gather the 
girl's personal contact information. The minor girl would be led up a remote flight of stairs to a 
room that contained a massage table and a large shower. 
15. 
At times, if it was the girl's first "massage" appointment, another female would 
be in the room to "lead the way." Generally the other female would leave, or Defendant would 
dismiss her. Often, Defendant would start his massage wearing only a small towel, which 
eventually would be removed. Defendant and/or the other female would direct the girl to 
massage him, giving the minor girl specific instructions as to where and how he wanted to be 
touched, and then direct her to remove her clothing. Defendant would then perform one or more 
lewd, lascivious, and sexual acts, including masturbation; fondling the minor's breasts and/or 
sexual organs; touching the minor's vulva, vagina, and/or anus with a vibrator, back massager, 
his finger(s), and/or his penis; digitally penetrating her vagina; performing intercourse, oral sex, 
and/or anal sex; and/or coercing or attempting to coerce the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or

prostitution and/or enticing the then minor girl to engage in sexual acts with another female in 
Defendant's presence. The exact degree of molestation and frequency with which the sexual 
exploitations took place varied and is not yet completely known; however, Defendant committed 
such acts regularly on a daily basis and, in most instances, several times a day. In order to 
facilitate the daily exchanges of money for sexual assault and abuse, Defendant kept U.S. 
currency readily available. 
16. 
Defendant traveled out of Florida to Palm Beach for the purpose of luring 
minor girls to his mansion to sexually abuse and/or batter them. He used the telephone to contact 
these minor girls for the purpose of coercing them into acts of prostitution and to enable himself 
to commit sexual battery against them and/or acts of lewdness in their presence, and he conspired 
with others, including his employee(s), assistant(s), driver(s), pilot(s), and/or agent(s), to 
facilitate these acts and to avoid police detection. Defendant's systematic pattern of sexually 
exploitative behavior described above also occurred in Defendant's other domestic and/or 
international residences, places oflodging, and/or modes of transportation. 
17. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Defend.ant used his money, 
wealth, and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then minor Plaintiff. 
A vulnerable young girl, Plaintiff was merely a seventeen year old high school student when she 
was first lured into Defendant's sexually exploitative world in or about January 2004. Plaintiff 
was recruited while at work by a co-worker, one of the minor victims Defendant paid to procure 
underage females. Plaintiff went to Defendant's Palm Beach mansion accompanied by this co-
worker. Upon arriving, Plaintiff was led by one of Defendant's assistants up a flight of stairs to a 
spa room with a shower and a massage table. Defendant entered this room wearing only a towel. 
Defendant suddenly removed his towel, exposing his naked body, and then lay on the massage

table. Defendant told Plaintiff to massage his back and take off her clothing, which she refused 
to do. Defendant then began to try to touch the minor Plaintiff and/or take off her clothing. 
After Defendant's relentless pawing, she reluctantly removed some of her clothing. During this 
encounter, Defendant turned over on his back and fondled Plaintiffs breasts, despite her 
repeatedly telling him not to do so. As Plaintiff massaged Defendant, Defendant proceeded to 
masturbate until ejaculation. Defendant then paid Plaintiff two hundred dollars, and Plaintiff 
was escorted out of Defendant's mansion and left Defendant's property. 
18. 
A similar pattern of grooming continued, and the sexual exploitation 
progressively escalated, over the course of approximately seventeen months during which 
Defendant would often travel to Palm Beach. Prior to arriving and wf·,ile in Palm Beach, 
Defendant and/or his agent(s) would frequently call Plaintiff at her home telephone number 
and/or other telephone numbers, arranging for encounters with her for Defendant, sometimes 
twice daily. While usually such contacts were made by his assistants, Defendant personally 
called Plaintiff repeatedly, despite being told to leave Plaintiff alone. After the first few 
encounters, Defendant coerced Plaintiff to remove all her clothing, and Defendant penetrated the 
minor Plaintiffs vagina digitally. Defendant sexually abused and/or battered and/or exploited 
Plaintiff at least a hundred times between approximately January 2004 and May 2005. Such 
exploitation included, but was not limited to, Defendant's sexual abuse and battery of Plaintiff 
with vibrator(s), back massager(s), his finger(s), and his penis. At times, Defendant manipulated 
Plaintiff to interact sexually with another female. During one encounter, Dt!fendant penetrated 
the minor Plaintiffs vagina with his penis, all the while narrating and demonstrating his sexual 
battery of Plaintiff to another female present in the room. While some of the precise dates that 
Defendant's acts of sexual exploitation occurred are unknown to Plaintiff, these dates are known

to Defendant, as he and/or his assistants kept written records, some of which are in the custody 
of law enforcement, of each instance in which he committed lewd acts upon minor girls, 
including the then minor Plaintiff. 
19. 
Defendant's preference for underage girls was well-known to those who regularly 
procured them for him. The above-described acts of abuse began to occur during a time when 
Defendant knew that Plaintiff was a minor. Defendant, at all times material to this cause of 
action, knew and/or should have known of Plaintiff's age of minority. In fact, Defendant 
repeatedly urged the minor Plaintiff to become legally emancipated in order to accompany him 
as he traveled, both nationally and internationally. Additionally, Defendant, knowing that 
Plaintiff was merely seventeen years old, lured her by inviting her to stay with him at his 
mansion in Manhattan and arranging and/or paying for airplane tickets, theater tickets, and a 
personal chauffeur as gifts for her upcoming birthday. 
20. 
As part of Defendant's persistent process of grooming Plaintiff and immersing her 
in his lewd and abusive lifestyle, Defendant regularly showered the adoL~3cent Plaintiff with 
gifts, including, but not limited to lingerie, flowers, bikini bathing suit(s), art book(s), purse(s), 
envelopes of U.S. currency, use of a car, and/or other accoutrements. 
21. 
Defendant possessed photographs of nude underage girls, some of which may 
have been taken with hidden cameras set up in his residence in Palm Beach. On the day of 
Defendant's arrest, police found two hidden cameras and photographs of underage girls in 
Defendant's mansion. Defendant took lewd photographs of Plaintiff with his hidden cameras 
and transported lewd photographs of Plaintiff and other victims elsewhere using a facility or 
means of interstate and/or foreign commerce. On one occasion, Defendant manipulated the 
minor Plaintiff to pose nude for him and photographed her using several rolls of film. One or

more of those nude photographs of Plaintiff that were taken by the Defendant when she was a 
minor were confiscated by the Palm Beach Police Department during its execution of a search 
warrant of Defendant's Palm Beach mansion on October 20, 2005. 
22. 
Defendant was particularly skillful at discerning his minor victims' respective 
hopes, dreams, and ambitions. As he did with many of his victims, Defendant lured Plaintiff 
early-on with modeling opportunities, impressing her with his modeling business and contacts 
with supermodels, indicating that he could help her with a modeling career. 
23. 
Knowing that the minor Plaintiff was an excellent student and desired to attend 
New York University or Columbia University, Defendant pretended to show great interest in her 
college admission, and offered to help her with her applications and to assist her with her 
tuition. Defendant had told Plaintiff of his substantial connections within the academic 
community, a matter about which he often bragged. Defendant took it upon himself to take 
control of Plaintiff's college application process and led Plaintiff to believe that he was sincere 
about helping her. Even though she had earned a Bright Futures Scholarship to the Florida 
college of her choice, Defendant insisted that she would not need it, and that, with his 
involvement, she would be admitted into one or both of the universities in New York. As a 
result of Defendant's manipulation, Plaintiff did not apply timely for the Bright Futures 
Scholarship or to any college, and therefore missed the fall semester of her freshman year. When 
the Palm Beach Police Department executed the search warrant on Defend.m1t's mansion, among 
the artifacts found and confiscated were Plaintiff's high school transcript. 
24. 
In June 2008, after an investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department, the 
State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's 
Office, Defendant entered pleas of "guilty" to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in

violation of Fla. Stat. § 796.07, and one count of solicitation of a minor to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Fla. Stat. § 796.03 in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
25. 
As a condition of that plea, Defendant entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement, 
Addendum, and Affirmation (collectively, the "NPA") with the United States Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of Florida on September 24, 2007, October 29, 2007, and December 7, 
2007, respectively. In so doing, Defendant acknowledged that Plaintiff was one of his victims 
and agreed to the following provisions of the NP A : 
8. If any of the [acknowledged victims] elects to file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and 
Epstein waives his right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest 
damages up to an amount agreed to between the identified individual and Epstein, 
so long as the identified individual elects to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, and agrees to waive any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to 
state, federal or common law. 
10. Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 18 
US.C. §2255, as set forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's signature on 
this agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or settlements by Epstein 
are to be construed as admissions of evidence or evidence of civil or criminal 
liability or a waive of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person, whether 
or not her name appears on the list provided by the United States ( emphasis 
added). 
26. 
Plaintiff was among the individuals identified by the United States Attorney's 
Office as victims of Defendant upon whose testimony it intended to base its federal prosecution 
of Defendant for his illegal conduct. Consequently, Defendant is estopped by his state court plea 
and the Non-Prosecution Agreement from denying the acts alleged in this Complaint and must 
effectively admit liability to Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 103.
