CASE NO.:  08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
________________________________/ 
 
PLAINTIFF’S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE 
CIVIL RICO CASE STATEMENT PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 12.1 
 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rule 7.1(A) of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for an enlargement of time to file a Civil 
RICO Case Statement under Local Rule 12.1 until fifteen days after the Court rules on her 
motion to remand, which will be filed on or about August 18, 2008.   
1. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008.  (DE 1).   
2. Because Plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action under section 772.103, Florida 
Statutes, she is required to file a Civil RICO Case Statement within thirty days of 
removal.  See S.D. Fla. L.R. 12.1.   
3.  Plaintiff believes this action was improperly removed from state court and shall file 
a motion to remand on or about August 18, 2008.  It is Plaintiff’s contention that the 
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because it does not involve a 
federal question or parties with complete diversity of citizenship.

4. If this action was improperly removed, Plaintiff should not be required to expend the 
time and expense necessary to create and file a Civil Rico Cast Statement, which 
would not be required in Florida state court.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request the Court grant her motion for an 
enlargement of time to file a Civil RICO Case Statement until fifteen days after the Court rules 
on her motion to remand.
