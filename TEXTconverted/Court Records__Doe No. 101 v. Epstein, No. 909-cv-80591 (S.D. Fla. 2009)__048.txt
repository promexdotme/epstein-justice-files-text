Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/09/2009   Page 1 of 5
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
JANE DOE No. 101, 
Civil Action No. 09-80591-CIV-Marra/Johnson 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
____________ / 
PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO.101 'S MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME 
AND PAGE LIMITS FOR RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS 
THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, 
FOR A MORE DEFINITE ST A TEMENT 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 101 ("Plaintiff'), moves this Court for an order enlarging the time 
and page limits in which she must reply to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended 
Complaint or, in the Alternative, for a More Definite Statement. The grounds for this motion are as 
follows: 
1. 
Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint [DE 9] was filed on May 1, 2009. 
2. 
Pursuant to an unopposed motion for enlargement, Defendant filed his Motion to 
Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint or, in the Alternative, for a More Definite Statement 
( "Motion to Dismiss") on May 26, 2009. [DE 29] The Motion is 36 pages. 
3. 
Ordinarily, a response to the Motion to Dismiss would be due on June 12, 2009. As 
it happens, however, the Court has set a hearing on that very day for all cases consolidated for 
discovery and procedural issues under the case known as Jane Doe No. 2 vs. Jeffrey Epstein, Case 
No.09-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON. 
Apparently the Court set the hearing as the result of 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/09/2009   Page 2 of 5
Defendant's seeking to stay/continue all civil cases pending against him and the Court's own inquiry 
as to whether the Defendant is in breach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement between the Defendant 
and the United States. 
4. 
Under any circumstances, responding to Defendant's Motion would take more 
than the usual time allotted under the Local Rules for the Southern District of Florida, because of 
its length, comprehensiveness and complexity. In this instance, however, the.fact and importance 
of the hearing set for June 12th is a further complication which will likely affect the substance of 
Plaintiffs response, as well as its timing. Furthermore, Defendant's motion combines two motions 
in one 36 page document. Plaintiff seeks leave to file an equal number of pages in response. 
5. 
The issues raised by Defendant's Motion to Stay/Continue the Civil Cases Pending 
Against Him and the Court's inquiry are intertwined with many of those issues that will necessarily 
be involved in Plaintiffs response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. It would be a waste of the 
time of the undersigned attorneys to prepare a response to the Motion to Dismiss and of the judicial 
labor involved in reviewing it, when the response may be made obsolete, irrelevant or incomplete 
on the very day it is due as the result of matters to be discussed at the hearing on June 12th. 
6. 
This motion is not made for the purpose of delay and should be granted in the interest 
of equity and fairness. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 101, requests an enlargement of time ofup to 14 
days and page limits of up to 36 pages in which she must reply to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss 
the First Amended Complaint or, in the Alternative, for a More Definite Statement, so as to make 
her reply due five (5) days after the Court issues its ruling resulting from the hearing set for June 12, 
2009, or on June 26, 2009, whichever is later.
