6. 
This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. § 2255. 
7. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a), as a 
substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, was an adult male, 
approximately 50 years old. Epstein is known as a billionaire financier and money manager with 
a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power, 
and influence. He owns a fleet of aircraft that includes a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a 
Boeing 727. Until his incarceration, he maintained his principal place of residence in the largest 
home in Manhattan, a 51,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on the Upper East Side. Upon 
information and belief, he also owns a $6.8 million mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a $30 
million 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico he named "Zorro," and a 70-acre private island known 
as Little St. James in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The allegations herein concern 
Defendant's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
9. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant has a sexual preference for underage 
minor girls. He engaged in a plan, scheme, or enterprise in which he gained access in his home 
to countless relatively economically disadvantaged minor girls, sexually assaulted or molested 
these girls, and then gave them money. 
10. 
Beginning in or around 2001 through in or around September 2007, Defendant 
used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor children to engage in a systematic 
pattern of sexually exploitative behavior. 
11. 
Defendant's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. 
Defendant coerced and enticed impressionable, vulnerable, and relatively economically less

fortunate minors to participate in various acts of sexual misconduct that he committed upon 
them. Defendant's scheme involved the use of underage girls as well as other individuals to 
recruit other underage girls. Upon information and belief, Defendant or an authorized agent 
would call and alert Defendant's assistants shortly before or after he arrived at his Palm Beach 
residence. His assistants would seek out economically disadvantaged and underage girls from 
West Palm Beach and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered-
generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session-and who Defendant and/or his assistants 
perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility issues if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. The then minor Plaintiff and other minor girls, some as young as 
14 years old, were transported to Defendant's Palm Beach county mansion by Defendant's 
employees, agents, and/or assistants in order to provide Defendant with "massages." 
12. 
Defendant would pay the procurer of each girl's "appointment" approximately 
$200. Many of the instances of illegal sexual conduct committed by Defendant were perpetrated 
with the assistance, support, and facilitation of at least three assistants who helped him 
orchestrate this child exploitation enterprise. These assistants would often arrange times for 
underage girls to come to Defendant's residence, transport or cause the transportation of 
underage girls to Defendant's residence, escort the underage girls to the massage room where 
Defendant would be waiting or would enter shortly thereafter, urge the underage girls to remove 
their clothes, deliver cash from Defendant to the underage girls and/or their procurers at the 
conclusion of each "massage appointment," and, upon information and belief, take nude 
photographs and/or videos of the underage girls' for Defendant without their knowledge. 
13. 
Epstein designed the scheme to secure a private place in Defendant's mansion 
where only persons employed and invited by Epstein would be present, so as to reduce the 
chance of detection of Defendant's sexual abuse and prostitution as well as to make it more

difficult for the minor girls to flee the premises and/or to credibly report his actions to law 
enforcement or other authorities. The girls were usually transported by his employees, agents, 
and/or assistants or by a taxicab paid for by Defendant in order to make it difficult for the girls to 
flee his mansion. 
14. 
Upon arrival at Defendant's mansion, each underage victim would generally be 
introduced to one of Defendant's assistants, who would gather the girl's personal contact 
information. The minor girl would then be led up a flight of stairs to a room that contained a 
massage table and a large shower. The staircase leading to the room was plastered with nude 
photographs of young girls, including some photographs depicting two or more young girls 
engaged in lewd acts. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, had such 
photographs in each of his four homes and on his computer. 
15. 
At times, if it was the girl's first "massage" appointment, another female would 
be in the room to "lead the way" until Defendant would have her leave. Generally, Defendant 
would start his massage wearing only a small towel, which eventually would be removed. 
Defendant would direct the girl to massage him, giving her specific instructions as to where and 
how he wanted to be touched, and then direct her to remove her clothing. He would then 
perform one or more lewd, lascivious, and sexual acts, including masturbation, fondling the 
minor's breasts and/or sexual organs, touching the minor's vagina with a vibrator and/or back 
massager, digitally penetrating her vagina, performing intercourse, oral sex, and/or anal sex, 
and/or coercing or attempting to coerce the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or prostitution. The 
exact degree of molestation and frequency with which the sexual crimes took place varied and is 
not yet completely known; however, at least when Defendant was in Palm Beach, Florida, such 
acts occurred usually on a daily basis and, in most instances, several times a day.

16. 
As previously stated in paragraph 14, Defendant displayed nude photographs of 
underage girls throughout his homes in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. Upon infonnation and belief, some of the photographs in the possession of 
Defendant were taken with hidden cameras set up throughout his home in Palm Beach. On the 
day of his arrest, police found two hidden cameras and photographs of underage girls on a 
computer in Defendant's home. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, may 
have taken lewd photographs of Plaintiff, Jane Doe, with his hidden cameras and may have 
transported lewd photographs of Plaintiff (among many other victims) to his other residences and 
elsewhere using a facility or means of interstate commerce. 
17. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Defendant used his money, 
wealth, and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then minor Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, was recruited by one of Defendant's agents to give Defendant a massage for 
compensation. Plaintiff was apprehensive, but needed the money and finally agreed to go. 
Plaintiff was first b10ught to Defendant's mansion in or about the spring of 2003, when she was 
merely 17 years old and in high school. Epstein's procurer drove her to Jeffrey Epstein's 
mansion. Plaintiff was led up a flight of stairs by a blonde woman to a spa room with a shower 
and a massage table, where she was left alone. A woman with dark hair, an accent, and naked 
from the waist up entered and tried to coax Plaintiff to remove her shirt, but Plaintiff refused. 
After the woman showed Plaintiff how to use the lotions that were there, the woman left. 
Defendant walked in wearing only a small towel. He lay down on the massage table still 
wearing the small towel, and Plaintiff began to massage his shoulders and neck. Nervously, she 
asked him what he did for a living. Defendant responded that he was a scientist. Defendant 
asked Plaintiff what year she would graduate high school, to which Plaintiff honestly replied that 
she would graduate in 2004. Plaintiff massaged Defendant's lower back and calves. Defendant

told her to remove his towel. Defendant told her that he had just worked out and wanted his 
buttocks massaged. Although disgusted, she was afraid to refuse and did it. At some point, 
Defendant ordered Plaintiff to remove her clothes. In shock, fear, and trepidation, Plaintiff partly 
complied, removing only her shirt and bra. When Defendant turned over, Plaintiff was afraid 
and embarrassed and she wanted to leave. 
Defendant repeatedly told her to relax and 
complimented her, saying that she had a nice body. Defendant then pulled Plaintiff closer to 
him. He began masturbating and then began fondling her breasts. He asked her to do more and 
mentioned more money, which she adamantly declined. Defendant continued masturbating until 
he ejaculated. Plaintiff next recalls that she received $200 and was transported by the procurer, 
whom she later learned received $200 for having brought her to Epstein's mansion. 
18. 
Defendant thereafter lured the then minor Plaintiff to the Epstein mansion on at 
least one and perhaps two other occasions in the spring and/or summer of 2003. The procurer 
made another appointment for her to return, but Plaintiff didn't want to see Defendant. By 
having his assistants continue to contact Plaintiff and attempt to lure her to the mansion for other 
sexual acts, Defendant engaged in a continuous course of conduct that injured Plaintiff upon 
each instance of contact and/or abuse. 
19. 
In addition to the direct sexual abuse and molestation of the then minor Plaintiff, 
Defendant used his money, wealth, and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and 
influence the then minor Plaintiff to bring him another minor girl in a promised exchange for 
money. Rather than go herself, Plaintiff and the procurer took another girl there one time. 
20. 
As a result of these encounters with Defendant, Plaintiff, Jane Doe, has in the past 
suffered, and will in the future suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, 
psychological and/or psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, 
loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy, and

other damages associated with Defendant's controlling and manipulating her into a perverse and 
unhealthy way of life. 
21. 
Any assertions by Defendant that he was unaware of the age of the then minor 
Plaintiff are belied by her telling him her high school graduation year, as well as his own actions, 
and are rendered irrelevant by the provision of applicable federal statutes concerning the sexual 
exploitation and abuse of a minor child. Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, at all times material to this 
cause of action, knew and should have known of Plaintiffs age of minority. 
In fact, his 
preference for underage girls was well-known to those who regularly procured them for him. 
22. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, committed the above-referenced acts upon the then 
minor Plaintiff in violation of federal statutes condemning the coercion and enticement of a 
minor to engage in prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual 
conduct, sex trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor children, transport of visual 
depictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, transport of child pornography, child 
exploitation enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those crimes 
designated in 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), § 2423(b), § 2423(e), § 2251, § 2252, § 2252A(a)(l), § 
2252A(g)(l), and§ 1591. 
23. 
After investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State 
Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of Florida, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, entered pleas of "guilty" to 
various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the 
procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution in June 2008 in the Fifteenth Judicial 
Circuit in Palm Beach County, Florida. Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is in the same position as if 
he had been tried and convicted of the sexual offenses committed against Plaintiff and, as such,

interstate or foreign commerce child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(1). As 
previously stated in paragraphs 14, 16, and 37, upon information and belief, Defendant displayed 
a myriad of photographs of underage girls throughout his homes in New York, Palm Beach, New 
Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Upon information and belief, many of the photographs in 
the possession of Defendant were taken with hidden cameras set up throughout his home in Palm 
Beach. On the day of his arrest, police found two hidden cameras and photographs of underage 
girls on a computer in Defendant's home. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, may have taken lewd photographs of Plaintiff, Jane Doe, with his hidden cameras and 
may have transported lewd photographs of Plaintiff (among many other victims) to his other 
residences and elsewhere using a facility or means of interstate commerce. 
42. 
As previously stated in paragraph 21, any assertions by Defendant that he was 
unaware of the age of the then minor Plaintiff are belied by his actions and rendered irrelevant by 
the provision of applicable federal and state statutes concerning the sexual exploitation and abuse 
of a minor child. Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, at all times material to this cause of action, knew 
and should have known of Plaintiffs age of minority. In fact, his preference for underage girls 
was well-known to those who regularly procured them for him. 
43. 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, was a victim of one or more offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, and, as such, asserts a cause of action against Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, pursuant to this 
Section of the United States Code.
