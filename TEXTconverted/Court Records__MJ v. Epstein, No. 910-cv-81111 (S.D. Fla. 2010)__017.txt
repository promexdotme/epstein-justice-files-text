UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
 
CASE NO.  9:10-CV-81111-WPD 
 
M.J.,   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
Vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, and 
SARAH KELLEN,  
 
 
Defendants. 
_________________________________/ 
 
M.J.’S MOTION FOR PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE RELATING TO 
CORRESPONCE WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE. 
 
 
Plaintiff, M.J., hereby files this motion to have defendant Epstein ordered to 
preserve evidence – specifically (1) e-mail correspondence between Matthew Menchel 
at the United States Attorney’s Office and Lilly Ann Sanchez, an Epstein attorney, 
regarding Epstein’s plea negotiation over federal and state sex offenses, and (2) 
correspondence between the United States Attorney’s Office and Ken Starr, another 
Epstein attorney, regarding Epstein’s federal and state sex offenses and the 
prosecution or non-prosecution of such offenses.  In previous litigation in this Court, 
Epstein did not produce this correspondence, despite being under court order to do so.  
This gives rise to a reasonable inference that Epstein may be deliberately withholding 
this correspondence, possibly with the intent to deny its existence.  Accordingly, the 
Court should specifically order Epstein to preserve any such correspondence as 
possible evidence in M.J.’s case.

On July 20, 2009, plaintiff Jane Doe (a victim of Epstein’s sexual abuse similar to 
M.J.) filed a motion to compel production of various previously-requested documents, 
including discovery provided to Epstein by state and federal prosecutors in the criminal 
cases against him and correspondence between his criminal defense attorneys and 
state and federal prosecutors during the criminal investigation.  Case no. 9:08-cv-
80119, DE210.  (Exhibit 1)  Specifically, her motion sought production of the following: 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
Request No. 7:  All discovery information obtained by you or your 
attorneys as a result of the exchange of discovery in the State criminal 
case against you or the Federal investigation against you. 
 
Request No. 9:  Any documents or other evidentiary materials provided to 
local, state, or federal law enforcement investigators or local, state or 
federal prosecutors investigating your sexual activities with minors. 
 
Request No. 10:  All correspondence between you and your attorneys and 
state or federal law enforcement or prosecutors (includes, but not limited 
to, letters to and from the States Attorney’s office or any agents thereof). 
 
(DE210 at pp. 10-12 (emphases added)).  Epstein obtained an extension of time in 
which to respond and, two-and-a-half months later, on October 6, 2009, Epstein filed an 
objection to producing these items primarily on Fifth Amendment grounds (DE339).  
(Exhibit 2).  On October 16, 2009, Jane Doe promptly filed a reply in support of her 
motion (DE354). (Exhibit 3) On January 22, 2010, Jane Doe filed a notice that more 
than 90 days had elapsed since the filing of her motion (DE453).  (Exhibit 4) 
 
On February 4, 2010, the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part 
Jane Doe’s motion to compel, specifically ruling that Epstein had to produce the

discovery provided to him by state and federal prosecutors and the requested 
correspondence, rejecting Fifth Amendment and other objections raised by Epstein.  
(case no. 9:08-cv-80119, DE462).  (Exhibit 5) The magistrate judge specifically granted 
requests 7, 9, and 10.  Id. at 10 (“Accordingly, Epstein is ordered to produce the 
documents subjects to these Requests [i.e., requests 7, 9, and 10] within ten (10) days 
from the date hereof.”).   
 
Epstein then filed for an extension of time in which to appeal (DE464),  (Exhibit 
6) which Jane Doe opposed on grounds of delay (DE465)  (Exhibit 7).  On February 11, 
2010, the Court granted in part and denied in part the extension of time, specifically 
warning Epstein that “[i]n the event that Magistrate Judge Johnson’s February 4, 2010 
Order is affirmed on appeal, Defendant will have three (3) business days from the date 
of this Court’s order to produce the documents at issue.”   (DE468)  (Exhibit 8).  
Epstein then ultimately filed his appeal/motion for reconsideration of the magistrate 
decision on February 26, 2010. (DE477)  (Exhibit 9).   On March 10, 2010, Jane Doe 
then filed her response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for reconsideration. (DE. 
485).  (Exhibit 10)   
 
On April 1, 2010, the magistrate judge rejected Epstein’s challenge, reaffirming 
his earlier order that “compelled production from state and federal prosecutors in the 
criminal case against him.”  (DE513).  (Exhibit 11) 
 
On May 6, 2010, the court held a status conference on the appeal (which also 
involved other consolidated cases raising similar appeals and issues).  The Court asked 
the parties to attempt to reach a resolution of issues surrounding Epstein’s net worth.

On May 12, 2010, Epstein filed a “Consolidated” Rule 4 Review and Appeal of 
Portions of the Magistrate Judge’s orders (DE545). (Exhibit 12) On May 27, 2010, Jane 
Doe filed a “protective” response to the consolidated reply, noting that she had 
previously responded to all of the arguments raised by the appeal and that the 
“consolidated” appeal did not require any new response from her (DE551).  (Exhibit 13) 
 
On Friday, June 25, 2010, this Court entered an order affirming the magistrate 
judge’s discovery orders in all respects (case no. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, DE572) (Exhibit 
14) and, as it previously warned Epstein, requiring Epstein to produce the discovery 
materials within three business days.    
 
At this point, despite having had a year to assemble the requested discovery 
items and prepare for their production – and more than four months since the Court’s 
warning to be prepared to produce the documents on three days notice – Epstein began 
filing motions to restrict production.  On Monday evening, June 28, 2010, at 
approximately 5:11 p.m., Epstein filed a motion for a protective order regarding 
dissemination of the materials (case no. 9:09-cv-80893, DE170) (Exhibit 15). On 
Tuesday morning, June 29, 2010, at approximately 9:31 a.m., the Court summarily 
denied the motion (DE172) (Exhibit 16 – no actual written order).  Then, as the 
deadline for production drew even nearer, on Wednesday, June 30, 2010, at 
approximately 2:19 p.m., Epstein filed a motion for a right to redact tax returns that were 
being produced and informed the Court in his Motion that he was going to go ahead and 
only produce redacted tax returns (DE182).  (Exhibit 17)  Shortly thereafter, Epstein 
began transmitting redacted returns to Jane Doe’s counsel via email.  Acting with 
Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 17   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 4 of 9

impressive speed, at approximately 2:33 p.m., the Court summarily denied Epstein’s 
motion (DE183).  (Exhibit 18 – No actual written Order) 
 
Following these actions by the Court, late on June 30, 2010, defendant Epstein 
made his production of unredacted tax returns electronically to Jane Doe’s counsel.  
However, Epstein remarkably still failed to produce the correspondence he was required 
to produce in two critical ways.  First, Epstein did not produce any information he had 
obtained from the state during discovery of the criminal investigation against him.  
Indeed, because he had not (apparently in his view) obtained any federal discovery 
during the criminal investigation, he turned over nothing at all responsive to Jane Doe’s 
Requests No. 7 and No. 9.   And similarly, with regard to correspondence from the 
prosecutors, Epstein also produced only correspondence with federal prosecutors – not 
with state prosecutors. Of course, this significantly limited the production he made, as 
Epstein pled guilty to state sex charges rather than federal sex charges – leaving Jane 
Doe with no correspondence or discovery from the State. 
 
Second, with regard to his correspondence with federal prosecutors that he did 
produce, Epstein redacted anything coming from attorneys, leaving only the responses 
from the federal prosecutors.  The result is an often unintelligible mishmash of back-
and-forth emails, where only half of what is being said is disclosed.  It forced Jane Doe 
to read everything out of context and severely limits the utility of what was produced.   
 
On July 1, 2010, Jane Doe filed a motion seeking to have Epstein held in 
contempt and sanctioned for not properly producing discovery materials.  (DE-190 ). 
(Exhibit 19).  On July 6, 2010, Epstein settled his case against Jane Doe.  At that time,

Jane Doe had correspondence primarily between Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz and 
federal prosecutors.  She had no correspondence between Epstein attorney Lilly Ann 
Sanchez and federal or state prosecutors; she likewise had no correspondence 
between Epstein attorney Ken Starr and federal or state prosecutors.   
 
Only recently was Bradley Edwards, Esq., informed that there exists e-mail 
correspondence between Matthew Menchel at the United States Attorney’s Office and 
Lilly Ann Sanchez, an Epstein attorney.  Additionally, he was told that there exists a 
significant amount of correspondence between the United States Attorney’s Office and 
Ken Starr, another Epstein attorney.  Declaration of Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., at 21-
22.  (Exhibit 20)  Edwards immediately sent a letter to Chris Knight, counsel for 
Epstein, inquiring about the existence of such correspondence that was not produced.  
(Exhibit 21).  Joseph Ackerman, another attorney for Jeffrey Epstein, did speak with 
Mr. Edwards about this correspondence and expressed that he did not feel an obligation 
or responsibility to attempt to confirm or deny the existence of the correspondence in 
question nor to produce any additional correspondence.   
LEGAL MEMORANDUM 
 
It is obvious from the procedural history recounted above that Epstein has gone 
to great lengths to avoid producing correspondence with prosecutors about his liability 
for committing sex offenses.  There also now exists a strong reason for believing that 
Epstein violated Judge Marra’s discovery orders in a case similar to this one by 
deliberately withholding evidence.  It is a matter of public discussion, for example, that 
Epstein hired attorney Ken Starr to help defend him against criminal sex offense

charges.  See Wikipedia Entry for Jeffrey Epstein, “Solicitation of Prostitution” (visited 
Oct. 30, 2010).  And yet Epstein did not produce any correspondence between Mr. Starr 
and federal prosecutors.  M.J.’s undersigned counsel has been informed that such 
correspondence exists.  Accordingly, Epstein should have produced it on June 30, 2010 
– but did not do so.   
 
When there is a good faith belief that evidence may be lost or destroyed, the 
Court has authority to order the preservation of such evidence.  See AT&T Mobility 
L.L.C. v. Dynamic Cellular Corp., 2008 WL 2139518 (S.D. Fla. May 7, 2008); Tracfone 
Wireless, Inc v. King Trading, Inc., 2008 WL 918243, at #1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 13, 2008) 
(finding “a legitimate concern for the continuing existence and maintenance of the 
integrity of the evidence in question absent an order preserving the evidence.”).  The 
correspondence may be highly relevant M.J.’s claims, as it may indeed prove Epstein’s 
awareness of his guilt of sex offenses, as well as liability to many other girls beside M.J. 
– evidence that will be admissible in this case under Fed. R. of Evid. 415 as well as to 
prove punitive damages.  There should be no significant burden on Epstein, as the 
material in question is legal correspondence, presumably maintained in a standard file 
by a large and well-resourced law firm.  Epstein is also a billionaire, who can hardly be 
heard to complain about the financial burden that such an order might impose on him.  
Accordingly, the evidence should be ordered preserved.   
CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL 
 
M.J.’s counsel has conferred with counsel for Epstein and was unable to reach 
an agreement as to this motion and understands Epstein to object to this motion.

CONCLUSION 
 
The Court should order Epstein to preserve all evidence regarding (1) e-mail 
correspondence between Matthew Menchel at the United States Attorney’s Office and 
Lilly Ann Sanchez, an Epstein attorney, regarding Epstein’s plea negotiation over 
federal and state sex offenses, and (2) correspondence between the United States 
Attorney’s Office and Ken Starr, another Epstein attorney, regarding federal and state 
sex offenses committed by Epstein and the prosecution or non-prosecution of such 
offenses.
