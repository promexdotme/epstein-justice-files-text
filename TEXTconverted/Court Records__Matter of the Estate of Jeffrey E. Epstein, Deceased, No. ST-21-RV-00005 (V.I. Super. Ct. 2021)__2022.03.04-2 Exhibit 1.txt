Case 
4 
Number 1, in the Matter of the Estate of 
5 
Jeffrey Epstein, ST-19-PB-80. 
6 
THE COURT: Counsel. 
7 
ATTORNEY BLOM: Good morning, 
8 
Your Honor. My name is Attorney Wil l iam Blum. 
9 
I 'm Counsel for t he Co-Executors of the estate 
10 
of Jeffrey Epstein. I am accompanied today by 
11 
Co-Counsel, Christopher Kroblin, Marjorie 
12 
Whalen sitting at Counsel's table, as well as 
13 
Shari D'Andrade sitting behind. 
Two mainland 
14 
attorneys who have been admi tted pro hac vice 
15 
in this matter, Attorney Andrew Tomback at the 
16 
end and Attorney Daniel Weiner. 
17 
If it please Your Honor, I would 
18 
like to start by --
19 
THE COURT: Attorney Blum, before 
20 
you proceed, first off, Good morni ng to you. 
21 
Good morni ng to Counsel. Do we have the pro 
22 
hac admission documents to file with the 
23 
Court? I'm going to ask that they be filed 
24 
wi th the Court. 
25 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We'll do so, Your 

Probate ST-1 9- PB- 0080 
5 
1 
2 
Honor. 
THE COURT: 
3 
be filed in due course. 
Well, they can just 
4 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Okay. 
5 
THE COURT: 
Let me just first 
6 
explain how we are going to work these 
7 
proceedings today because this is an unusual 
8 
probate proceeding, the Logistics of how 
9 
Counsel is to come forward to address the 
10 
Court. The estate counsels have been seated at 
11 
Counsel's table . 
12 
What I am now going to ask i s 
13 
that Counsel for other parties come to the 
14 
podium, identify themselves by names and their 
15 
client. 
Then I'm going to ask you to return 
16 
to the gallery. 
There are numerous motions 
17 
before the Court pending for today. I put them 
18 
in categories to be dealt with. It made sense 
19 
to me to categorize the motions because it 
20 
seems they fit into categories in my thinking. 
21 
As the motions are called by 
22 
category, Counsel would then indicate, after 
23 
the Estate has made its arguments to the 
24 
Court, i£ Counsel wishes to be heard, by 
25 
indication raise your hand and you come 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
6 
1 
forward. That is the only way the Court can 
2 
see how we are going to get through this today 
3 
to allow everyone to have an opportunity to 
4 
address the Court on the different issues. 
5 
Fair enough to everyone present in the 
6 
courtroom? 
7 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Thank you, Your 
8 
Honor. 
9 
THE COURT: Yes. Okay. Counsel 
10 
for claimants or other persons interested in 
11 
the estate, one at a time--I don't know how we 
12 
are going to do this. 
13

21 
Has the Court now heard from all counsel who 
22 
would like to be heard this morning? 
23 
The first motion that the Court 
24 
will consider is the Motion For Appointment of 
25 
Appraisers for real properties located in New 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
12 
1 
York, New Mexico and Florida. 
2 
This is a motion filed by the 
3 
estate by the Co-Executors where they move the 
4 
Court to appoint appraisers pursuant to Rule 
S 
12 A of the Virgin Islands Rules of Probate 
6 
and Fiduciary Proceedings to appoint 
7 
appraisers in the jurisdictions of New York, 
8 
New Mexico, Florida to appraise the real 
9 
property that may be of interest to this 
10 
estate. Counsel? 
11 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: Good morning, 
12 
Your Honor. 
13 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
14 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: The estate 
15 
16 
17 
filed a--
THE COURT: Just state your name. 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: My apologies. 
18 
Marjorie Whalen for the executors of the 
19 
estate. The estate filed a motion for 
20 
appointment of appraisers on January 17, 2020 . 
21 
This is a motion, Your Honor, to appoint three 
22 
appraisers for three properties in three 
23 
jurisdictions, in Florida, New Mexico and New 
24 
York. Each of the three proposed appraisers 
25 
have executed and submitted affidavits to the 

Probate ST-19-PB-00~0 
1 
Court affirming that they are competent and 
2 
qualified appraisers and that they are 
3 
licensed in their jurisdictions. 
4 
The first appraiser is Bryan J. 
5 
Rogers and he is proposed to appraise two 
6 
properties in New York. He is a licensed 
7 
appraiser and is Senior Vice President at 
8 
Miller, Samuel, Inc., which is a New York 
9 
based Real Estate Appraisal and Consulting 
10 
firm. 
11 
And the second appraiser is Jim 
12 
Connolly, and the executors seek his 
13 
appointment to appraise real property in New 
14 
Mexico. Mr. Connolly is a licensed appraiser 
15 
as well and has also submitted his affidavit 
16 
affirming his experience. 
17 
The third proposed appraiser is 
18 
Michael R. Slade and the estate seeks to 
19 
appoint him to appraise the property in 
20 
Florida. 
21 
THE COURT: Are you completed 
22 
with your argument or your information to the 
23 
Court? 
24 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: 
Yes. We have 
25 
submitted the affidavits and I believe we 
13 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
submitted everything needed to appoint these 
2 
appraisers and we have not received any 
3 
objection or opposition to our request for 
4 
their appointment. 
5 
THE COURT: 
Let me see if there 
6 
is any Counsel who wishes to address that 
14 
7 
motion for appointment of appraisers for real 
8 
properties located in New York, New Mexico and 
9 
Florida? 
10 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I would like 
11 
to --
12 
THE COURT: Attorney Smith. 
13 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Good morning, 
14 
Your Honor. 
With regard to the motion --
15 
THE COURT: 
Just identify 
16 
yourself. All Counsels, when you come to the 
17 
podium, again, identify yourselves by name, 
18 
please. 
19 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
Attorney 
20 
Ariel Smith on behalf of the Government of the 
21 
Virgin Islands. 
With regard to the motion 
22 
that was made earlier before the Court and 
23 
filed prior to that, one of the questions we 
24 
would ask the Court to inquire of the executor 
25 
who owns the properties from which they're 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
15 
seeking the appraisal and what interest do 
they represent in the estate because that was 
not clear from the motion nor the 
representations before this Court. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Attorney Smith 
and Attorney Whalen, Attorney Smith has nailed 
what this Court, the concerns this Court has 
concerning that motion - is that you are 
seeking for the court to appoint appraisers 
located in these jurisdictions. As I have it 
in the petition that was filed, petition for 
probate and for letters testamentary, The 
estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein does not own any 
real property. It's 
set forth --and I know 
this is the initial petition, but it's set 
forth that these properties in question are 
owned by corporations for which the decedent 
18 
may have owned shares in the corporation. 
19 
So, the question woul d be: 
What is 
20 
it that we are seeking to value? 
21 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That's it. 
22 
THE COURT: Is it the real 
23 
property or is it the shares, his ownership of 
24 
the shares? 
And I would say because the Court 
25 
has no jurisdiction over real property located 

1 
2 
Proba t e ST- 19-PB-0080 
outside of the jurisdiction, that is why the 
Court 
usually does not have to appoint 
16 
3 
appraisers located in any jurisdiction other 
4 
than the Virgin Is l ands. 
5 
And I know what you set forth as 
6 
the proposed rates for these appraisers. This 
7 
Court has a rate schedul e for its appraisers 
8 
that begins at $400 and does not exceed $450 
9 
for reports to be shared by two persons. 
10 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, if 
11 
I might add that the f i rst quarterly 
12 
accounting that was literally filed, I 
13 
bel i eve, either Friday or yesterday, reflects 
14 
no real estate owned by the decedent . 
15 
THE COURT: And Attorney Smi th 
16 
also, she is correct. 
In the first quarterl y 
17 
accounting filed with the Court, f iled 
18 
yesterday, the first quarterly accounting says 
19 
real property, none, and i t provides a 
20 
schedule as t o personal property and on that 
21 
schedule, valuation is provi ded for all the 
22 
corporate entities in which the decedent is 
23 
alleged to have owned 100 percent and I have 
24 
values for those. 
25 
So that's what the Court would 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
17 
believe the Court would need. 
What is the 
value of the share 
held by th 
decedent 
not 
to appraise the real property located in these 
jurisdictions because I would have no idea 
what is proposed by these appraisers is fair 
and reasonable. 
Attorney Blum. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Attorney Willi am 
Blum for the Co-Executors of the estate of 
Jeffrey Epstein. Your Honor, the real 
properties that we are seeking to be appraised 
are each found in separate corporations that 
are Virgin Islands corporations. Those are the 
only substantial assets of each of those 
corporations. 
So for us to be able to evaluate 
these stocks of these corporations, we need -
someone needs- to make a determination as to 
what is the value of the underlining real 
estate. 
Now if Your Honor is suggesting that 
we should make our own decision as to how to 
evaluate the property that's owned by these 
corporations, we would do so and then we would 
use that as evidence of the value of the 
stocks and perhaps if required, we coul d have 
a separate apprai ser who could affirm that 

Probate ST-19-PB-OOBO 
18 
1 
although it is sort of fairly obvious. 
2 
THE COURT: 
Well, Attorney Blum, 
3 
I'm saying if the shares are what is owned by 
4 
the estate 
5 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Correct. 
6 
THE COURT: The V.I. Corporations, 
7 
I'm assuming, they are still in operation and 
8 
have corporate government, whether Officers, 
9 
Board of Directors, continuing to function 
10 
that-- someone needs to make sure that their 
11 
cell phone or whatever electronic device they 
12 
have is turned off--it also would seem to me 
13 
these corporations would have had annual 
14 
reports, tax returns, something that would be 
15 
able to value what the value of the shares 
16 
held. 
17 
What I am addressing is the 
18 
motion to appoint appraisers to appraise real 
19 
property when I have the decedent does not own 
20 
any real property and any appraisal that I 
21 
sent or gave an order to would have been for 
22 
real property located here in the Virgin 
23 
Islands. 
So as it pertains to-- Attorney 
24 
25 
Smith? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
19 
1 
I would just ask, I think what is --Well, or 
2 
what the Court may want to inquire of is which 
3 
of the companies that was owned by the 
4 
decedent own these real properties since 
5 
that's what they are suggesting is the case. 
6 
That is not clear in the motion. 
7 
THE COURT: 
But it's set out in 
8 
the petition for probate: 
10,000 shares of 
9 
Maple, Inc., a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation 
10 
which holds title to Nine East 71 Street, New 
11 
York. 
12 
10,000 shares of Cypress, Inc., 
13 
a U.S. Virgin Islands Corporation which holds 
14 
title to 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New 
15 
Mexico; 
16 
10,000 shares of Laurel, Inc., a 
17 
u:s. Virgin Islands Corporation which holds 
18 
title to property located in Palm Beach, 
19 
Florida; 
20 
999 shares of SCIJEP, a french 
21 
company which holds title to some real 
22 
property located in Paris; 
23 
10,000 shares of Poplar, Inc., a 
24 
U.S. Virgin Islands corporation which holds 
25 
title to Great St. James Island. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
20 
1 
10,000 shares of Nautilus, Inc., 
2 
a U. S. Virgin Islands corporation which holds 
3 
title to Little St. James Island. 
4 
So it's set out in the petition. 
5 
So it would seem to me that's what the Court 
6 
and in the petition and the filing, there 
7 
was an estimated value provided for what those 
8 
shares would be so the Court sees no reason, 
9 
the Court 
would need to appoint an appraiser 
10 
to appraise the real property.' That 
11 
information should be to be given by the 
12 
corporation, the Officers, from whether your 
13 
annual report to verify it, and in your 
14 
quarterly accountings in the petition, we had 
15 
values presented, the first quarterly 
16 
accounting again has values presented so the 
17 
Court will deny the motion for the appointment 
18 
for the appraiser for the real property 
19 
located in New York, New Mexico and Florida. 
20 
So that motion is denied. 
21 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, if I 
22 
may, nevertheless, the estate will need to 
23 
appraise those properties, at least for estate 
24 
tax purposes in order to provide appropriate 
25 
value for the estate tax returns. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
21 
1 
THE COURT: The properties or the 
2 
shares? 
3 
ATTORNEY BLUM: The shares of 
4 
stock, the companies that owns the stock, that 
5 
owns the real property. 
Those are going to be 
6 
listed in the estate tax returns. 
7 
THE COURT: 
And I'm saying to 
8 
you, these are corporations functioning- -
9 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes. 
10 
THE COURT: With Officers, Board 
11 
of Directors who can do whatever is needed as 
12 
a corporate structure to valuate the shares 
13 
owned by its shareholders. 
14 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Thank you, Your 
15 
Honor. 
16 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
17 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I 
18 
would just say that this is kind of an 
19 
extraordinary circumstance because it appears 
20 
that in a number of these corporations the 
21 
decedent was the sole shareholder and I'm 
22 
concerned as to what that might suggest to the 
23 
estate what they are able to do without input 
24 
from the Court. 
25 
THE COURT: What I'm saying lS I 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
22 
1 
have it that these are corporations. 
I'm 
2 
assuming 
corporations that are operating 
3 
according to Virgin Islands corporate law or 
4 
any jurisdiction where they have been created . 
5 
Corporations having a creation separate and 
6 
apart from the shareholders or from the 
7 
estate. 
8 
The estate is saying we own 
9 
shares in these corporations. 
The Court at 
10 
this point does not know how the co-executors 
11 
are involved with the corporations. 
I 'm 
12 
assuming the corporation s are operati ng 
13 
separate and apart from the estate because 
14 
they are corporations. Unless I have something 
15 
different to inform me, I'm taking the 
16 
decedent own shares in the l ist ed 
17 
corporations - whether he own 100 percent, it 
18 
is s t ill entities separate and apart from his 
19 
estate. 
Okay, Attorney Blum? 
20 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Thank you. 
21 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes, Your Honor. 
22 
THE COURT: All right. Next motion 
23 
24 
25 
that was fi l ed on August 30, 2019. 
Motion for 
the appointment of a Master pur suant to Virgin 
Is l ands Rule of Civil Procedure 53 in whi ch 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
23 
1 
the Executors--co-executors move to appoint a 
2 
master, which in summary they set out to 
3 
assist the Court with what they believe would 
4 
be a complicated probate proceeding. 
5 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your 
6 
Honor. 
7 
8 
9 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Attorney Kroblin. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you~ 
10 
THE COURT: I said your name but 
11 
for the record. 
12 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes. 
13 
Christopher Kroblin on behalf of the executors 
14 
of the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Your Honor, 
15 
we submitted this motion in anticipation of 
16 
this estate involving much more work than the 
17 
average estate pending before this Court and 
18 
in particular to deal with a couple of issues, 
19 
one of which --and an important one --is 
20 
dealing with administrative costs of the 
21 
estate, particularly attorney fees that needs 
22 
Court approval. 
23 
We've submitted now four 
24 
different fee applications and we have, I 
25 
believe, two more that will be filed this week 

Probate ST- 19- PB- 0080 
1 
and another one or two next week. 
So that 
2 
brings it to about a t otal of eight fee 
3 
applications and they are ongoing. 
24 
4 
For a little background, Your 
S 
Honor, we have not addressed yet, there are 
6 
numerous lawsuits pending in the United 
7 
States. There are some 32 Plaintiffs that have 
8 
filed suits in different lawsuits and we have 
9 
retained, the estate has retained Counsel 
10 
travel ing to represent the estate in the 
11 
defense of those lawsuits, most all being 
12 
filed in New York at this time and some other 
13 
ones. 
14 
So Your Honor, the ·estate has 
15 
urgent need to appear in these matters and 
16 
defend the matters. They are currently, you 
17 
know, in progress. 
I guess at this junction 
18 
none of them have really gone to the d i scovery 
19 
phase yet but we understand if they were to go 
20 
under discovery which is imminent, that the 
21 
costs would skyrocket for the representation 
22 
of the estate. 
23 
So the need to timely approve 
24 
the fee applications, we find to be highly 
25 
important particularly with the number of 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
lawsuits pending and the matter of attorney 
2 
fees the estate has sustained in defense of 
25 
3 
these lawsuits. That's the reason we've asked 
4 
that the Court consider the appointment of a 
5 
Master to assist with those fee applications 
6 
and he may also be able to potentially assist 
7 
with other issues the Court may have or want 
8 
to refer to the Master. 
We've proposed 
9 
Britain Bryant who is here in the courtroom 
10 
with us today. 
11 
THE COURT: 
Attorney Bryant. 
12 
13 
Honor. 
14 
15 
ATTORNEY BRYANT: Yes, Your 
THE COURT: Good morning, Sir. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: And Your 
16 
Honor, he is the oldest practitioner in the 
17 
Virgin Islands Bar currently. 
18 
{Laughter} 
9 
THE COURT: Oldest practitioner? 
20 
I don't think that is what you want to say, 
21 
sir. He might be the longest serving 
22 
pra ti ioner. 
I think that is what you want 
23 
to say, the longest practice. 
24 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: That is 
25 
correct, That is correct. 
And Your Honor, he 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Probate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
26 
is, you know obviously, he has many years of 
experience, and has been more recently a 
partner in a large firm in the Virgin Islands 
and he is used to dealing with you know, 
engagement of attorneys and fee applications 
and knows how they are submitted under the 
Virgin Islands Court rules and we submit that 
he would be of assistance to the Court to 
prepare reports for the Court's 
consideration, you know, to review the fees, 
all the entries, the rates, and make a 
recommendation to Your Honor that may assist 
in moving these fee applications along so the 
Court can't be bogged down with that. 
We 
know there are many more other complicated 
issues that this Court is going to have to 
deal with and that are being presented in this 
estate and we think that it would be of great 
assistance to the more routine fee 
applications to have assistance .
. 
We filed our application 
pursuant to Virgin Islands Rules of Civil 
Procedure 53 which we believe the probate 
rules allow to look to the Rules of Civil 
Procedure when there's no rule on point in the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
27 
1 
probate rules. 
Rule 53 lays out the 
2 
requirements for the appointment of a Master. 
3 
In particular, Rule 53 authorizes the 
4 
appointment of a Master to address pretrial 
5 
and posttrial matters that cannot be 
6 
effectively and timely addressed by an 
7 
available Judge or Magistrate Judge. 
8 
Your Honor, we believe that 
9 
this would help address this aspect of the 
10 
case and move the fee applications along, some 
11 
of which have been pending for sometime now. 
12 
Particularly the Troutman Sanders fee 
13 
application. There are two now pending with a 
14 
third on its way. 
15 
THE COURT: Let me ask you this, 
16 
Attorney Kroblin. 
17 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes. 
18 
THE COURT: 
What fee application 
19 
comes before this Court? 
Which are the ones 
20 
that have been presented to this Court sitting 
21 
in probate? 
22 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: I believe any--
23 
the Court's order, when the initial order was 
24 
entered, required that all estate attorney 
25 
fees be approved by this Court. 

1 
2 
3 
4 
Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
THE COURT: Estate attorney fees? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: A-hem. 
THE COURT: 
Estate attorneys. 
Who are the estate attorneys? 
What law firm 
28 
5 
is the estate attorney? 
6 
ATTORNEY KROBLI N: Well, Your 
7 
Honor, my law firm, of course, is representing 
8 
the estate and the administration of the 
9 
estate but with regard to the lawsuits filed 
10 
in New York, the co-executors have been sued 
11 
on behalf of the estate, essentially. They 
12 
have been sued in a number of lawsuits and 
13 
those co-executors have gone out and retained 
14 
Counsel to represent them in the lawsuit, to 
15 
represent the es ate in the lawsuit , and so we 
16 
believe that those attorneys require approval 
17 
of this Court to be paid. If they do not, then 
18 
we've resol ved an issue, Your Honor, but if 
19 
they do and in an abundance of caution, we've 
20 
asked, you know, for approval from Your Honor 
21 
to not be in violation of the order. 
22 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you, 
23 
Sir. I s there anyone wishing to be heard on 
24 
the appointment of the Master? 
25 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor . 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
29 
1 
THE COURT: You know what. Also, 
2 
I looked for the appointment of the Master to 
3 
also assist in the settlement of claims, but 
4 
wouldn't that be addressed under that 
5 
Voluntary Claims Program? 
6 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN : Yes, Your Honor, 
7 
we fi l ed the motion for the Master prior to 
8 
filing the motion for that so we were unsure 
9 
how things would necessarily shake out, if you 
10 
will --
11 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
12 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: - - i n the 
13 
Voluntary Cl aims Progr am, our mot i on, so we 
14 
submit that if we do have a Master appointed, 
15 
you know, it coul d possibly come into p l ay at 
16 
some poi nt. 
It woul d be useful in assisting 
17 
with that in some manner, but I think it woul d 
18 
epend on how the Court considers to use the 
19 
claims program and how it is actually 
20 
structured and put together in the end. 
21 
THE COURT: Okay. 
Thank you, Sir . 
22 
Attorney Srni th. 
23 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes. 
24 
THE COURT: Just again, identify 
25 
yourself . 

Probat e ST- 19- PB-0080 
30 
1 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, I would, Your 
2 
Honor. 
Ariel Smith again on behalf of the 
3 
Government of the Virgin Islands. 
4 
First of all, Your Honor, we 
5 
have the utmost confidence in your ability to 
6 
handle this probate estate. 
7 
THE COURT: I'm glad you do. 
8 
ATTORNEY SMITH: The utmost. 
You 
9 
have had several years working in probate and 
10 
you're excellent in that particular area of 
11 
law so we would object just on those grounds. 
12 
Notwithstanding that, we have 
13 
some additional concerns. One, it appears that 
4 
the estate is seeking to use the decedent's 
15 
estate to pay expenses that-- let me rephrase 
16 
this . 
17 
The Court is correct that the 
18 
Court would evaluate fee a plications relating 
19 
to estate attorneys' expenses. The expenses 
20 
that they are seeking to have paid are 
21 
relating to lawsuits which are not necessaril y 
22 
expenses that are in the ordinary course of 
23 
the business or expenses that are directly 
24 
related to the running and the preservation of 
25 
the estate. 

Probat e ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
31 
1 
So I think the proper course 
2 
of action should have been when the lawsuits 
3 
are filed, the Court needs to be immediately 
4 
informed as to what is going on, a proper 
5 
motion be brought before the Court and then 
6 
they ask for the ability to retain Counsel as 
7 
opposed to retaining Counsel and -saying, Your 
8 
Honor, we need to pay these fees. 
9 
We're concerned about those 
10 
types of actions without the Court's 
11 
authority-- the CourtJs permission being 
12 
sought that would ultimately dissipate the 
13 
estate prematurely without this Court having 
14 
full knowledge of exactly what's going on. 
15 
THE COURT: But wouldn't the 
16 
Court 
have knowledge because the executors 
17 
are required to file quarterly accountings. 
18 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, first 
19 
of all, 
the executors have not even filed an 
20 
inventory so at this point, as we sit here 
21 
this morning, this Court nor the executors 
22 
based on the first quarterly accounting, know 
23 
exactly what the assets are within this 
24 
estate. 
25 
THE COURT: 
And if I understand 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
1 
it, they didn't file the inventory because 
2 
they were waiting for the appointment of the 
3 
appraisers; they believed the apprai sal was 
4 
necessary. 
We do have the first quarterly 
5 
accounting. 
6 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, Your 
7 
Honor, if you look at what they provided as 
8 
the firs t quarterly accounting, therers a 
9 
number of assets which they indicate to be 
10 
undeterminable that are right after the 
11 
statement that there's no r eal property and 
12 
then there's a number. 
13 
THE COURT: Determined by 
14 
appraisal . 
32 
15 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Right, but those 
16 
are assets that are rel ated to personal 
17 
property; meaning, watches, jewelry-- not the 
18 
real estate that t hey were suggesting as part 
19 
of their earlier motion. 
So it's a different 
20 
evaluation that needs to be done to fu l ly have 
21 
the Court understand what this estate consist 
22 
of. 
So we believe that the first quarterly 
23 
accounting is premature and not complete. 
24 
There are a number of issues with i t that we 
25 
can ta l k about when the Court gets to that 

F~obate ST-19-PB-0080 
33 
1 
motion. 
I don't want to be premature with 
2 
that but as far as a Special Master, we don't 
3 
think it's necessary and we think that we have 
4 
to be careful in this estate in having the 
5 
executors make decisions about expending 
6 
estate assets without previously seeking 
7 
permission by the Court and it's also clear in 
8 
the quarterly accounting that they have 
9 
10 
already begun to do so. 
THE COURT: 
Well, under the 
11 
terms of the Last Will and Testament of 
12 
Jeffrey E. Epstein dated August 8 of 2019 
13 
which was admitted into court at Paragraph C 
14 
(1), "the testator specifically authorize his 
15 
executors to appoint agents, attorneys of law, 
16 
consultants, investment advisors and to pay 
17 
for such services from the assets of my estate 
18 
without obtaining judicial authorization or 
19 
approval". The testator specifically provided 
20 
for that. 
21 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor--
22 
THE COURT: Let me continue. 
23 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 
24 
THE COURT: When the Court issued 
25 
the order, the Court's order, which is a 

Probate ST-1 9-PB- 00 80 
34 
1 
standing or er issued in eve 
estate provided 
2 
that attorney fees -hould not be paid--and 
3 
this was an order dated September 6 of 2019 
4 
--it provided that the co-executors shall not 
5 
pay from decedent's estate any attorneys fees 
6 
or co-executors fees for services rendered to 
7 
the estate without prior approval of this 
8 
Court. It contemplates Virgin Islands Rule of 
9 
Probate Procedure, Rule 18, that provides in 
10 
part, Simultaneously with the filing of the 
11 
final account, an administrator, executor or 
12 
attorney shall make application to the Court 
13 
for an award of fees and costs where 
14 
appropriate for services performed in the 
15 
execution or administration of an estate. 
16 
The fee petition shall clearly 
17 
state the hourly rate for fees charged for 
18 
services rendered, an explanation of the 
19 
services provided and specific dates and time 
20 
spent performing such service identified in 
21 
the petition. 
22 
The Probate Court reviews the 
23 
fees and expenses of probate counsel, estate 
24 
counsel because that is the work that is 
25 
before this Court-- whether in filings to the 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
Court, appearances before the Court, so the 
2 
Court can then make a determination whether 
3 
the fees sought, and the time expended was 
4 
reasonable given the nature of the estate. 
5 
This Court does not review as 
35 
6 
the co-executor who had the fiduciary duty to 
7 
represent the estate and preserve and protect 
8 
its assets, the Court does not then, when an 
9 
executor has to hire a counsel for a civil 
10 
proceeding, a counsel to represent the estate, 
11 
say with the bank and a mortgage proposal, 
12 
then say you have to now come in for me to 
13 
review those fees because I don't have that 
14 
work before me to determine if it's 
15 
reasonable. It's estate counsel the Court 
16 
reviews the fee application of and that has 
17 
been the practice of this Court, of the 
18 
Probate Division. 
19 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I understand 
20 
that, Your Honor. This particular case also 
21 
presents a unique circumstance in that on 
22 
January 17th, based on the filing of a CICO 
23 
action there was notice given to the Probate 
24 
Court with regard to the Government's lien in 
25 
an effort to preserve the assets of the estate 

Probate ST- 19- PB-0080 
1 
based on the pending CICO litigation. 
So I 
2 
think that particular event --
3 
THE COURT: Okay. 
4 
ATTORNEY SMITH: --changed, to 
5 
some extent, the Court's oversight over this 
6 
estate. 
7 
THE COURT: And I agree and that 
36 
8 
is something we are going to have to flesh out 
9 
if this hearing continues this morning--what 
10 
now happens when now the Government having 
11 
filed that 
lien, but to address that lien, 
12 
correct, and to address whatever civil 
13 
proceeding the Government is going to file, 
14 
would not the co-executors have to retain 
15 
counsel? 
16 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, the 
17 
co-executors have been served and counsel for 
18 
that proceeding has not made an appearance. 
19 
So to that end, we can address it when the 
20 
need arises. 
21 
THE COURT: Okay. 
I'm going to 
22 
pick up the attorneys fees in this matter. I'm 
23 
going to go to that now . And I have right now 
24 
concerning the appointment of a Master and I 
25 
understand what is set forth, I'm going to 

Probate ST-19-eB-OOBO 
37 
1 
deny the appointment of the Master without 
2 
prejudice. This Court, while there maybe quite 
3 
a number of filings; it may be a different 
4 
type of probate proceedings, I still see it as 
5 
a probate where persons have to, the 
6 
co-executors are going out to defend the 
7 
estate but as a probate, filing the quarterly 
8 
accountings, filing the inventory, keeping the 
9 
Court apprised as to what's going on. 
The 
10 
Court is not going to intervene in what may be 
11 
happening in New York. I have no authority to 
12 
do that. The report would be mailed back to me 
13 
that these matters have been settled. 
14 
Should we go and set up the 
15 
voluntary resolution program, it would be 
16 
settled from there. 
The co-executors have 
17 
started to convert assets because they have 
18 
the authority of law to do that. 
I see in 
19 
the quarterly accountings notations that 
20 
properties,vehicles may have been sold and 
21 
converted to cash; am I correct? 
22 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Right. 
23 
THE COURT: As the co-executors, 
24 
they have the authority by statute and by the 
25 
decedent's Last Will and Testament to do that 

Pr obate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
38 
1 
and all they are doing is keeping the Court 
2 
aware of where the assets are, how they are 
3 
being used. 
4-
So the ruling on the Master is 
5 
denied without prejudice at this point in the 
6 
proceedings. 
7 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you, 
8 
Your Honor. 
If I may just for my client's 
9 
sake just so to make sure that I understand 
10 
the ruling of the Court because the Order did 
11 
say, "the co-executors shall not pay from 
12 
decedent's estate any attorneys' fees and 
13 
co-executor's fees for services rendered to 
14 
the estate without prior approval of the 
15 
Court." 
16 
Is it my understanding that we 
17 
know that only applies to the firm 
18 
representing the estate and these proceedings 
19 
20 
have not --
THE COURT: That have always 
21 
been my understanding as a Practitioner in 
22 
Probate when I practiced probate law and the 
23 
time that I'm sitting on the bench because the 
24 
Court cannot--I would tie your hands if each 
25 
and every time you had to come before me to 

Frobate ST- 19-PB-0080 
39 
1 
ask, can this be done? 
You set forth here in 
2 
the motion for approval for Trotman and 
3 
Saun ers. 
4 
5 
Honor. 
6 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your 
THE COURT: I believe he was 
7 
retained during the decedent's lifetime. 
If I 
8 
understand the reading, the co-executors are 
9 
seeing to pa y for ser i 
t 
t were 
e 
re 
10 
to the decedent; am I correct? 
11 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: No, Your Honor. 
12 
THE COURT: Okay. 
13 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: I'm sorry. 
14 
THE COURT: Okay. Let me hear it. 
15 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: We did do that, 
16 
Your Honor. 
We did make payments for services 
17 
rendered during his lifetime. 
18 
THE COURT: Okay. 
19 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: The only thing 
20 
we've sought the Court's approval for is after 
21 
he died the services that were then retained 
22 
by the co-executors to represent the estate. 
23 
THE COURT: But for matters when he 
24 
was alive, he was facing, there was a 
25 
federal--

Probate ST-19-PB-008 0 
1 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Uhmm--well, 
2 
there was a--
3 
THE COURT: Listen here. 
Don't 
4 
say no. Let me get it. United States versus 
5 
Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Criminal 490 Southern 
6 
District of New York. This is the motion for 
7 
approval of payment of Steptoe and Johnson, 
8 
LLP, an Incorporated Memorandum of Law. 
9 
During his lifetime he retained the law firm 
10 
to provide necessary legal representation. 
11 
Upon decedent's death, the Federal criminal 
40 
12 
case proceeded until August 29th at 2019 and 
13 
Steptoe's representation discontinued shortly 
14 
15 
thereafter. 
So then I have a fee affidavit 
16 
for that, correct? 
17 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your 
18 
Honor. 
19 
THE COURT: So the decedent had 
20 
retained him in his lifetime to represent him. 
21 
He died. They continued representation. 
Now 
22 
they're seeking to be paid; am I correct as to 
23 
that? 
24 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: 
They're 
25 
seeking to be paid only for the post-death 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
fees incurred. The pre-death fees, the 
executors went ahead and paid. 
41 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
THE COURT: Right, but now for what 
they did to bring this matter to conclusion, 
correct? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Correct, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: I do not see that the 
9 
Probate Court--this is not the kind of fees 
10 
I'm reading that the Probate Court i s said 
11 
needed to come before the Probate Court for 
12 
approval. 
13 
So as it per~ains to the 
14 
motion for appr oval of Steptoe and Johnson, 
15 
Trotman and Saunders--and again, Trotman and 
16 
Saunders, then it was renewed with additional 
17 
fees, and it is my understanding that Trotman 
18 
Saunders, LLP, is representing the estate in 
19 
New York for these numerous cases that have 
20 
been filed by the alleged victims of sexual 
21 
assault, corr ect. 
22 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Correct, Your 
23 
Honor. 
24 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, if I 
25 
may just for clarification, I am not sure how 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
1 
the legal fees requested by these firms are 
2 
any different than creditors claim. 
42. 
3 
THE COURT: You know how they are 
4 
different? 
I'm going to tell you. 
They are 
5 
different pursuant to Title 15, Virgin Islands 
6 
Code, Section 568, "an executor or 
7 
administrator shall be allowed in the 
8 
settlement of his account all necessary 
9 
expenses incurred in the care, management and 
10 
settlement of the estate, including reasonable 
11 
attorneys fees and any necessary litigation or 
12 
matter requiring legal advice or Counsel. 
13 
When we appoint executors or any 
14 
person of fiduciary capacity, we want to make 
15 
sure that this person can complete his or her 
16 
fiduciary responsibilities to the Court~ 
The 
17 
person is given all rights to go and retain 
18 
Counsel because the Court says he is taking an 
19 
oath to protect the assets of the estate. 
20 
The fiduciary, the co-executor 
21 
goes out and retains Counsel to litigate, to 
22 
represent the estate - whether it's in an 
23 
automobile accident case, whether it's in a 
24 
mortgage foreclosure - wherever the estate is 
25 
now being sued, and the Court says by statute, 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
Virgin Islands law says the Legislature has 
2 
determined that executor is allowed the 
43 
3 
attorney fees in the necessary litigation and 
4 
where he needed the legal advice of Counsel. 
5 
Legal advice of Counsel was 
6 
needed, is needed in these ongoing matters 
7 
pending in New York. The executors, the 
8 
co-executors have retained Counsel to 
9 
represent the estate. 
I'm going to assume the 
10 
co- executors is going to retain Counsel to 
11 
represent the estate in the action the 
12 
Government is going to file against them. 
13 
What the probate Court reviews 
14 
is the expenses of probate administration, 
15 
part of which includes, whether it's paid to 
16 
estate counsel - in this instance, the firm of 
17 
Kellerhauls, right? 
18 
Before me I have a motion for 
19 
approval of Kellerhauls, Ferguson, Kroblin, 
20 
PLLC, Interim payment application Number 1 in 
21 
which they set out, which they are seeking 
22 
fees where they provided to the estate in the 
23 
administration of the probate estate from 
24 
August 11, 2019 to October 31st of 2019. They 
25 
are seeking for this Court to approve those 

Proba t e ST-1 9- PB- 00 8O 
1 
fees. Those are the fees that this Court has 
2 
before it where they are required to set out 
3 
the date, time, and service provided. 
4 
Now on review of these fees, 
44 
5 
which was provided to the Court by Order, they 
6 
had to submi 
to the Court . 
Upon my review of 
7 
these fees, I'm going to deny your motion for 
8 
approval of these fees. Number 1, this Court 
9 
does not enter interim orders for fees because 
10 
then it requires the Court to be keeping an 
11 
accounting system of what fees have been paid 
12 
or not paid. 
This is three months. August 
13 
11th to October 31st of 2019. 
14 
Also, in your fee affidavit, 
15 
Counsel is to provide date, time, service 
16 
provided. When I opened what is termed a 
17 
pre-bill, the bills are seriously redacted. 
18 
I, as the Officer charged with reviewing this 
19 
fee affidavit to determine if the fees are 
20 
reasonable, cannot determine what services 
21 
were provided by your law firm in the probate 
22 
administration. 
23 
Let's begin. September 23rd of 
24 
2019, attention to--redacted. Reviewed--
25 
redacted. 
What was reviewed? 
Legal research 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
45 
1 
2 
3 
and preparation of--redacted. 
Telephone 
conference with Co-Counsel reviewed--
redacted. There are numerous redactions. 
How 
4 
do I know was this work necessary for the 
5 
probate administration customary that the 
6 
Court would find needed for probate? 
You 
7 
don't provide the services provided. 
8 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: And Your 
9 
Honor, we would be happy to submit an 
10 
un-redacted version for in-camera review. The 
11 
reason it was redacted is because we believe 
12 
that it contained attorney-client privilege 
13 
information that we didn't believe was 
14 
appropriate to waive. 
15 
So Your Honor, we submitted it 
16 
in a redacted form and we were going to 
17 
request what the Court wanted, once we got 
18 
some guidance on how the Court wanted to 
19 
proceed on fee applications, to submit an 
20 
in-camera un-redacted version. 
21 
THE COURT: Even if I wanted to 
22 
approve this motion, I couldn't. I don't have 
23 
information. I don't know what you did on 
24 
behalf of the estate because it's struck out . 
25 
How is it that I don't understand 

Proba.te ST-19- PB- 0080 
46 
1 
attorney-client privilege, research on probate 
2 
procedures and you know what, that is your 
3 
decision. 
4 
You understand why I am not 
5 
goi ng to approve this motion for interim fees 
6 
a t this time by your law firm. 
7 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Your Honor, if 
8 
I may, I understand the Court's ruling and I 
9 
think we filed a motion for reconsideration on 
10 
the interim payment of fees. We believe i t has 
11 
been done in the past in states we've 
12 
represented. 
13 
THE COURT: I'm not saying it has 
14 
not been done. 
I said this Court does not 
15 
enter interim fee orders. Thi s Court does not 
16 
enter interim fee orders. 
17 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Okay, Your 
18 
Honor. We respectful l y will request to file a 
19 
motion brief consideration on that ruling, but 
20 
I understand your ruling. 
21 
THE COURT: You can do that. 
22 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you. 
23 
THE COURT: And I'm going to tell 
24 
you, doing this cursive review, I picked up 
25 
one page, November 14 of 2019, I see one 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
1 
attorney, 17 hours in one day. Right. 
2 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: 
Yes, Your 
3 
Honor. 
4 
THE COURT: You understand that 
5 
is the kind of-- now, that is what comes 
6 
before me and I can sit down and say I see 
7 
this probate file. I know what's required to 
8 
be filed and done in a probate. 
I have seen 
9 
the attorneys, and that is why it is the 
10 
probate fees that are reviewed by this Court 
11 
and I can l ook and say, well, what could an 
12 
attorney have done for 17 hours - just one 
13 
day, one attorney--this is August 16 of 2019 
14 
--for 17 hours? 
15 
That's why the Court reviews 
16 
the probate fees or the fees generated for 
17 
probate admini stration. So this motion for 
18 
approval for Kellerhauls is denied without 
19 
prejudice at this point in time. 
20 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you. 
21 
ATTORNEY SMI TH: Your Honor, one 
22 
of the concerns that we have with regard to 
23 
preserving the estate assets is the same 
24 
concern that the Court just raised. I 
25 
understand the Court's position pursuant to 
47 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
48 
1 
your reading of Virgin Islands law as to the 
2 
attorney fees outside of the probate petition 
3 
or the probate estate that would not require 
4 
consideration by this Court but to the extent 
5 
that even in this initial accounting, there 
6 
are literally no vouchers, nothing to 
7 
support --
8 
THE COURT: 
And I will bring 
9 
that up. 
I will bring that up when we get 
10 
there. 
I know they filed the quarterly 
11 
accounting --and I have a note that the 
12 
quarterly accounting is deficient. 
13 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Significantly 
14 
so, Your Honor. 
15 
THE COURT: 
And when 
16 
co-executors file deficient quarterly 
17 
accountings or are not doing their accounting 
18 
work as the Court 
requires, the Court has a 
19 
process in which the Court can remove the 
20 
co-executors or in some way impose a penalty 
21 
on the co-executors. The testator in his will 
22 
provided for these co-executors to be paid 
23 
executors fees. If the Court were to find the 
24 
co-executors dilatory in their duties, the 
25 
Court could reduce those fees or not award any 

Proba te ST-19-PB-0080 
49 
fees. 
1 
2 
So there are ways the Court can 
3 
deal with co-executors or administrators who 
4 
the Court does not believe is completing or 
5 
fulfilling their fiduciary duties, but we are 
6 
not at that point as yet. 
7 
Concerning the motions for 
8 
Trotman Saun ers and Steptoe Johnson , 
he 
9 
Court does not believe it needs to approve 
10 
those fees. Those attorneys are being hired to 
11 
represent the estate in the civil proceedings. 
12 
These matters are not before the Court. The 
13 
co-executors have been charged with their 
14 
fiduciary duties to preserve and protect the 
15 
estate and that means taking on litigation, 
16 
determining if they need to hire Counsel. 
17 
The only Counsel this Court 
18 
reviews the application of is probate Counsel 
19 
and then in your quarterly accounting 
20 
everything w·11 be set forth as to what is 
21 
being expended. Persons can raise objections. 
22 
Okay. Have we dealt with the fee Ap? 
23 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Understood. 
24 
THE COURT: Okay. Now what's left 
25 
before the Court--well, you know what? 
Let's 

Probat e ST- 19-PB-0080 
1 
deal with the quarterly accounting that was 
2 
filed because then based again on how I put 
3 
things in categories, the last category 
50 
4 
remaining will be this claims program, right? 
5 
Concerning the first quarterly 
6 
accounting that was fi l ed with the Court on 
7 
August 31st of 2020, Counsel, again, as the 
8 
Government have pointed out, the items l isted, 
9 
the need to be determined--it says, determine 
10 
by appraisal and this first quarterly 
11 
accounting covers August 10th of 2019 to 
12 
December 31st of 2019. Right? It's signed by 
13 
the co-executors. 
14 
This 1s the problem I had when 
15 
I reviewed it. 
Again, heavily redacted as to 
16 
the bank statements. Then you have copies of 
17 
checks I can't even read. 
18 
Attorney Blum, do you see the 
19 
First Bank, Voucher 1, First Bank. 
Attached 
20 
is a check redacted as to who received 
21 
$16,000. The text is so small, I cannot read 
22 
them. And pursuant to Rule 5, each expenditure 
23 
is to be supported by proper documentation. 
24 
For example, we have the funeral expenses, 
25 
correct? 

Probate ST- 19- PB-0080 
1 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Correct. 
2 
THE COURT: Let me get there. 
3 
Funeral expenses I guess this is to the home, 
4 
16,308, it doesn't say what entity. 
Usually 
5 
you would have then the supporting invoice. 
51 
6 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, to the 
7 
extent that the vouchers are insufficient, we 
8 
will be happy to re-submit. 
9 
THE COURT: Right. The 
10 
expenditures, specifically by that Rule 15, 
11 
provides every expenditure or other 
12 
disposition of assets must be supported by 
13 
proper documentation. So, right, Co-Executors 
14 
might have issued a check and then I see the 
15 
check redacted as to who the check may have 
16 
been made payable to you and no supporting 
17 
documentation as to why the checks are issued. 
18 
That is j ust one example. 
It's very hard for 
19 
the Court then to determine if these are 
20 
probate related or justi fiable expenditures by 
21 
the estate. 
And I think that is the 
22 
Government's objection, the objection the 
23 
Government has. 
24 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, we 
25 
believe when we prepared the vouchers that the 

Probate ST-19-eB-0080 
52 
1 
bank statements would be sufficient. 
2 
Obviously , the cancel .... d check are difficult 
o 
3 
read and probably --
4 
THE COURT: Okay, you agree with 
5 
me. I thought it was just me. 
6 
ATTORNEY BLUM: No, it's 
7 
difficult for me as well but we'd ask that we 
8 
do need to redact account numbers which I 
9 
assume is not an issue for the Court so long 
10 
as it provides proper--
11 
THE COURT: Well, you know what--
12 
ATTORNEY BLUM: --detail as--
13 
THE COURT: I'm going tell you this 
14 
about--
15 
ATTORNEY BLUM: --to the payees. 
16 
THE COURT: Sorry, not to 
17 
18 
over-speak you. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: 
It's all right. 
19 
THE COURT: At some point you are 
20 
going to need to provide those account numbers 
21 
because of the final adjudication. 
That is 
22 
what we are adjudicatin , if these accounts 
23 
are still in existence. 
24 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We will do so to 
25 
that extent, at the end. 

1 
2 
3 
fine. 
Probate ST-1 9- PB- 0080 
53 
THE COURT: To the end, t hat's 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We are just 
4 
concerned about security with respect to this 
5 
particular decedent. 
6 
THE COURT: That's fine. 
I mean 
7 
the only payee I can read here is the 
8 
Government of the Virgin Isl ands on these 
9 
checks. 
That is the only payee I can see 
10 
there. I can follow the electronic fund 
11 
transfers, say, I guess, to Verizon, ADT, and 
12 
I guess may be just saying there's ongoing 
13 
with Verizon, whatever is needed for that, but 
14 
some of these others, I can't even see the 
15 
amount. 
16 
So as far as this Court's 
17 
quarterly accounting, when would you be able 
18 
to provide an appraisal as to the personal 
19 
property listed? 
20 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We are still in 
21 
the 
process, Your Honor, of hiring 
22 
appraisers. There are a lot of very valuable 
23 
assets in this estate and personal property 
24 
that was owned by the decedent or his 
25 
companies. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
54 
1 
Based on Your Honor's ruling 
2 
earlier, we will re-evaluate to the extent to 
3 
which any of the personal property may have 
4 
been owned by an entity, but to the extent 
5 
that they were owned by the decedent, we are 
6 
dealing with some valuable antiques and 
7 
valuable jewelry and a lot of assets in a lot 
8 
of places that we have located, but we still 
9 
are having to employ appropriate appraisers to 
10 
take care of that. We are in the process and 
11 
we will continue to do so. 
12 
THE COURT: Attorney Smith. 
13 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 
14 
Ariel Smith on behalf of the Government of the 
15 
Virgin Islands. In addition to the concerns 
16 
that have been previously raised with regard 
17 
to the lack of vouchers supporting the checks, 
18 
I'd like to draw the Court's attention to, in 
19 
particular, the page that states--let me see 
20 
if I can get it correct here--Your Honor, it 
21 
says, statement of decreases 
due to sales, 
22 
liquidation and payment of expenses. 
23 
THE COURT: What page? 
24 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It would be --
25 
when you look for the one that says Schedule 

?roba t e ST-19- PB-0080 
55 
1 
D, it purports to be, I guess an indication of 
2 
expenses. 
After you go to Schedule D, you go 
3 
to the third page in. The pages are not 
4 
numbered so it's difficult for us. 
5 
THE COURT: Yes, it's very 
6 
difficult. 
Guide me again. 
7 
Attorney Blum, are you there? 
8 
I have the Certificate of 
9 
Service. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: The 
10 
Schedule C which is a statement of income 
11 
collected. 
12 
THE COURT: Yes. 
13 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
The next 
14 
page after that was to be Schedule D. 
15 
THE COURT: 
Statement of 
16 
decreases due to sales, liquidation and 
17 
payment of expenses. Okay. 
18 
ATTORNEY SMITH: If you go to the 
19 
third page in of that, so that first page is 
20 
Schedule D and the second page and then you 
21 
get to the third page. 
22 
THE COURT: Yes. 
23 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And this, of 
24 
course, Your Honor, we have not had an 
25 
opportunity since we literally received this 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
56 
1 
by mail yesterday afternoon at 5 0' clock when 
2 
the other parties who are apart of the case 
3 
received theirs by email earlier that day, so 
4 
we did not even get the courtesy of a hand 
5 
delivery or an e-mail, but notwithstanding 
6 
that, in looking at that, you see two expenses 
7 
- one for twelve million dollars to Southern 
8 
Country International Limited; another one for 
9 
3.5 million to Southern Country International 
10 
Limited. 
From what I understand, these are 
11 
not attorneys so I'm not sure why they would 
12 
be getting checks that total fifteen million 
13 
five hundred dollars. 
14 
There's no explanation for it 
15 
with regard to Schedule F which is a couple of 
16 
pages later and again, Your Honor, this is 
17 
just a very quick review, we see there's a 
18 
statement of creditors claims that they say 
19 
have been presented, allowed and paid. 
20 
Now deferring to the Court's 
21 
interpretation of 15 VIC 560 that relates to 
22 
attorneys fees I would want to know what would 
23 
be the authority for the executors to pay what 
24 
they have even classified as creditors claims 
25 
without the authority of this Court. 

1

3 
Claims--
Probate ST-19-FB-0080 
THE COURT: The V.I. Statute. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, I 
4 
understand that--
57 
5 
THE COURT: You asked a question. 
6 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Right. 
7 
THE COURT: Claims presented to 
8 
the executors are examined and if approved are 
9 
paid by the co-executor. 
If rejected, then 
10 
they come before the Court. 
11 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your 
12 
Honor,but I see three of these, 
a number of 
13 
these claims are debt claims but there is a 
14 
specific claim which is to the Epstein Virgin 
15 
Islands Foundation 
doing business as Enhanced 
16 
Education, where is the invoice or whatever to 
17 
support that? 
18 
THE COURT: That is why I think I 
19 
just talked to Attorney Blum and he indicated 
20 
that he will provide the documentation. Just 
21 
like you, I got this first quarterly 
22 
accounting yesterday. Just like you, I picked 
23 
it up and said, it does not provide the 
24 
information necessary for the Court to 
25 
determine if these expenditures are proper 

PrQbate ST- 19- PB- 0080 
1 
expenditures. 
2 
I told Attorney Blum the rules 
3 
require the documentation to be attached. So 
4 
now he knows. 
He has to amend, this first 
5 
quarterly accounting needs to be amended to 
58 
6 
provide the documentation to explain what has 
7 
been paid. 
And that is all I can do at this 
8 
point. 
9 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I understand 
10 
that, Your Honor. 
I am just concerned about 
11 
what woul d appear to be a course of conduct. 
12 
That's all I would just say t o that matter. 
13 
THE COURT: Okay and now you are 
14 
going to be copied on all the quarterly 
15 
accounti ngs. The Government has now fi l ed its 
16 
Cr iminal Activity Lien Noti ce, I believe, on 
17 
t he estate. 
So the estate now knows this 
18 
affects everything going forward. 
Attorney 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Bl um. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Just to 
re-conf irm, Your Honor , we will amend the 
accounting and to the extent that there are 
issues, what we would suggest t o t he Court is 
that we could have a separate hearing with 
respect to approval of the accounting if i t 's 

Pr obate ST-19-PS- 0080 
59 
necessary. 
1 
2 
3 
THE COURT: 
Well, the accounting 
is not approved as yet. 
You just continue to 
4 
submit your accounting but you need to have--
5 
Attorney Smith is correct, twelve million 
6 
dollars. 
I rnean-- you know what? 
Given the 
7 
size of this estate maybe that's not 
8 
significant. It's still twelve million 
9 
dollars to Southern Country International 
10 
Limited with no information. 
11 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And the short 
12 
explanation, Your Honor, is there was a 
13 
mistake in deposit that was made and this was 
14 
15 
the reimbursement of that. 
THE COURT: Reimbursement? 
So 
16 
this money came back? 
17 
ATTORNEY BLUM: It came back, 
18 
yes. I mean, you can see --
19 
THE COURT: Where? 
20 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Right in the same 
21 
spot you were looking at. 
22 
THE COURT: 
A check? You know 
23 
what? 
24 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Two point six came 
25 
in and 11 came in, and 12 came out and -- -

Probate ST- 19-?B-0080 
60 
1 
THE COURT: You are right and then 
2 
it became, it's less. 
3 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes and that was 
4 
one point eight. 
5 
THE COURT: 
But you see 
6 
ATTORNEY BLUM: You need more 
7 
information, Your Honor. 
We understand. 
8 
THE COURT: 
If the documents were 
9 
attached, it would have explained it. 
You 
10 
are right, following this, it went in and came 
11 
back . 
12 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Right. 
It was 
13 
because of a mistake as to where the monies 
14 
went and that is why it was corrected. 
Your 
15 
Honor, we'll provide that detail with the 
16 
amended quarterly accountings. 
17 
THE COURT: Because it's required. 
18 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Of course. 
19 
THE COURT: It is required. 
By the 
20 
probate rules, it's required. 
21 
Anything else concerning the 
22 
quarterly accounting and all quarterly 
23 
accountings going forward. 
24 
ATTORNEY SMITH~ Your Honor, I 
25 
would just ask -- Ariel Smith, Government of 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
1 
the Virgin Islands. I would just ask that we 
2 
be able to brief the issues as they come up 
3 
because, again, we have not had a real 
4 
opportunity to do more than a cursory review 
5 
of it and we'd like to be able to do that so 
6 
any concerns that we have with regard to the 
7 
first accounting which the Court has not 
8 
approved, we'd like an opportunity --
9 
THE COURT: We don't approve the 
61 
10 
accounting. The attorney has said he is going 
11 
to--and you raised concern -- he is going to 
12 
amend his quarterly accounting. 
13 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, could 
14 
you inquire as to when we would be able to 
15 
expect that? 
16 
THE COURT: He is going to amend 
17 
his quarterly accounting and timely file it as 
18 
he is required to file quarterly accountings 
19 
every three months. 
20 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, no. I 
21 
understand that, Your Honor, but to the extent 
22 
that the first accounting had some issues, is 
23 
it going to be amended in a short period of 
24 
time before the second accounting or is it 
25 
going to be simply amended in the second 

Probate S'l'-19-PB-0080 
1 
accounting? 
I think we would want to have 
2 
some clarification on that. 
3 
THE COURT: Attorney Blum. 
4 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Well, the latest 
5 
would be by the second quarterly accounting. 
6 
THE COURT: 
That's what I'm 
62 
7 
saying, quarterly accountings from the date of 
8 
the appointment every three months thereafter. 
9 
ATTORNEY BLUM: 
Well, to keep it 
10 
straight, we'll amend this one and file the 
11 
next one and if we can file the amended 
12 
13 
14 
version of this sooner than the second one, we 
shall. 
THE COURT: 
You know, Attorney 
15 
Smith. 
16 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 
17 
THE COURT: 
Probate may be 
18 
different than other matters that you have 
19 
bee 
involved with. 
Okay . You have ogive 
20 
the time for the co-executors to gather the 
21 
information to attach it. Now through Counsel, 
22 
the co-executors are aware of what's required. 
23 
If they were not aware before, they are now 
24 
aware of how to file a quarterly accounting 
25 
and what documentations need to be attached. 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
63 
1 
Right. Rule 15. 
2 
And the consequences of failing 
3 
to file your quarterly accountings as set out 
4 
in Rule 16, in which I explained, they can be 
5 
brought before the Court on a show cause, 
6 
Attorney Smith, and you can move for this 
7 
Court to cause them to come before the Court 
8 
to show cause if any, why they should not be 
9 
punished for contempt of Court. That is always 
10 
an option. 
11 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Thank you, Your 
12 
13 
Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. The 
14 
claims that have been filed, the Voluntary 
15 
Claims Resoluti on Program and the Criminal 
16 
Activity Lien notice filed by the Government. 
17 
Attorney Blum. 
18 
ATTORNEY BLUM: I would like to 
19 
call on attorney Andrew Tomback to address the 
20 
Court 
and present testimony with respect to 
21 
the Voluntary Claims Program, if it please 
22 
Your Honor. 
23 
THE COURT: 
But, you know what? 
24 
I don't mean --and I see Attorney Smith, I 
25 
understand that Voluntary Claims Resolution 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
64 
1 
Program is what i s being proposed by the 
2 
estate to address these claims that are going 
3 
to be filed in multiple jurisdictions, 
4 
numerous of them pending in New York, right? 
5 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Correct. Most of 
6 
them. 
7 
8 
9 
THE COURT: Most of them in New 
York. 
There's also in Florida. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And Minnesota. 
'10 
THE COURT: And Minnesota, right. 
11 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And we expect more. 
12 
THE COURT: And we expect more. 
13 
Let me summarize it --and 
14 
everyone listen and if anybody has an 
15 
objection to what I am going to say, then you 
16 
can raise it . 
17 
How I read, 
all the persons who 
18 
have filed claims through Counsel present here 
19 
in this courtroom, they have, the claimants 
20 
have no objection t o the Voluntary Claims 
21 
Resolution Program. Their concern is how much 
22 
money is to be expended to set up this 
23 
program. 
24 
I think it was Attorney Benham--
25 
is he still here? Do you see him in the 

Probate ST-19-ea-ooeo 
65 
1 
courtroom-- who raised those concerns and said 
2 
what are you going to do with the expenditures 
3 
for rents , paying salaries, just the cost of 
4 
setting it up. 
That was his concern, am I 
5 
correct, Attorney Benham? 
6 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: Yes,Your Honor. 
7 
Can I approach? 
8 
THE COURT: Yes. 
Well, you know 
9 
what, cause I'm just doing a summary and I 
10 
just wanted you to confirm and then I can let 
11 
you approach to supplement. 
12 
Who opposed the claims program 
13 
is the Government. 
14 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Right. 
15 
THE COURT: Because the 
16 
Government, Attorney Smith, listen and see if 
17 
I'm correct-- because the People have filed 
18 
this Criminal Activity Lien Notice, and this 
19 
lien notice is against the Estate of Jeffrey 
20 
E. Epstein ; Jeffrey Epstein; the 1953 Trust; 
21 
Plan D, LLC; Great St. James, LLC; Nautilus, 
22 
Inc. ; Hyperion Air, LLC; and Poplar, Inc . 
23 
And reading what's under the 
24 
Statute, the Statute provides that on the 
25 
filing of this lien, this is Title 14, Virgin 

Proba t e ST-19-PB- 0080 
1 
Islands Code, Section 610 "This lien shall 
2 
commence and attach as of the time of the 
66 
3 
filing with the Criminal Activity Lien Notice 
4 
and shall continue thereafter until 
S 
expiration, termination or release. The lien 
6 
created in favor of the Government of the 
7 
territory of the Virgin Islands shall be 
8 
superior to and prior to the interest of any 
9 
other persons in the personal or real property 
10 
or beneficial interest in, if the interest is 
11 
acquired subsequent to the filing of the 
12 
13 
notice. " 
So that all being said, with The 
14 
People having filed their Criminal Activity 
15 
Lien, hasn't it put everything on hold? 
.16 
ATTORNEY BLUM: It should not, Your 
17 
Honor. 
18 
19 
THE COURT: 
Tell me why not. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: The reason is that 
20 
the probate code itself, which is not 
21 
addressed in the Government's papers, state 
22 
very clearly --and I can find the cite for you 
23 
if you need it --
24 
THE COURT: Yes. 
25 
ATTORNEY BLUM: --that the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
67 
1 
administration expenses of the estate have 
2 
priority, virtually priority over everything 
3 
else the estate needs to be administered. 
The 
4 
problem that the executors will have is these 
5 
liens are in fact defective which we believe 
6 
they should not be and we will be asking Your 
7 
Honor to either dismiss them or we will do so 
8 
before Judge Dunston in the other matter under 
9 
which they've filed the Complaint. 
10 
With out that, we question 
11 
whether we can expend anything. We believe 
12 
that that is not correct under Virgin Islands 
13 
probate Code and that it is Your Honor who 
14 
controls in every respect the co-executors 
15 
actions with respect to what they expend and 
16 
what they don't expend and what they can not 
17 
expend and that is the point that we will make 
18 
in papers when we file them with respect to 
19 
those liens. 
20 
THE COURT: Because now there's a 
21 
question because I have here--
I know you're 
22 
pointing to Title 15, Virgin Islands Code, 
23 
Section 421, preference in payments of claims 
24 
and charges. Is that what you are talking 
25 
about? 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
68 
1 
ATTORNEY BLUM: That is correct. 
· 2 
THE COURT: In administration, 
3 
funeral charges, taxes, expenses, debts 
4 
preferred by law, debts which is the debt of 
5 
the deceased were a lien upon his property of 
6 
any rights or interest,debts to employees, all 
7 
other claim against the estate. 
8 
Where would this lien, this 
9 
Criminal Activity Lien fall, because they, by 
10 
the statute, 14 VIC 610, if I'm reading it, 
11 
everything has been locked down. 
12 
ATTORNEY BLUM: That was our first 
13 
reading as well, Your Honor. 
14 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
15 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And ' that is our 
16 
concern with respect to that. 
17 
THE COURT: 
Except may be for the 
18 
basic administration of the estate but as far 
19 
as it goes to settling claims because if that 
20 
is-- okay, the estate can continue to 
21 
function. 
22 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Thank you. 
23 
THE COURT: 
I have no problems 
24 
with that. If the estate has to pay 
25 
taxes--Attorney Smith, the estate has to pay 

Pl:Ob a te s ·r -1 9-PB-0 080 
69 
1 
taxes, it pays its taxes, right? 
2 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That is correct, 
3 
Your Honor. 
4 
5 
6 
employees. 
THE COURT: 
If the estate has to--
ATTORNEY SMITH: Pay its 
7 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Pay its 
8 
employees; if the estate has to pay its 
9 
attorneys, other than estate Counsel, because 
10 
the estate now has attorneys who have to come 
11 
in and represent him in this matter --Now, 
12 
this civil--
I know --
13 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I'm not happy 
14 
about that. 
11 
15 
THE COURT: 
I know you a r e not 
16 
happy with that civil forfeiture matter-- but 
17 
what i t seems to me that the estate cannot do, 
18 
the estate cannot pay claims, cannot pay these 
19 
claims that have been filed by the persons 
20 
that may be coming out of New York-- whether 
21 
they get a judgment out of New York or whether 
22 
they come in to this Claims Resolution 
23 
Program-- that is how I'm reading that, that 
24 
by this the Government has said, stop because 
25 
and I read that in part of your f iling because 
II 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
70 
1 
the Government is concerned that you could 
2 
then start this program, start entering 
3 
settlements, paying out settlements and then 
4 
when the Government comes, there's nothing at 
5 
all. 
6 
ATTORNEY BLUM: The program will be 
7 
recommending settlement. It will be approving 
8 
settlements that will be paid by the estate. 
9 
They will need to be paid if, in fact, we 
10 
adopt the program. The problem is that if we 
11 
do not proceed to the program, it will tend to 
12 
waste estate assets because, as Attorney 
13 
Kroblin refered to earlier, we wil l now have 
14 
to go much heavier into litigation that are 
15 
already pending. We will need to expend 
16 
additional expenses on attorneys fees and 
17 
other expenses relating to those litigations 
18 
especially with respect to discovery since 
19 
there's at least 22 of them that will be a 
2 0 
very large amount. 
21 
Since at least the claimants who 
22 
have spoken up, appear to be in favor of the 
23 
program, that is why we would like to get the 
24 
program approved quickly, as soon as Your 
25 
Honor is prepared to do so. 
And then we still 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
71 
1 
have to deal with the liens. That is a 
2 
separate issue . 
I t might prevent the actual 
3 
payment but if we can promptly deal with the 
4 
liens even after we have started the program, 
5 
that would be to the estate's advantage 
6 
because we would not have this additional 
7 
litigation expense, and once we get to the 
8 
point of actually having to pay out the 
9 
settlements via the program or otherwise, 
10 
other settlements, that would be the way we 
11 
think that we should be proceeding. 
12 
THE COURT: 
You see, Attorney 
13 
Blum, how you described it, that was my 
14 
thought process. 
That if you have the 
15 
settlement resolution program quickly, I mean 
16 
fairly quickly dealt with, because if not, if 
17 
you don't use that 
program, then what you 
18 
have is these multiple lawsuits proceeding, 
19 
attorneys being retained to represent the 
20 
estate in these actions and judgments being 
21 
entered but you have no control of and the 
22 
judgment will have to be paid whether it's a 
23 
settlement through this program or a judgment. 
24 
But my question is right now by 
25 
what The People have filed and you said that

19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Probat e ST-19-eB-0080 
was your initial reading of it, what has 
changed? 
72 
ATTORNEY BLUM: My initial concern, 
I'm concerned--
THE COURT: Well, that is my 
concern too. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: 
--that this Court 
and the Government feel that we shouldn't be 
spending anything on virtually anything. 
You 
have already confirmed that we can administer 
the estate for which we appreciate that, but 
part of the administration of the estate is 
also dealing with these claims. 
THE COURT: Yes, I know but now 
these claims are going to be paid from where? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: They are going to 
be paid from estate assets, no doubt. 
THE COURT: 
And The People have 
just put a lien and the lien provides that 
nothing could be paid out of those assets. 
I can understand that you need 
to do it today and I think Attorney Smith 
understand that but their concern is that you 
cannot pay claims and you cannot set up this 
program. 

P~obate ST-19-PB-008O 
73 
1 
Attorney Smith, then what would 
2 
you have the estate do? 
Then the estate is 
3 
going to go into New York and Minnesota and 
4 
Florida and wherever else and having to retain 
5 
Counsel for all these lawsuits. 
6 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And Your Honor. 
7 
THE COURT: Yes. 
8 
ATTORNEY BLUM: These claimants 
9 
will be denied timely compensation which is 
10 
one of the things that the co- executors very 
11 
much wish to avoid. We wish to compensate them 
12 
promptly. They were interested in having this 
13 
program go forward and that is what we would 
14 
like to do. 
15 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, 
16 
first of all, the program and I mean-- let me 
17 
go back. Let me go to the podium, Your Honor. 
18 
Ariel Smith on behalf of the 
19 
Government of the Virgin Islands. I think 
20 
Virgin Islands law is clear as to what the 
21 
Criminal Activity Lien is. I don't think from 
22 
my estimation there's any dispute but beyond 
23 
that, I think that there's a misunderstanding 
24 
as to what the Government is saying. 
25 
Besides the Criminal Activity 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
1 
Lien Notice, we have stated an opposition to 
2 
the plan as proposed and what we did in our 
74 
3 
opposition is we indicated the areas in which 
4 
we have concerns about the plan as proposed. 
5 
One of the areas that we were concerned with 
6 
is that the plan as proposed, presumes to 
7 
exonerate other people besides the estate of 
8 
Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
9 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, we 
10 
haven't had a chance to present our motions 
11 
yet and she is providing all--
12 
THE COURT: You know what? Yes. 
13 
And I have no idea what you are speaking of. 
14 
You know what? 
Attorney Smith, 
15 
if I could, the estate was going to provide 
16 
the Court with more information concerning 
17 
this plan this morning. 
18 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay, and to 
19 
that end, whatever is provided this morning, 
20 
we have no information as to it and the 
21 
information that was provided in the 
22 
opposition we received yesterday, we have not 
23 
had an opportunity to reply to it because we 
24 
just saw it, so it might be premature. 
25 
And finally--and this is the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
75 
1 
last thing I'm going to say with regard to 
2 
this until I'm called again -- but we believe 
3 
that setting up this plan without the Court 
4 
having a full inventory and a complete 
5 
accounting that has vouchers and all the other 
6 
deficiencies that were missing from this 
7 
accounting would be premature. 
8 
THE COURT: Okay. So let the 
9 
Court say this: 
I'm not going to make any 
10 
decision on this plan, whether creating this 
11 
plan or it shouldn't be created or should be 
12 
put in place this morning because I have no 
13 
information as to the plan because in the 
14 
submissions from the estate, they set forth, I 
15 
think several times that full information will 
16 
be brought to the Court this morning. 
17 
I'm going to allow you then to 
18 
pro ide tha 
informa ion . 
Then Im going 
o 
19 
allow Counsel present to make their comments, 
20 
arguments, for or against the plan but there 
21 
is going to be no decision this morning 
22 
because I do not have full information as to 
23 
this plan. 
24 
Then, I'm going to have to say 
25 
if this Court were to structure, set up, allow 

P~oba t e ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
--first of all, do I even need to be the one 
2 
to allow the co-executors to establish the 
76 
3 
plan, moving estate assets, and if that's the 
4 
way, I need to know how much estate assets are 
5 
you going to move; how does that import with 
6 
the Criminal Activity Lien Notice that the 
7 
People have filed; is there anyway for me to 
8 
get around it; can the two sides, with the 
9 
People work that out and say so much can go 
10 
into the plan? 
Yes, we don't want to affect 
11 
claimants but we also have to know we have a 
12 
claim; The People have filed their claim. 
13 
And you know, for none of 
14 
the claimants before this Court do I have 
15 
numbers; right. 
There are no numbers so I 
16 
can't even say set aside this amount. There 
17 
are no numbers. Everything is, you know, 
18 
speculation, a judgment, we're going into 
19 
court but there are no numbers which is 
20 
unusual because when claims come before the 
21 
Court, a claim by the Statute, that is how we 
22 
determine claims. It sets out the specific 
23 
amounts. 
24 
ATTORNEY BLUM: If we might at 
25 
this time, I would like Attorney Tomback to 

Probat.e ST-19-E'B-00B·0 
77 
1 
provide the Court, via witnesses, with much of 
2 
the information that you are inquiring about 
3 
and that the Government is inquiring about and 
4 
at the end of that presentation, then Your 
5 
Honor can ask whatever questions. 
6 
THE COURT: Testimony? Are you 
7 
going to have written documents? 
8 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That i s my 
9 
concern al so. 
10 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes. 
11 
THE COURT: I thought it to be 
12 
written documents with how much is going to be 
13 
expended for rents, money - not testimony. 
14 
ATTORNEY BLUM: It would be both, 
15 
Your Honor. 
16 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I 
17 
think this is part of the Government's concern 
18 
and this is Ariel Smith again for the record. 
19 
The Estate needs to be 
20 
forthright with the Court about every aspect 
21 
of whatever i t is they are proposing even 
22 
though again we maintain it's premature 
23 
because if they haven't at this juncture 
24 
they are making this plan proposal but they 
25 
haven't even done the basics which is to give 

Probate ST-19-PB-0O80 
1 
the Court an inventory and based on its 
2 
motion, they have until March 2nd 
78 
3 
approximately, to provide this inventory so to 
4 
even get into a plan without an inventory so 
5 
the Court knows, essentially the lay of the 
6 
land, is extremely premature and then to 
7 
proposed the plan before the Court without 
8 
any writings, without any opportunity to vet 
9 
it properly, it's highly irregular. 
10 
THE COURT: 
If I understand it, 
11 
Attorney Tomback is going to provide the Court 
12 
with how much he believes, how much the plan 
13 
would cost. 
Am I correct? 
14 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
15 
Andrew Tomback on behalf of the executors. 
I 
16 
have been admitted pro hac vice. I know I can 
17 
do this later but my oath is here if Your 
18 
Honor wants it. 
19 
THE COURT: Yes. Please file it 
20 
21 
in the proper way into the Court. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: It's our 
22 
intent to have Your Honor's permission to call 
23 
three witnesses. 
The first witness, Jordana 
24 
Feldman, and they all will be supported by 
25 
documents, documents which have been available 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
79 
1 
in the public domain, some of which have been 
2 
filed by the Court and available to the 
3 
Attorney General, that describes the program 
4 
in great detail. 
·s 
The reason for the program; why 
6 
it makes sense to the victims; why it makes 
7 
sense, I think, for everybody in terms of the 
8 
estate not to be litigating in various places 
9 
and spending money on litigation. 
10 
Quite frankly, I think that if 
11 
the Attorney General hears from these 
12 
witnesses, I can tell you about it in a 
13 
moment, but if the Attorney General hears from 
14 
these witnesses, I believe that we'll address 
15 
every concern that the Attorney General has 
16 
raised, including whether i n fact we can pick 
17 
a particular number as a number of dollars 
18 
that Your Honor at this time, Your Honor can 
19 
say, okay, that is the right number because we 
20 
don't have the whole number of victims and so 
21 
forth, and I would defer, quite frankly I'm 
22 
just a lawyer, but the people I'm going to 
23 
call, Jordana Feldman who was the 
24 
Administrator of the 911 fund has tremendous 
25 
experience. This is the first witness we would 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
80 
1 
like to call with respect to that, Your Honor. 
2 
The second witness is Ken 
3 
Feinberg. Mr. Feinberg from the beginning of 
4 
his career involving Agent Orange and working 
5 
with the Judge in the United States to solve 
6 
what seemed to be an intractable problem, has 
7 
done plans like this more than any person 
8 
alive - not just in the United States but 
9 
anywhere. 
10 
And then the third wi tness is my 
11 
colleague, Mr. Weiner, who also represents the 
12 
estate who would briefly testify regarding why 
13 
the estate itself is going to be harmed (a) if 
14 
the Attorney General lien, as you put it, 
15 
makes everything grind to a halt, not only the 
16 
victims or the alleged victims or the 
17 
claimants - whatever you want to call them, 
18 
but also the estate. 
19 
I'd just like the opportunity to 
20 
put them forward. I think it will clarify a 
21 
great 
eal for Your Honor, the A torney 
22 
General. 
I think in fairness to the people 
23 
and the Court who don't have an opportunity to 
24 
speak because they are not admitted to hear 
25 
how we be l ieve this wil l help people who 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
1 
alleged that they've been harmed, people who 
2 
are claimants. 
3 
THE COURT: But there is still 
81 
4 
the concern. 
If I understand it, the People 
5 
are the only ones opposing the establishment 
6 
of this program, right, as proposed but there 
7 
is nothing proposed. 
8 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
9 
we can bridge the enormous gap because the 
10 
Attorney General's understanding and 
11 
expression in our papers of what is proposed 
12 
is not what is proposed and I think if we hear 
13 
from the witnesses, we'll understand from the 
14 
witnesses what is really proposed and I think 
15 
the Attorney General can have every 
16 
opportunity to cross examine them. 
17 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, but 
18 
we are not prepared to do that today, Number 
19 
1. 
20 
THE COURT: 
You know, that is 
21 
true. 
You told me, because I did not know 
22 
that you were going to have all these people 
23 
here. 
24 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And so we are 
25 
not prepared to do that today because we 

1

6

8

23 
24 
25 
11 
Proba t e ST-19-PB-0080 
82 
haven't had an opportunity to vet this 
question, but more importantly, we still 
haven't found out from the executor what does 
this program cost. Do you have those numbers? 
That is the preliminary question. We can hear 
all about, you know, all the touchy-feeley, 
whatever. 
THE COURT: Okay, Attorney Smith. 
Let's hear from some of the other attorney 
representing. 
Attorney Benham, do you want to 
come forward or any other attorney wishing to 
speak in this matter? 
Just identify yourself. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: By the way, 
Your Honor, I just want to make one thing 
clear just so Your Honor understands. 
I think 
Your Honor knows this but we 1 re here now and I 
understand your concerns but speed is of the 
essence. 
I think that the victims or the 
claimant's counsel will speak to that. 
But we made our motion with 
respect to that, Your Honor, on November 14th. 
We then filed again on December 13th. The 
Attorney General i s late to the game, right, 
so she says she's not prepared but she wants 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
83 
to stop us. 
1 
2 
THE COURT: But listen, you filed 
3 
your motion to establish the program, right, 
4 
without--
5 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: That is all we 
6 
want to do now, Your Honor. 
7 
THE COURT: Yes, but you want me 
8 
just carte blanche go and establish the 
9 
program? 
You never gave the Court any 
10 
numbers. We didn't know what numbers we were 
11 
dealing with. We didn't have a quarterly 
12 
accounting. We didn't have an inventory. 
13 
That's part of the objections the People are 
14 
making and now--
15 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your--
16 
THE COURT: --let me finish--so 
17 
don't tell me cause you told me when you filed 
18 
your motion. I know when you filed your motion 
19 
but I was not prepared to rule because there 
20 
was no information for this Court to rule on 
21 
that motion. 
So now if I understand it and 
22 
then motions or filing to the Court during the 
23 
course of the week said the Court will be 
24 
given this information at the hearing. 
Well, 
25 
I didn't know what kind of information you 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
84 
1 
were coming with at the hearing. 
Now you say 
2 
you are coming with witnesses. My thing and I 
3 
specifically said Attorney Benham made one of 
4 
the most salient arguments --no objections to 
5 
the plan but what is the cost of the plan. 
6 
Everybody just want to know what you are going 
7 
to do to set this up. And that is what I want 
8 
to hear. 
Let me hear from other counsel, 
9 
please, sir. 
10 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Sure. 
11 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: Good morning, 
12 
Your Honor. Sean Foster. 
Our firm represents 
13 
probably two dozen of the victims - probably 
14 
the majority of the victims that are going to 
15 
be filing claims against the estate and we are 
16 
absolutely in favor of this program. 
We think 
17 
it's a great program that will provide redress 
18 
to the victims without the need for protracted 
19 
litigation and we feel that to derail that 
20 
process at this stage would not be in the best 
21 
interest of those victims. 
22 
We don't disagree that more 
23 
information is required and I think that 1 s why 
24 
we are here today - to get more information so 
25 
that we can move forward and support that 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
1 
program for our clients. That is where we 
2 
stand on that position, Your Honor. 
3 
THE COURT: Thank you, Attorney 
4 
5 
Foster. 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: You're welcome. 
6 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: Good morning, 
7 
Your Honor. Kevin D'Amour. We represent five 
8 
different victims. I would echo what Mr. 
9 
Foster just said but I want to make it clear 
85 
10 
that if we fail to establish a program that is 
11 
cognizant of the harm that's caused to these 
12 
victims it's going to be far more 
13 
discriminatory than what the Government is 
14 
trying to propose or object to. 
15 
I think if we go forward with 
16 
this program we are going to see great results 
17 
and I think we are going to have a much better 
18 
outcome if we can go forward with this program 
19 
as soon as possible. 
20 
THE COURT: Thank you. Attorney 
21 
22 
Benham. 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: Good morning, 
23 
Your Honor. John Benham on behalf of one 
24 
claimant, Jane Doe. 
I assume at some point 
25 
during our proceedings today we are going to 

) 

Probat e ST-19-eB-0080 
1 
get to the issue of how the creditors are 
2 
going to proceed in this by pseudonym or 
3 
however, but as far as the voluntary 
4 
compensation program, as we stated in our 
5 
papers that were filed on December 23rd, we 
6 
don't oppose the creation of the program but 
7 
we don't know what the program is. 
86 
8 
We don't know in particular, the 
9 
expenses that are going to be entailed in just 
10 
creating the program in the first place. We 
11 
don't know and we still don't know, even after 
12 
the first quarterly accounting, what is in the 
13 
estate, whether or not the program intends to 
14 
divulge making all of the estate assets 
15 
available. 
16 
I think the estate has responded 
17 
that yes, all of the assets, I believe they 
18 
have said that all of the assets are available 
19 
because under the terms of the will, the 
20 
executors have to pay all of the debts in all 
21 
of the claims that are approved and only after 
22 
that the rest and residue of the estate and 
23 
assets will be poured into the trust that was 
24 
created under the will. At least that is the 
25 
way I understood it. 

Probate ST - 1 9- PB- 0080 
87 
1 
THE COURT: Except f or now what 
2 
the Government has done. 
3 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: That is a new 
4 
development, Your Honor. 
5 
THE COURT: Yes. That is what I am 
6 
saying. That is what has now maybe thrown 
7 
everything and I got notice of this January 23 
8 
of 2020, right. That is a whole different 
9 
something to look at. What does that do to 
10 
what it may bring to the proceedings or 
11 
persons going under? 
12 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: I didn't get 
13 
notice of that until last Friday, Your Honor, 
14 
because the Government didn't serve anybody 
15 
except for the estate as far as I can tell so 
16 
as far as these proceedings, there's no- -
so 
17 
I'm not here to address whether or not the 
18 
CICO lien is as all encompassing as the 
19 
Government claims it is which basically 
20 
freezes every single asset of the estate and 
21 
say no, you can't pay anybody. I would 
22 
understand that is what they say the effec - of 
23 
the CICO lien is. 
24 
I would be, if the Court wishes 
25 
us and the other creditors who have filed 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
88 
1 
claims in this matter to address that, I would 
2 
suggest that perhaps a briefing schedule 
3 
should be established on that particular 
4 
issue. 
5 
THE COURT: I think that may be 
6 
appropriate and the People then could respond 
7 
because that is now the quandary I believe the 
8 
Court is in because now I have what maybe 
9 
going on in another court. 
I have the lien. 
10 
There's nothing else but it tells me a lien 
11 
against all and it lists specific assets and 
12 
it begins with the estate of Jeffrey E. 
13 
Epstein so if all these things, the shares in 
14 
all these corporations is sitting in that 
15 
estate, that is why I say does that then stop 
16 
everything. 
17 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor. 
18 
THE COURT: Let me hear from the 
19 
other Counsel. 
20 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I just wanted to 
21 
clarify one thing. 
The claims that are 
22 
represented here are the same kind of claims 
23 
that the Government has. Their claim is not 
24 
with regard to the lien itself1 but the nature 
25 
of the claims. 
It's the same exact type of 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
89 
1 
claim for those who are in New York courts or 
2 
other courts. 
So there's no distinction 
3 
between the claims that the Government has in 
4 
terms of the nature of the claims and claims 
5 
that are presented by these other claimants in 
6 
this case. 
7 
THE COURT: I don't know. 
I just 
8 
know people have filed claims; claims of 
9 
sexual assault, claims without any monies 
10 
attached to it indicating that they have filed 
11 
them in a Court of law and saying maybe they 
12 
can resolve them through this settlement 
13 
probate. 
14 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And also one of 
15 
those same type of --
16 
THE COURT: You're saying sexual 
17 
18 
trafficking. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, the point 
19 
I'm making, Your Honor, is that their claims 
20 
had no numbers nor do all claims and they are 
21 
all filed in court. 
22 
THE COURT: And I said that and 
23 
everybody has filed their claims here with no 
24 
numbers. 
25 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Right. 

Probate ST-1 9- PB-0080 
1 
THE COURT: So if I were to say 
2 
those are claims, those claims don't comport 
3 
with what the Statute requires but I'm 
4 
allowing people at some point to fix numbers 
90 
5 
on them, they're coming in as claims. 
If I'm 
6 
just sitting strictly on probate and just 
7 
reading what probate requires, it requires you 
8 
to have affixed a number. Nobody has affixed a 
9 
number but I can understand why you can't fix 
10 
a number cause you are just, to me, preserving 
11 
a claim that you say I may perfect somewhere 
12 
by getting, may get a judgment and then if I 
13 
don't or I don't want to try to get this 
14 
judgment, I'm willing to resolve this matter 
15 
through this voluntary settlement program. 
16 
Correct? 
Right. 
Everyone? 
17 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: Yes. I think 
18 
setting up the program is different than 
19 
paying out under the program. 
We want to move 
20 
forward with setting something up; we are not 
21 
talking about paying out. 
That is different~ 
22 
THE COURT: 
Attorney Foster, that 
23 
was one of the things and the note I have 1s 
24 
that's what it 1s. 
You just want to have this 
25 
program in place. 
You just want them to start 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
91 
1 
talking with the alleged victims and maybe 
2 
then you just have matters are settled, but 
3 
you still know I have to wait for whatever is 
4 
going to pan out here with this CICO lien. 
5 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: But I think 
6 
that program will also hel p flesh out what 
7 
those numbers are for each claimant cause each 
8 
claimant is very different. 
9 
THE COURT: Okay, Sir. 
Let me 
10 
hear from final Counsel. 
11 
ATTORNEY CHANCO: Douglas Chanco 
12 
here for the record. 
Your Honor, to build on 
13 
14 
15 
16 
Attorney Benham's argument 
adopt, this Court has kind 
concerns already so I will 
The setup of 
that I'd like to 
of touched on our 
be brief. 
the fund . not 
lS 
17 
what my claimant Araos's issue is. 
It's the 
18 
fact now that we've been hearing today of 32 
19 
plaintiff's lawsuit s and the funding of any 
20 
sort of claims program and we just--even with 
21 
the fact that Your Honor stressed, I have not 
22 
been able to provide a number as no other 
23 
claimant has, I would cite to the filing on 
24 
January 31st of this year in Schedule G. 
My 
25 
client's case is the first one listed on 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
92 
1 
Schedule G; it is a New York State case. It is 
2 
proceeding . It is not one that may possibly 
3 
be filed or is intended to be filed . It is 
4 
going forward at this time and her New York 
5 
Counsel 1s present here so we would just ask 
6 
the Court to, again, take concern as to 
7 
funding of any amount from the estate for the 
8 
payment claims at this point as we have a 
9 
valid claim to present and preserve at this 
10 
point. 
11 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: Your Honor, 
12 
may we be heard? 
13 
THE COURT: Yes . State your name 
14 
for the record, please. 
15 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: Melody 
16 
Westfall. Your Honor , we would ask that the 
17 
estate be allowed to resolve the claims Your 
18 
Honor ruled earlier today that the estate 
19 
would be allowed to settle some claims and we 
20 
would urge you to allow the --
21 
THE COURT: 
No, I don't recall 
22 
that. 
I said the estate could pay its 
23 
attorneys, except probate attorneys. 
24 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: 
Well, we 
25 
would argue that the lien applies after what 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
93 
1 
claims are paid . This is about the victims. 
2 
It's about the people's whose lives are ruined 
3 
and we are very in favor of the voluntary 
4 
program. The victims desperately need help . 
5 
It ' s pressing and we would urge the Court to 
6 
hear from the administrators and perhaps we 
7 
can resolve this today . 
Thank you, Your 
8 
Honor. 
9 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
10 
Have I heard from all the 
11 
attorneys representing persons who may be 
12 
fi l ing or have filed claims against the 
13 
estate? 
14 
ATTORNEY BOURNE-VANNECK: Good 
15 
morning, Your Honor . Richard Bourne- Vanneck on 
16 
behalf of the claimant Tela Davis. I would 
17 
second the issues that have been raised by 
18 
Attorney Benham . I thought he did it 
19 
adequately so that is why I sat back down. 
20 
Thank you. 
21 
THE COURT : Thank you. So if I 
22 
understand what the persons here , the 
23 
attorneys representing the claimant , what we 
24 
really just need to get is testimony on the 
2 5 
numbers. I think everybody says they' re in 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
94 
1 
favor of this program. 
They're satisfied how 
2 
the program may be set up . 
We just need to 
3 
know how much monies we are talking about that 
4 
would be allotted to this program. 
5 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I 
6 
would just state one thing. 
I really just 
7 
want an opportunity to present our own 
8 
witnesses. I think there's information that we 
9 
may have that I would like to present to the 
10 
Court also before the Court can make its final 
11 
decision. 
12 
THE COURT: 
I'm not making a 
13 
decision. 
I specifically said that. 
I'm 
14 
going to take the testimony because the 
15 
persons are here to testify. 
16 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay . 
17 
THE COURT: I think I specifically 
18 
said I'm not ruling on this and I'm also going 
19 
to require Counsel to brief the Court on the 
20 
effects of this lien as to anything how this 
21 
estate proceeds as far as it wants to set up 
22 
the claims. I understand that the estate just 
23 
want at this point permission to set up this 
24 
program . 
That is what I am understanding -
25 
permission to set up the program . 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
95 
1 
Then the question will be and 
2 
thereafter once the program is set up, you go 
3 
ahead and start to talk to the alleged 
4 
victims, would any settlement then have to 
5 
wait until resolution of this criminal 
6 
forfeiture in the civil action? 
7 
I'm going to ask Counsel to 
8 
brief the Court and provide to the Court say 
9 
within thirty days memorandums of law to 
10 
assist the Court on that but I'm going to 
11 
allow you to present-- I think everybody has 
12 
agreed that at this point they have enough 
13 
information as to what this program would 
14 
entail. 
15 
My law clerk, Attorney Harrigan 
16 
did some research on this program and he 
17 
provided to the Court that this similar 
18 
program has been done with 911 victims, the 
19 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles with i t s sexual 
20 
assault cases. 
21 
So it's not a program that has 
22 
not been used by other persons. It's just as, 
23 
I think, the estate has said, this may be a 
24 
new one in a probate but it has been done, 
25 
tried, tested, worked. I think we are just 

1 
2 
3 
4

6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12

20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Probat e ST- 1 9-PB-0080 
96 
here and all Counsel for claimants have said 
they support the program because they believe 
it will be a quick resolution for these 
victims, alleged victims, rather than having 
to go to court and testify, right, in open 
court and have to present a full claim. 
To me, it also has to reduce 
attorneys' fees on both sides significantly. 
Just how much will be set up maybe the Estate 
can work with the People as to what -- because 
it's the People, the Government is the 
opposition. 
That's where your opposition is. 
I have no other opposition but the Government 
and maybe their mistake is just try to work 
with the Government with regard to what the 
Government has filed. 
But Sir, just go 
ahead, please. I think we can just limit it to 
what the numbers are. Fair enough for everyone 
in the courtroom? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
with some leeway, I thi nk we can focus, okay? 
THE COURT: Okay. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: So Ms. 
Feldman, will you take the stand, please?

By Attorney Tornback:

Q. 
Please state your name for the 
3 
record? 
4 
A. 
It's Jordana Harris Feldman. 
S 
Q. 
Where do you live? 
6 
A. 
I live in --
7 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Sorry. Sorry. 
8 
I 'm sorry. She should be sworn. 
9 
THE COURT: 
Yes, she should be. 
10 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
She's 
11 
trustworthy, Your Honor. 
12 
THE COURT: Well, yes. 
13 
(Laughter) 
14 
And you do have your pro hac 
15 
admission? 
May I have it before I allow you, 
16 
let me just at least say I saw that. 
17 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: May I step 
18 
forward or--
19 
THE COURT: The marshal will take 
20 
it for you. 
97 
21 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Thank you, sir. 
22 
THE COURT: Let's take a 
23 
ten-minute recess. 
24 
{Ten-minute recess} 
25 
{Court re-convened} 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
1 
Good afternoon. 
Before we 
2 
proceed I need to take care of ,some matters. 
3 
After I retired to chambers, it came to my 
4 
attention, I think I have been free with the 
5 
Counsel for the claimants to allow them to 
6 
come forward and make presentations to the 
7 
Court because this is an unusual situation 
8 
here this morning. But before me I have a 
9 
motion from the People, the Government to 
10 
intervene as a claimant intervenor in the 
98 
11 
matter and I'm going to deny that - the Motion 
12 
to Intervene. 
You're here as a claimant. And 
13 
I'm assuming that you will file your formal 
14 
creditors claim. 
You know you face that 
15 
lien. You have the Criminal Activity Lien 
16 
Notice. 
17 
So that being said, also there's 
18 
a Motion to Intervene filed by Attorney 
19 
D' Amour . The Court recognize you are a 
20 
claimant. 
You represent c l aimants for the 
21 
estate. You may have a claim against the 
22 
estate. I'm going to deny the Motion To 
23 
Intervene also for those claimants represented 
24 
by Attorney D'Arnour. Is he still present in 
25 
the court? 

Pr obat e st-1 9- PB-0080 
99 
1 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: Yes, Your Honor. 
2 
THE COURT: Yes, you are. You have 
3 
filed claims against the estate. 
You just 
4 
need to perfect those claims, provide the 
5 
information, whether it's by judgment or 
6 
should this voluntary program be established 
7 
by the Court, but as the Court has not now 
8 
allowed anyone to intervene, 
this matter will 
9 
proceed just as if it was a regular probate 
10 
proceeding. The estate Counsel is here. 
The 
11 
Court is here. I'll allow you to present the 
12 
testimony limited to what the Court believe it 
13 
needs concerning this program. Sir? 
14 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Sorry to 
15 
interrupt but we also had a motion to proceed 
16 
anonymously for claimants. 
17 
THE COURT: With that, let me say 
18 
that proceed in the same name in which you 
19 
were proceeding in the New York Courts or 
20 
whatever courts you are filing this assault 
21 
case. It just seems to me that would make it 
22 
easier because then when you bring your 
23 
judgment, should you have a judgment that 
24 
comes in as a creditors claim, the Court would 
25 
know what claim it goes with. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
100 
1 
So, file your claim in the name, 
2 
however you are proceeding in whatever Court 
3 
you are proceeding in with the sexual assault. 
4 
Fair enough, all Counsel? 
So the motion would 
5 
be persons will then file however you are 
6 
proceeding under, the claim would be filed i n 
7 
the same way. 
Attorney Smith. 
8 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I just have one 
9 
procedural question, Your Honor. 
To the 
10 
extent that you've denied the Government's 
11 
Motion to Intervene, how would we file any 
12 
response to-- cause we decided to file the 
13 
Motion To Intervene in order to be able to 
14 
file the opposition which has not been 
15 
formally f iled. 
I t was just filed as an 
16 
attachment. 
17 
THE COURT: 
You come in as 
18 
claimant, right, so you would be presented 
19 
before the Court . 
20 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, the motion 
21 
to intervene was premised on the criminal 
22 
activity lien and so once we were able to 
23 
intervene we would then file an opposition as 
24 
a movant of sorts. 
I'm just trying to figure 
25 
it out procedurally . 

erobate ST-19-eB-0080 
1 
THE COURT: Okay. 
I'm not 
2 
leaving you intervene for probate purposes. 
3 
Now, you have this civil --
4 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Criminal. 
101 
5 
THE COURT: And I don't know what 
6 
happens over there. 
Once that case has been 
7 
filed, then I guess you would file it and then 
8 
show the Court why you have to be here making 
9 
opposition to whatever we have. 
But right now 
10 
I'm not allowing you to ask questions of the 
11 
person on the stand. 
Do you understand that? 
12 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
13 
THE COURT: Should you go farther 
14 
there, right, you have a lien. 
If I 
15 
understand it , thee should 
e then so e 
in 
16 
of action filed . 
17 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It has been 
18 
filed. 
19 
THE COURT: It has been filed? 
20 
Well, I don't have it. 
I know there was a 
21 
lien. 
22 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It was attached 
23 
to the motion. 
24 
THE COURT: Not what I have, I 
25 
don't believe.

ATTORNEY SMITH: It has five 
THE COURT: Then once it's her e 
4 
and you hear that, if you believe this program 
5 
would affect your claim, then you would have a 
6 
right to file your opposition but I'm not 
7 
going to a llow you to be questioning the 
8 
wi tness. 
Do you understand that ? 
9 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
10 
THE COURT: I'm not going to 
11 
allow --or when you submit your cl aim, fo l low 
12 
the claim procedures and the executors will 
13 
review it, whether they approve it or reject, 
14 
guess what? 
Then you move the Court to hold a 
15 
hearing and then we go i n full presentation. 
16 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
17 
THE COURT: Fair enough. 
All 
18 
right. 
Okay, Sir, and for the record, 
19 
Attorney. 
20 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, I 
21 
had assistance from your col league here to the 
22 
left . 
23 
THE COURT: My able law clerk, 
24 
Attorney Harrigan. 
Yes, we do have your 
25 
application for pro hac vice admission that 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
103

was approved and signed by Justice Cabret 
2 
January 30th at 2020. 
And we have your oath

that was attested by the Clerk of the Court,

Attorney Handy February 3rd at 2020. So you 
5 
are properly before the Court. We will now

A. 
Jordana Harris Feldman. 
Q. 
Where do you live? 
A. 
New York City. 
Q. 
Did you come down in St. Thomas 
17 
specifically to testify in this proceeding? 
18 
A. 
Yes. 
19 
Q. 
And are you familiar with our 
20 
filing indicating on January 9th in our brief 
21 
that you would be here to answer questions 
22 
that the Court 
may have? 
23 
A. 
Yes. 
24 
Q. 
And where were you most recently 
25 
employed? 

Probat e ST-19-PB- 0080 
104 
1 
A. 
I worked at the September 11 
2 
Victim Compensation Fund. 
3 
Q. 
And briefly describe that fund for 
4 
the Court? 
5 
A. 
It's a federal program that was 
6 
established in the aftermath of the September 
7 
11th attack to compensate the families of 
8 
those who died and people who were injured in 
9 
the immediate aftermath of the attack. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
Q. 
What was your position there? 
A. 
I was Deputy Special Master and 
Director of the New York office. 
Q. 
How long did you hold that 
14 
position.? 
15 
A. 
I held that position for three 
16 
years but I worked through the Justice 
17 
Department and with the program for over ten 
18 
years in its various iterations beginning in 
19 
2001 and then when it was re-opened in 2011. 
20 
Q. 
And did you leave the 911 fund 
21 
generally your position there to embark on 
22 
working on this program? 
23 
A. 
Yes. 
24 
Q. 
And just briefly describe your

responsibilities with the 911 fund?

25 
Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
105 
A. 
I ran our appeals process which 
afforded any claimant an opportunity to 
challenge eligibility and compensation 
determinations if they didn't believe that the 
decision appropriately accounted for their 
circumstances. 
I presided over or participated 
in hundreds of those hearings. 
They were 
intended both as an opportunity for the 
claimant to supplement the record and be heard 
and also for us to acknowledge the traumatic 
experience that each claimant had been through 
and the impact that it had on their lives. 
Q. 
I'm going to shorten what I was 
going to cover with you but have you devoted 
t he bulk of your professional career to mass 
work or mass c l aims programs? 
A. 
I have. 
Q. 
And you have developed a fair 
amoun 
of ex ertise at it, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
It's de f initel y a niche 
practice but this is the kind of claims 
compensation programs outside of traditional 
litigation similar to what we do with the 
September 11th fund determining eligibil ity, 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
106 
1 
determining compensation, figuring out a 
2 
claims process, intended to be expeditious, 
3 
voluntary. 
That is my experience with the 911 
4 
program. 
S 
Q. 
And do you recognize this book 
6 
that I'm holding up? 
7 
A. 
I do. 
8 
Q. 
It's Mass Claim Resolution 
9 
Facilities. Who is the author? 
10 
A. 
I'm a co-author of that book. 
11 
Q. 
And basically what does the book 
12 
13 
cover? 
A. 
It provides case studies of mass 
14 
claims resolutions facilities outside of 
15 
litigation, and offers some practical guidance 
16 
in navigating the design, implementation and 
17 
administration of those programs. 
18 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, I 
19 
would just like to offer now just to speed us 
20 
up Ms. Feldman's biography. It's been 
21 
distilled to one page. 
22 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, is 
23 
it possible even though I'm not allowed to ask 
24 
questions that I can see the CD. 
25 
THE COURT: 
Do you an have extra

copy? 
Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
107 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Absolutely.

I'm just putting it on the record, Your Honor.

I'm not going to ask any questions. I want to

move us forward.

10 
11 
12 
13 
Q. 
When were you first approached 
regarding a possible compensation program that 
related to Mr. Epstein? 
A. 
In late September 2019. 
Q. 
Who first contacted you? 
A. 
Dan Weiner. 
Q. 
And did you have conversations and 
14 
meetings thereafter with the state 
15 
representative? 
16 
A. 
Yes. I h ad several meetings by 
17 
phone and then in person with representat ives 
18 
of the estate. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Q. 
And where did those conversations 
end up in terms of your career? 
A. 
They asked me to serve as a 
co-designer of the program and also to 
administer the program once it was up and 
running. 
Q. 
Do you know a gentleman named 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
Kenneth Feinberg? 
A. 
I do. I know him well. 
Q. 
How do you know him? 
108 
1 
2 
3 
4 
A. 
Mr. Feinberg was my professor in 
5 
law school in a course about Individual 
6 
Justice in Mass Torts Context. We worked very 
7 
closely together in the first iteration of the 
8 
September 11th Victims Compensation Fund. We 
9 
sat on this Mass Claims Commission that 
10 
resulted in the book that you just offered, 
11 
and he's been a mentor to me through out my 
12 
professional career. 
13 
Q. 
Before you took on this new 
14 
responsibility related to Mr. Epstein, did you 
15 
consult with Mr. Feinberg? 
16 
A. 
I did. 
17 
Q. 
And I was pointing backwards, is 
18 
Mr. Feinberg in the courtroom here today? 
19 
A. 
Yes, sir, he is. 
20 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: For the record 
21 
he is the gentleman waiving to my right. 
22 
THE COURT: Good afternoon, Sir. 
23 
By Attorney Tomback : 
24 
Q. 
Did Mr. Feinberg have a role in 
25 
the compensation program?

Proba t e ST-1 9-PB-0080 
109 
A. 
Yes. He was also selected to act 
as a co-designer of the program and helped to 
implement it. 
Q. 
And was one of the first things 
hat you did--
I ' m sorry . There ' s a third 
person that you worked with. 
Who was that? 
A. 
Camille Biros. 
Q. 
And the three of you, was one of 
the first things the three of you put together 
called a mission statement? 
A. 
Yes. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: If I may offer 
that, Your Honor. 
I don't know what the 
14 
Court's 
intention is with numbering things. 
15 
16 
I would call this Number 2 and the Bar Number 
1. 
17 
THE COURT: 
So this lS 1; that 
18 
would be 2 . 
19 
By Attorney Tomback: 
20 
Q. 
Let me ask you a few things about 
21 
the Epstein Victims Compensation Program. 
22 
By the way, how did the program 
23 
get that name? 
24 
A. 
Mr. Feinberg, Ms. Biros and I 
25 
decided on the title. We thought it was 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
important to acknowledge upfront that these 
were Epstein victims, to acknowledge the 
wrongs that they suffered.

2

4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
And is it a voluntary reprogram? 
It is a voluntary program. 
And explain what you mean by 
voluntary? 
A. 
It just means that the victims 
9 
have a choice. If they want to resolve their 
10 
claims in an alternative way outside of the 
11 
litigation, they can participate. No one is 
12 
required to participate in the program. 
13 
The way that we have designed 
14 
the proposed design of the program, which as 
15 
you heard was supported by many of the 
16 
victims, is that a claimant could come into 
17 
the process, go through the entire process, 
18 
get a compensation determination, and then 
19 
only at that point would any sort of legal 
20 
rights be affected or compromised. We wouldn't 
21 
ask that they sign a waiver of release until 
22 
they had an opportunity to make a more 
23 
informed decision about whether the 
24 
compensation that's being offered is 
25 
attractive and appropriate for them. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
111 
1 
Q. 
Is it a confidential program as 
2 
well? 
3 
A. 
It's confidential to the extent 
4 
that we, as the program administrators and my 
5 
staff and contractors, would be protecting the 
6 
privacy of the victims. We wouldn't be sharing 
7 
any information with the estate or publicly. 
8 
But the confidential requirement is 
9 
unila,teral. It 's 
only imposed on us and 
10 
there's no requirement whatsoever that 
11 
claimants limit their-- what information they 
12 
want to share with whomever they wish -- you 
13 
know, investigators, the public. 
This is an 
14 
alternative to civil litigation and so we have 
15 
no intention to interfere with any sort of 
16 
criminal proceeding . 
17 
Q. 
Are you familiar with the civil 
18 
lawsuit that the Attorney General of the 
19 
United States Virgin Islands filed in the 
20 
other court? 
21 
A. 
Yes. 
22 
Q. 
And have you read the Complaint? 
23 
A. 
I have. 
24 
Q. 
And direct your attention--you 
25 
probably don't remember this, but I'll tell 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
1 
you --Paragraphs 87 to 88 described the 
2 
program as quote, imposing confidentiality 
3 
restrictions, close quote, on claimants. Is 
4 
that accurate? 
5 
A. 
It's not for the reasons I just 
6 
stated. 
7 
Q. 
Did you contact the Attorney 
8 
General to correct that error and any other 
9 
issues that came to your attention in 
10 
reviewing the Complaint? 
11 
A. 
I did. I sent a letter to the 
12 
Attorney General on January 16th, the day 
13 
after the Complaint was filed, not only to 
14 
correct that mischaracterization, but also 
15 
just to give her some insight into the 
112 
16 
proposed design of the program. I had attached 
17 
a draft of the protocol that we have developed 
18 
-
Mr. Feinberg, Ms. Biros and I - had 
19 
developed and circulated to the Plaintiff's 
20 
lawyers weeks before. 
21 
I explained to her in the letter 
22 
the various meetings that we had had with 
23 
Plaintiff's Counsel to get their input on the 
24 
draft protocol and seek their recommendations. 
25 
I thought it was important to 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
113 
1 
shed light on what the proposed design was so 
2 
that she understood that many of her 
3 
assumptions about the program were incorrect 
4 
and had been addressed in the draft protocol. 
5 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
6 
I'd like to have marked as Exhibit 3 that 
7 
letter. It's dated January 16, 2020. 
It's 
8 
written by Ms. Feldman to the Honorable Denise 
9 
N. George, Attorney General. 
10 
THE COURT: Okay. 
11 
By Attorney Tomback: 
12 
Q. 
Is that the letter you wrote, Ms. 
13 
Feldman, to Attorney General George? 
14 
A. 
I don't have a copy. 
15 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I'm 
16 
not questioning the witness but I do believe 
17 
tha t this goes beyond what the Court was 
18 
anticipating. 
19 
THE COURT: I think Attorney 
20 
Tomback is going to bring me to what I need to 
21 
know about the monies. I haven't heard that, 
22 
setting that up. 
That is really what I want 
23 
to know. 
24 
I think we agreed that everybody 
25 
believes this program is a great program but 

~rebate ST-19-PB- 0080 
1 
what is going to be the costs of setting up 
2 
this program? 
3 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
114 
4 
the short answer is that the costs definitely 
5 
justifies the program and we are going to get 
6 
to the cost but I just want help on one item 
7 
and you tell me if I should do it or not, but 
8 
I think that while I have Ms . Feldman here 
9 
--and quite frankly it's wonderful to come 
10 
down here. 
It's beautiful, but Ms. Feldman 
11 
is here and Mr. Feinberg is here. 
I'd like to 
12 
close the gap for the Court and so the 
13 
Attorney General understand the proposed 
14 
program is not what the Attorney General wrote 
15 
about. 
It just isn't remotely related to the 
16 
process that is laid out in her papers. 
17 
Judge, there's no live person 
18 
that the Attorney General represents. The 
19 
Attorney General represents a claim of a 
20 
client that is historical. I've just been 
21 
admitted to be pro hac. I don't profess to be 
22 
an expert of the law but I think it's clear to 
23 
everyone in the courtroom that this program 
24 
needs to go forward to save the estate, quite 
25 
frankly, just to address the victims or the 

1 
2 
3 
claimants. 
Probate ST-19-PB-OOBD 
115 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: So I just want 
4 
to put the context there and close the gaps so 
5 
the Attorney General can have some residual 
6 
concern that the estate can address and move 
7 
on and get going. 
8 
THE COURT: Okay. Continue. 
9 
By Attorney Tomback: 
10 
Q. 
Did the co-executors or Counsel, 
11 
anyone affiliated with them, direct you to 
12 
write this letter? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
letter? 
A. 
No. 
Q. 
Whose idea was it to write the 
A. 
It was my idea. 
Q. 
Okay. And the mission statement 
18 
that I showed you before, Exhi bit Number 2, 
19 
did you describe the program as a, quote, 
20 
non-adversarial alternative to litigation, 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
c l ose 
front 
given 
quote? 
A. 
It does. I don't have a copy in 
of me but I remember writing it. 
Q. 
Why is non-adversarial important 
your background and expert ise? 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
116 
1 
A. 
In these kinds of programs, you 
2 
have to remove any sort of adversarial posture 
3 
or tone. 
I mean the victims are sharing very 
4 
personal details of their lives about the 
5 
abuse whatever happened in the aftermath and 
6 
so they need to be able to feel comfortable 
7 
that they can share that information without 
8 
fear of being cross examined or interrogated 
9 
or that that will be used against them at some 
10 
later point. 
11 
Q. 
In your mission statement it also 
12 
says that the program, quote, aim to timely 
13 
resolve, close quote, claims. Why is 
14 
timeliness important? 
15 
A. 
It's important because it's 
16 
important to the victims. 
I mean the victims 
17 
are the ones who want this program to move 
18 
forward. They want an option that will 
19 
expeditiously resolve th~ir claims. 
We have 
20 
made a goal to resolve claims within sixty to 
21 
ninety days of a complete submission. 
We 
22 
wanted to make a meaningful alternative to 
23 
litigation for the victims and as you heard 
24 
today, the victims are in support of allowing 
25 
this program to move forward. 

Probate ST- 1 9- PB- 0080 
117 
1 
Q. 
The Mission statement also says 
2 
quote, the program offers a, quote, a process 
3 
that is sensitive to the experiences and 
4 
concerns of the claimants and treat them with 
5 
compassion, dignity and respect. 
6 
Why is that important and how do 
7 
you know that the program is actually going to 
8 
do that? 
9 
A. 
I know it because I have done it 
10 
before. 
I mean Mr. Feinberg has done it 
11 
before. 
You know, these programs are, we 
12 
find the victims are looking for validation as 
13 
much as they are for compensation. They want 
14 
someone to acknowledge what they have been 
15 
through and to be treated in a compassionate 
16 
and dignified way in the process. That is 
17 
exactly what I have done in the 911 fund. 
18 
Q. 
And the Mission statement also 
19 
goes on to say that the program will be run 
20 
by, quote, independent, close quote, cl aims 
21 
administration experts. What do you mean by 
22 
independent and why is that important? 
23 
A. 
Well, that's key. I mean 
24 
particularly in this unusual context but we 
25 
are, Mr. Feinberg, 
Ms. Biros and I, we are 

Probat e ST-19- PB-0080 
118 
1 
not agents of the estate. We're not here to do 
2 
their bidding. We make decisions on the design 
3 
and I will make designs on the administration 
4 
of the program, how it operates, and how 
5 
claims are determined based on our own 
6 
judgment and experience and the estate has 
7 
agreed to be removed from any part of that 
8 
process. 
9 
Q. 
And so just to focus in on an 
10 
individual claimant's claim and the amount of 
11 
compensation that the program, and you as the 
12 
administrator, arrive at, the statement 
13 
provides that quote, the estate will have no 
14 
authority to reject or modify the 
15 
administrator's determination on any bas i s or 
16 
as to any c l aims, close quote. Why is that 
17 
important to the program and the clai mants? 
18 
A. 
It's import ant because to allow 
19 
the estate a say in these deci sions 
20 
compromises the key-guiding princi p l e of the 
21 
program. It compromises our independence; it 
22 
compromises our claims and confidentiality; it 
23 
compromises the non-adversarial nature of the 
24 
program. 
25 
Q. 
And with respect to the program it 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
119 
1 
says participation in it does not affect any 
2 
rights the claimant might have unless and 
3 
until the claimant accepts the compensation, 
4 
determination, and signs a release. 
Why is it 
5 
set up that way? 
6 
A. 
It is set up again as a choice 
7 
where the legal rights are not affected until 
8 
the very end of the process, until claimants 
9 
are able to go through and eval uate her 
10 
options, see if it's something that she's 
11 
willing to accept or not, with the freedom to 
12 
withdraw the claim at any point in the process 
13 
if she's not satisfied. 
14 
And I would add that one of the 
15 
things that Mr . Feinberg and 
thought was 
16 
important to incl ude in this program was that 
17 
that also includes not requiring as a 
18 
condition of participation in the program any 
19 
victim to s t ay pending l itigation in order to 
20 
participate. Claimants can go on a parallel 
21 
track through our claims process and through 
22 
litigation if they want to seek discovery and 
23 
only at the very end of the process would they 
24 
have to make a decision of which way to go. 
25 
Q. 
Taking that out of order as far us 

Probat e ST-19- PB-0080 
120 
1 
you know have any claimants stayed voluntarily 
2 
their actions? 
3 
A. 
Yes, it is my understanding that 
4 
five Plaintiff's have stayed litigation with 
5 
the expectation that this program would be up 
6 
and running in short order because they 
7 
apparently, I understand that they believed 
8 
that this was a bona fide alternative. 
9 
Q. 
The sooner the program is up and 
10 
running, I take it the more likely it is to 
11 
have people stay their litigation, is that a 
12 
fair assumption? 
13 
A. 
That's beyond the scope of what I 
14 
can say. 
15 
Q. 
Now, the statement also says there 
16 
in the statement, Exhibit 2, quote, All 
17 
claimants will be afforded a confidential 
18 
opportunity to meet face-to-face with the 
19 
Administrator , if they so desire . 
Why is 
20 
that important? 
21 
A. 
Again, in my experience, the 
22 
victim wants an opportunity to be heard to 
23 
tell their story in a way that is rarely 
24 
captured in a paper file and so it's something 
25 
we wanted to offer the victims if they wish to 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
121 
1 
avail themselves of it. There's no requirement 
2 
that any victim come in to meet with us. If 
3 
they do want to meet, we'll make it available 
4 
in different ways but that piece is important 
5 
because of the opportunity to be heard and 
6 
tell their stories. 
7 
Q. 
Are you familiar with the Attorney 
8 
General Counsel complaint and other papers 
9 
that have expressed a concern that the 
10 
opportunity to meet face to face with you 
11 
doesn't adequately take into account some of 
12 
the persons here in the Virgin Islands? 
You 
13 
need to come to me. 
What would you do to 
14 
accommodate that? 
15 
A. 
We would accommodate. 
It's 
16 
already written into the draft protocol but we 
17 
woul d accommodate any questions. 
You know, we 
18 
can do it by teleconference, video conference. 
19 
We would be willing, as we have said to some 
20 
of the Plaintiff's lawyers who have clients in 
21 
Florida, to go to areas where there are a 
22 
number of claimant's where we could hold those 
23 
meetings face to face. 
24 
Q. 
And the mission statement refers 
25 
to a claims protocol that includes, quote 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
122 
1 
2 
3 
4 
eligibility criteria, the methodology for 
determining compensation, proof requirements 
and claims procedures, close quote. 
Can you briefly address program 
5 
protocol? 
6 
A. 
Yes. It just, it lays out the 
7 
terms and conditions or the proposed terms and 
8 
conditions of how the program would operate. 
9 
It gives some visibility of the criteria that 
10 
we'll apply when evaluating claims for 
11 
eligibility and compensation and outlines the 
12 
way that we'll process the claims and the 
13 
expectations in terms of timing. 
14 
Q. 
And how is the protocol developed? 
15 
A. 
So Mr. Feinberg, Ms. Biros and I 
16 
drafted the protocol in November and December 
17 
of 2009. One of our main objectives was to 
18 
make it as broad and as claimant friendly as 
19 
possible and with that in mind, we removed a 
20 
lot of the barriers that would apply or could 
21 
apply in litigation. 
The Statute of 
22 
Limitations is not an issue that we'll keep in 
23 
allowing people to participate; prior 
24 
settlement would not preclude someone from 
25 
participating in the program; and so we 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
123 
1 
developed a protocol with that in mind. 
2 
We want any victim who suffered 
3 
abuse to be able to come in and participate in 
4 
the program and once we had an initial draft, 
5 
we circulated it to the estate, to the 
6 
Plaintiff's lawyers, to the USVI Attorneys 
7 
Office, in the Southern District of New York 
8 
to get their feedback on the protocol. 
9 
Q. 
And just to be clear, I might not 
10 
have heard you but I take it numerous 
11 
Plaintiff's met with you and proceeded with 
12 
you or Plaintiff's Counsel, some of whom are 
13 
here? 
14 
A. 
Yes, we met with nearly all of the 
15 
lawyers we know about who represented 
16 
Plaintiffs. 
17 
Q. 
And if the Attorney General or her 
18 
representative wanted to meet with you or just 
19 
talk to you on the phone or have a series of 
20 
meetings to express concerns, will you listen 
21 
22 
to her? 
A. 
Absolutely. 
In fact, in my letter 
23 
I invited an opportunity to meet with her and 
24 
discuss more about the program and seek her 
25 
input. 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
Q. 
Have _you heard from her yet? 
A. 
I have not heard back~

ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
I would just 
like to offer up the protocol still in draft 
form. 
It's not finalized but the protocol, 
as it exists that have been provided to us for 
this purpose by Ms. Feldman, shows a track 
change based on meetings with Plaintiff's 
9 
Counsel. 
I don't want to review that. 
I 
10 
want to get this done before you lose 
11 
patience. 
12 
THE COURT: Yes. 
I want to hear 
13 
about the money. 
14 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, just 
15 
for the record I'm not going to ask a 
16 
question. 
Just that the revision of the 
17 
protocol is not what was before the Attorney 
18 
General in the letter that was sent to her. 
19 
THE WITNESS: 
As Mr. Tornback 
20 
just said, the protocol that he just offered 
21 
has a red line copy. 
Only the red lines are 
22 
new; anything additional to that, we 
23 
circul ated to the Attorney General. 
24 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, I 
25 
have one more topic to cover, which is to 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
provide briefly an overview of the actual 
2 
claims process. 
So if we can mark this as 
3 
Exhibit 5. 
4 
I just want to provide some 
125 
5 
context because the program is not -- you need 
6 
to understand the program, I think, to 
7 
evaluate the costs. 
8 
By Attorney Tomback: 
9 
Q. 
So taking a look at Exhibit 5, i s 
10 
that in front of you? 
11 
A. 
Not yet. 
12 
Q. 
Let me wait. 
I'm reminded by my 
13 
colleagues for the record of Exhibi t 5 which 
14 
I'm going to offer and when the wi tness 
15 
identifies it, then I will put it into 
16 
evidence. 
It's entitled the overview of the 
17 
claims process. 
18 
So directing your attention to 
19 
the third paragraph, it says, quote, Claimants 
20 
who 
voluntarily elect to file a cl aim with 
21 
the program will be invited to participate 
22 
--excuse me --invited to provide documentation 
23 
identified in the claim form devel oped by the 
24 
claims admini stration experts and any 
25 
additional corroborating or supporting 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
126 
1 
information to substantiate their claims. 
2 
Can you offer to the Court how 
3 
that works in practice? 
4 
A. 
So we all developed a claim form 
5 
that will look to capture just some basic 
6 
information about the claimant, about the 
7 
circumstances of her abuse, the type of abuse, 
8 
the location, when it happened, how long it 
9 
happened, and invite her to submit any sort of 
10 
documentation she might have to help 
11 
corroborate the claim. 
12 
Q. 
And if there is a deficiency in 
13 
the claim, will the claimant and other Counsel 
14 
have an opportunity to correct that or address 
15 
it? 
16 
A. 
Yes. The program, as we have done 
17 
in other programs we have administered before, 
18 
is intended to be claimant-friendly. 
So if 
19 
someone files a deficient claim, we'll do a 
20 
preliminary review, identify what the 
21 
deficiency is, do out-reach to the claimant or 
22 
her representative, and work them to try to 
23 
address the deficiency. 
24 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
25 
much of the Mission Statement speaks for 

Proba te ST-19- PB-008 0 
1 
itself. 
If you don't mind I will quote two 
2 
more paragraphs then move on. 
3 
By Attorney Tornback: 
127 
4 
Q. 
If you look, Ms. Feldman, at the 
5 
fourth full Paragraph, Line 5, where the word 
6 
once appears on the right, can you just read 
7 
that into the record and comment on that for 
8 
us? 
9 
A. 
"Once a completed claim has been 
10 
submitted, the Administrator will evaluate the 
11 
claim based on all available information and 
12 
will issue a determination regarding whether 
13 
the claimant is eligible to receive 
14 
compensation and the amount of compensation to 
15 
be paid to an eligible claimant." 
16 
The individual claim 
17 
determination will be based on that factor in 
18 
the considerations identified in the protocol. 
19 
It speaks for itself. 
20 
Q. 
I don't have any questions. I 
21 
just wanted to cover that. 
I want to get to 
22 
sort of an end game of how the process works. 
23 
In your overview statement there's an ultimate 
24 
paragraph and I will read that into the 
25 
record, "Upon the issuance of a compensation 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
128 
1 
determination by the Administrator", that's 
2 
you, "the claimant will have complete freedom 
3 
to accept or reject that determination. 
If 
4 
the claimant elects to accept the 
5 
determination, the claimant will sign a 
6 
release waiving the claimant's rights to 
7 
litigate in the courts, as set forth in the 
8 
protocol. Upon the Administrator's receipt of 
9 
the claimant's acceptance of the compensation 
10 
determination and executed release, the 
11 
Administrator will authorize payment to the 
12 
claimant". 
13 
Do you have anything to add to 
14 
that ? 
15 
A. 
Only that the idea of this type of 
16 
program, as with the other programs that Mr. 
17 
Feinberg and I have administered, is to get 
18 
these victims paid quickly. 
So our 
19 
expectation is t hat once we issue a 
20 
determination, if the claimant accepts it, and 
21 
sends in the release, we will immediately 
22 
notify the estate and our expectation is that 
23 
they will disburse the funds very shortly 
24 
25 
thereafter. 
Q 
And are you familiar with the 
,___ ___________________________ __,,, 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
129 
1 
Attorney General lawsuit? 
This is, again, 
2 
that Complaint of Paragraph 88 where they say 
3 
the program, quote, requires any claimant 
4 
accepting an award under the program is 
5 
sacrificing any other claims against any 
6 
persons or entity arising from or related to 
7 
Mr. Epstein. Closed quote. 
Do you view that 
8 
criticism as sensible? 
9 
A. 
Well, like I said before, this 
10 
program is not intended to interfere with any 
11 
sort of criminal investigation and the scope 
12 
of the release has not yet been determined. 
13 
Ultimately, I mean, that is something that the 
14 
estate is, I understand, 1s working on and 
15 
ultimately if a claimant believes that their 
16 
rights are unfairly compromised, she has the 
17 
freedom not to sign the release. 
18 
Q. 
Right. 
And if a claimant signs a 
19 
release and, for example, the United States 
20 
Virgin Islands Attorney General wants that 
21 
claimant to serve as a witness in a criminal 
22 
investigation, hypothetically, the person can 
23 
still receive compensation, sign a full 
24 
release in terms of civil claims of the 
25 
estate--if it i s not scheduled another time 

Pr obate ST- 19-PB-0080 
130 
1 
and the Attorney General could still sit with 
2 
that person and perhaps use her as a witness 
3 
or to help the Attorney General's 
4 
investigation; is that fair? 
5 
A. 
Absolutely, like I said before 
6 
nothing limits the claimant from speaking with 
7 
investigators about the circumstances. 
8 
Q. 
Just in terms of the civil release 
9 
itself, those are common in your experience? 
10 
In other words, that you settle sort of total 
11 
settlement? 
12 
A. 
Absolutely and actually, this is 
13 
different from the 911 context where the 
14 
waiver attaches at the very beginning of the 
1.5 
process upon submission of the claim. 
16 
Here, we thought it would be 
17 
beneficial to the claimant to wait until the 
18 
end of the process so that they have a more 
19 
informed understanding about what they would 
20 
receive. 
21 
22 
23 
Q. 
I'm just going to go through this 
fast. 
You set up a website, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
We started to develop a 
24 
website. 
We will set up a website. 
25 
Q. 
And you set up a commencement 

Probate ST-19-PB~OOBO 
131 
1 
date, a start date, a let's-go date? 
2 
A. 
We have not. 
We are tying it to 
3 
approval by the Court to allow the program to 
4 
move forward but we will be once it's approved 
5 
by the Court, we can be up and running within 
6 
ninety days and I expect, because of the 
7 
considerable amount of work that we have done 
8 
up until then, we would be able to do that 
9 
even more quickly. 
10 
Q. 
Last point before turning to the 
11 
anticipated cost of the program, there's a 
12 
deadline for the submission of claims. Why do 
13 
you have to have a deadline? 
14 
A. 
Because deadlines motivate people 
15 
to act. It provides certainty. 
We found in 
16 
our experience that people often wait till the 
17 
very end of the process to file their claims, 
18 
the last day, because life gets in the way and 
19 
it's not a priority until it becomes a 
20 
priority. 
21 
So we proposed in the draft 
22 
protocol making a 90-day filing window, and we 
23 
didn't hear any feedback from anyone that that 
24 
was an inappropriately short period of time so 
25 
that's our expectation. 

Probate ST-19-PB-00 80 
132 
1 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK : 
So, Your 
2 
Honor, the budget for the program, can I have 
3 
this marked as Exhibit Number 6 and then, I 
4 
think, it would be best to mark Number 7. 
5 
Number 7, if it's admitted into evidence, is 
6 
the engagement letter that Ms. Feldman signed 
7 
with one of the counsels for the estate. 
8 
By Attorney Tomback: 
9 
Q. 
So I'm told that the actual 
10 
signatories for the engagement letter is not 
11 
12 
13 
counsel but all co-executors? 
A. 
It was like not me. 
Right. 
Q. 
Precisely. Al l right. 
So is it 
14 
correct that the design and the implementation 
15 
on the operation of the program such as this 
16 
requires significant personnel and costs? 
17 
A. 
It requires a specialized 
18 
expertise in a unique area and it requi res 
19 
buil ding out the infrastructure to support the 
20 
operation. 
21 
Q. 
And is there a budget prepared by 
22 
you, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros? 
23 
A. 
Yes . 
24 
Q. 
And at the beginning when the 
25 
budget was put together, had you redacted the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
133 
1 
fees for Mr . E stei --excuse m -- or Mr . 
2 
einberg and fo 
you upfront? 
3 
A. 
We did. 
4 
Q. 
And wh y was there concern about 
5 
not having that being the very first thing 
6 
that people focused on? 
7 
A. 
We just felt like it was a 
8 
distraction at the very beginning. 
9 
Q. 
The copy that you presented to the 
10 
Court, which is Exhibit 6, is un-redacted, and 
11 
so let me just h~ve one more minute. 
12 
So Ms. Feldman, turning here to 
13 
Page 3 of Exhibit 6, the esti mated budget, I 
14 
think i t's probably just easier if you walked 
15 
us through --without quoting necessarily --but 
16 
walk through the large p i eces of these 
17 
expenses for the program and t hen I wi l l ask 
18 
you some questions about them. 
19 
A. 
You said Page 3? 
20 
Q. 
Yes, but let me start by --this 
21 
i sn't something we really prepared but -- how 
22 
many people have the sort of expertise that 
23 
you do and Mr. Fei nberg does to conduct a 
24 
program like this? 
25 
A. 
I don't know of many people. Mr. 

Probat e ST-19- PB- 0080 
1 
Feinberg is obviously the leading person in 
2 
this area. 
It's a pretty small group of 
3 
people who do this kind of work. 
134 
4 
Q. 
So I'm not great with analogies, 
5 
but if I were to compare Mr. Feinberg to a 
6 
car, right, would he be a good car--Let's not 
7 
talk about the --is he the best in the area in 
8 
your view? 
9 
A. 
In my view he is the best. 
10 
Q. 
And in considerati on of how to set 
11 
up the fund in terms of the program, in terms 
12 
of design and in terms of administration, 
13 
without giving anything away that is 
14 
privileged, the group that came together to 
15 
figure out how to t ry to do this -- firs t of 
16 
al l , are you familiar with the fact that the 
17 
group of executors, co-executors and thei r 
18 
Counsel looked at other candidates other than 
19 
you? 
20 
A. 
I understand that you met with 
21 
several other people. 
22 
Q. 
And in talking through exactly how 
23 
to structure the relationship between the--
24 
wel l , relati onship between you and Mr. 
25 
Feinberg, are you familiar with some thoughts 

Prob ate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
1 
or what you thought about why you should be 
2 
the administrator rather than Mr. Feinberg 
135 
3 
being the administrator and who should focus 
4 
on design? 
5 
A. 
It was rny--I mean, you probably 
6 
could speak to this selection process better 
7 
than I can, but it is my understanding that 
8 
you were looking for someone who both had 
9 
experience and had sensitivity to the victims' 
10 
experiences and I believe you were looking for 
11 
a female to run the program. 
12 
Q. 
And so can you just walk through 
13 
them with the budget? 
Starting with the first 
14 
part of the budget, what are the payments to 
15 
Mr. Feinberg? 
I guess that's the start. 
16 
A. 
Well, he was retained to design 
17 
the program based on his very extensive 
18 
experience so the fees are related to the 
19 
drafting of the protocol, the meetings that we 
20 
had with the Plaintiffs' lawyers, all of the 
21 
work that goes into bringing his years and 
22 
years of experience to bear, and in designing 
23 
and then the implementation of the program. 
24 
Q. 
And then turning to the second 
25 
part in terms of your fees -- first of all, 

~r ebat e ST-19-PB-0080 
136 
1 
just to divert and try to pick up on that 
2 
area, you are currently, you are working sort 
3 
of in the hope that the program will be 
4 
approved, right? 
5 
A. 
Yes. 
6 
Q. 
I mean, you are just between jobs, 
7 
effectively working on this? 
8 
A. 
Yes. 
I have left my job with the 
9 
911 fund to do this program because I truly 
10 
believe it was in the best interest of the 
11 
victims. 
12 
So since November, we have been 
13 
working full steam ahead to get this process 
14 
up and running because we believe it's the 
15 
right thing to do, but I have not been 
16 
compensated and more importantly, I haven't 
17 
been able to compensate other people who have 
18 
been willing to dive in and start doing work 
19 
to ensure the timely 
implementation of the 
20 
program . 
21 
Q. 
And the budget specifically says--
22 
going back to Mr. Feinberg--so this is on the 
23 
record, it says after listing a number of 
24 
services that will be offered that Mr. 
25 
Feinberg's law offices will receive $850,000 

Probate ST-19-PB-00 80 
137 
1 
per month and it says for a maximum period of 
2 
two months. 
It says, "thereafter, all ongoing 
3 
consulting services provided by Mr. Feinberg 
4 
and Ms. Biros will be deemed to be included in 
5 
the above-referenced fee." 
6 
Do you understand Mr. Feinberg to 
7 
have made a commitment after the two months 
8 
are over to provide services for free? 
9 
A. 
Yes. 
10 
Q. 
And in your experiences will he 
11 
stick with the program or will he disappear? 
12 
A. 
He always stick with the program. 
13 
He i s very rel iable, very reliable. 
14 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
15 
the budget, those are the main pieces. 
We 
16 
can walk through --
17 
THE COURT: 
Tell me the bottom 
18 
line. 
19 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
The bottom 
20 
l ine of t he budget ? 
21 
THE COURT: The budget has a 
22 
bottom line. 
Are you going to rent office 
23 
spaces? 
24 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
We can walk 
25 
through that, Your Honor. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
138 
1 
THE COURT: Just tell me what the 
2 
office space is . You know, and this question 
3 
about Mr. Feinberg, this $850,000 a month for 
4 
two months; is that to him or his law firm? 
5 
THE WITNESS: 
The law firm . 
6 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: The law Office 
7 
and just to be clear, so he'll bring to bear 
8 
the whole thing --
9 
THE COURT: I just want to know 
10 
if it's to the law firm? 
11 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Yes, and Ms. 
12 
Biros alluding- -
13 
THE COURT: Let's just get it for 
14 
the persons here, right? 
Remember, you have 
15 
been kind enough to give Government Counsel 
16 
copies of the budget and other documents, but 
17 
remember there are other counsels for 
18 
claimants' present who that was their concern 
19 
concerning their claims and they have not been 
20 
given that information and will have to wait 
21 
until the session adjourns to go to the 
22 
clerk's office to get copies. 
So I just want 
23 
you to give us where the large expenses would 
24 
be. 
25 
By Attorney Tomback: 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
139 
1 
So, Ms. Feldman, the payments used 
2 
for the duration for programs, right, which 
3 
were how many months is the estimate, assuming 
4 
the timeline? 
5 
A. 
The estimated budget assumed 12 to 
6 
14 months to design, implement, administer 
7 
from start to finish. 
I think that the 
8 
estimation was made with the expectation in. 
9 
November that it would be approved in short 
10 
order and that we would be able to execute the 
11 
contract with vendors and contractors which we 
12 
have not been able to do because I don't have 
13 
the authority to do it. 
14 
So we have done all of the work up 
15 
until that point but have not yet been able to 
16 
execute and some people have had to decline to 
17 
participate because of the passage of time. 
18 
We still anticipated it being a relatively 
19 
short time frame. 
I don't know if it will be 
20 
within the 12 to 14 month period. 
That number 
21 
also assumes, you know, depending on the 
22 
number of claimants, and that is not just 
23 
legitimate claimants. We will be accepting 
24 
claims from some claimants who were determined 
25 
not to be eligible and those are claims that 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
140 
1 
have to go through the process just like any 
2 
other claims in order to get to that 
3 
determination. 
4 
Q. 
And so with respect to your 
5 
personal fees, is the fee $150,000 a month for 
6 
the estimated 12 to 14, and if necessary 
7 
additional, months? 
8 
A. 
I'm sorry. 
9 
Q. 
Just to understand, if you look at 
10 
B {i} for Design and implementation for the 
11 
entire program, what is the fee that will be 
12 
paid to you, Ms. Feldman? 
13 
A. 
After the 14 months? 
14 
Q. 
No. 
In total for during the 
15 
14-month period? 
16 
A. 
It would be that, times 14. 
17 
Q. 
Right? And then with respect to--
18 
I mean, just walking through this so it's in 
19 
the record even though the documents are 
20 
there, in terms of the fees and expenses that 
21 
will be required to be paid and operation of 
22 
the claims process, you have the backroom 
23 
costs, some sort of website, the distribution 
24 
of program documents, developing of procedures 
25 
to track the claims, to investigate the claims 

Probate ST-19-PB-0 080 
141 
1 
and to supervise a toll -free calling center, 
2 
do you estimate the projected costs for that 
3 
for the entire program to be in the range of 
4 
$150,000 to $250,000? 
5 
A. 
Yes, that is what we estimated in 
6 
November. 
7 
Q. 
The Attorney General said a month 
8 
but 1s that not for the whol e program? 
9 
A. 
Right. 
Most of those are cost 
10 
that would be up front in terms of t he 
11 
development of the website. 
We want to 
12 
develop functionality to allow someone to 
13 
submit a claim electronically, but that is for 
14 
the duration of the program. 
15 
Q. 
And then in terms of staffing, 
16 
depending upon the number of c l aimants who 
17 
come forward, there's provision in the budget 
18 
f or up to - not necessaril y three, but up to -
19 
three attorneys to support your program and 
20 
t hen 
administ rative support, data analyt i cal 
21 
support , inform-tion 
echnology 
ppor , 
22 
23 
etcetera. 
So those staffing services mont hly 
24 
cost s are estimated to be in the range of 
25 
$160,000 but that can change if you were to 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
become --that would be addressed for more 
2 
people, correct? 
142 
3 
A. 
Yes. 
These estimates are based on 
4 
whatever information we had available at the 
5 
time that we drafted this in November. 
6 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
7 
there's one other topic that I would like to--
8 
I have to do one other thing is what I'm told. 
9 
By Attorney Tornback: 
10 
Q. 
This final item is in the 
11 
estimated budget on Page 5 that you need to 
12 
have office 
spaces and equipment. 
You can't 
13 
use your old spaces, right? 
And there are 
14 
other employee costs in the range of 15 to 
15 
20,000; is that correct? 
16 
A. 
That's right. 
17 
Q. 
That is additional cost, okay. 
18 
The last topic I want to cover, 
19 
Your Honor, is timing. So we touched on timing 
20 
but can you just express in a nutshell how 
21 
important it is for the program toge· 
oing? 
22 
A. 
It's extremely important. 
23 
Q. 
Why? 
24 
A. 
Because the victims want it to 
25 
move forward. 
I mean, to hear many of their 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
1 
representatives come up and say i t actually 
2 
impacted me even more than just-- this was 
143 
3 
particularly imp-ressive upon me because these 
4 
victims have been at the precipice of 
5 
opportunity to get some measure of justice i n 
6 
many different points and it's been pulled out 
7 
from under them or delayed in some way . 
8 
And we are now at a poi nt where 
9 
we invested a considerable amount of time to 
10 
put together a draft of what the program would 
11 
look like to seek the input of the plaintiffs' 
12 
lawyers. 
We have their support and the 
13 
victims are now, from my understanding in 
14 
speaking with many of the Plaintiffs' lawyers, 
15 
they have had conversations with their clients 
16 
and their clients are really eager to have 
17 
this process move forward . 
18 
And their expectations have been 
19 
raised in terms of i t being implemented in 
20 
short order and so to delay this further would 
21 
really be a great d i s-service to these 
22 
victims. 
23 
Q. 
Just so I sort of break them 
24 
int o-- I call them claimants; you call them 
25 
victims but it's the same thi ng-- j ust put them 

Probate ST-1 9-PB - 0080 
144 
1 
in two categories, okay? 
One category are 
2 
Plaintiffs who've already brought sui t through 
3 
their counsels - the bulk of them in New York. 
4 
If the program doesn't go forward, then they 
5 
would be stuck litigating, right? 
I mean, 
6 
they're going to have to litigate. Is that a 
7 
fair assessment of what's going to happen to 
8 
them? 
9 
A. 
That's my understanding. 
10 
Q. 
Okay. 
I want to address this 
11 
separately. I mean, I think that the Court 
12 
understands that, so I don't want to bel abor 
13 
it but I just want to address a separate 
14 
group, which is, if a person whose claim that 
15 
she's been harmed by Mr. Epstein but for 
16 
whatever reason does not want to go to court, 
17 
want s the confi dentiality, wants to sit with 
18 
you and not sit in a courtroom and testify and 
19 
so forth and so on, if the program doesn't go 
20 
forward, what happens, in your view, to that 
21 
22 
23 
person? 
A. 
She's left without recourse. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK : One moment, Your 
24 
Honor. 
I think I'm done here. So I just have 
25 
one more question of Ms. Feldman and I wanted 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
1 
to call Mr. Feinberg solely to address the 
2 
prior • concern that the Attorney General has. 
3 
And Your Honor, I don't want to 
4 
THE COURT: But you know what? 
145 
5 
It's not about the Attorney General's concern. 
6 
My concern is you are coming here to ask this 
7 
Court to £und this program. 
My concern is 
8 
what types of monies are you talking of? 
That 
9 
is what you need to address - not the Attorney 
10 
General, r i ght? 
11 
How much money are you talking 
12 
about that I would have to say, allow the 
13 
executor's, co-executors to move from the 
14 
estate to this program? 
15 
Ms. Feldman, would you be able 
16 
to say, based on your experience, what would 
17 
be the range of settlement in these types of 
18 
matters? 
19 
THE WITNESS: 
Well, it's--let me 
20 
just preface it by saying, you know, we have 
21 
gotten representati on from the estate that 
22 
there wi ll be no cap on either a given amount 
23 
on the individual claims, and I believe Mr. 
24 
Foster made this point, it is impossible to 
25 
value these claims in the abstract, right. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
146 
1 
There are different circumstances in each case 
2 
so it's hard to say. 
3 
You know, I think that we are 
4 
talking about, you know, claims that would 
5 
range from the thousands of dollars up into 
6 
the millions of dollars. 
7 
THE COURT: Would this be where 
8 
you could 
and I think you may have 
9 
testified to this -- you could enter an 
10 
agreement with these claimants/ victims as to 
11 
the settlement amounts, they sign the release 
12 
and they understand they may have to wait for 
13 
their payment because I think you said that 
14 
the whole idea is to have them fully 
15 
compensated within a short period of time. 
16 
THE WITNESS: But the goal would 
17 
BE that once they sign the release and we are 
18 
able to notify the estate that the estate 
19 
would be able to disburse that money almost 
20 
immediately. 
I understand from the Catholic 
21 
Church Sex abuse cases, it's turned around in 
22 
a week or two. In the September 11th program, 
23 
they were also able to turn it around in a few 
24 
weeks time so that would be the goal. 
25 
THE COURT: That would be the 

Probate ST- 1 9- PB- 0080 
147 
1 
goal b t you un ers and in his matter, the 
2 
Government of the Virgin Island has filed an 
3 
action that may impede that? 
4 
THE WITNESS: 
I would say that 
5 
to the extent that the Government's interest 
6 
is at least in part to protect the victims' 
7 
interest, that interest is not being served by 
8 
them trying to step in and take priority over 
9 
the victims. 
10 
THE COURT: 
Well, I don't know. 
11 
The People will have to speak to where their 
12 
interest lies, but I know what the People have 
13 
filed to put a l ien on all the properties of 
14 
the estate. 
15 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I asked 
16 
counsel whether there are any claimants, any 
17 
individual people that they represent. 
18 
THE COURT: 
Well, the Government 
19 
never represent individual people. The 
20 
Government represents the People of the Virgin 
21 
22 
Islands. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Right, but 
23 
just to be clear, there is no claimant that 
24 
would receive those monies. There are 
25 
criticisms about the program in terms of how 

1 
2 
3 
Probate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
it will treat claimants, but they have no 
claimants. 
148 
THE COURT: 
If I understand what 
4 
the People of the Virgin Islands is saying is 
5 
they are concerned that this program could 
6 
wipe out whatever they believe they should be 
7 
entitled to under the action they have filed. 
8 
That's what I am trying to get, what is the 
9 
bottom line? 
How much money are you talking 
10 
about? 
Is there anyway to segregate and say 
11 
whatever the People are coming against and 
12 
they have listed what they are seeking, what 
13 
property they put a lien on. 
They haven't put 
14 
a lien on-- well, they put a lien on the 
15 
entire estate which all these shares are 
16 
sitting in the estate--that is what I am 
17 
trying to getr and I think it maybe you have 
18 
to talk to the People. 
19 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: The only thing 
20 
I believe I can help in one respect is that 
21 
the co-executors and their Counsel believe-~ 
22 
first of all, there's a net savings of 
23 
litigation costs to the estate to proceeding 
24 
25 
in this way. 
THE COURT: 
Sir, you are 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
149 
1 
missing --I understand that. 
I totally get it 
2 
that it will be for everybody involved less 
3 
costly to enter into the settlement program 
4 
than to litigate. 
I get that in terms of 
5 
money; in terms of time. 
6 
But I'm also backed up where I 
7 
have what the People of the Virgin Islands, 
8 
The Government of the Virgin Islands has filed 
9 
this Criminal Activity Lien Notice which tells 
10 
me that everything that they have taken this 
11 
lien, nothing can be disbursed. That is where 
12 
we are. What can I do at this point with this 
13 
notice that has been given to the Court? 
14 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Two ways, Your 
15 
Honor, that I think that we can try to address 
16 
that. One way is to point out that the 
17 
concerns expressed about the program are not 
18 
accurate. 
I think Ms. Feldman has 
19 
THE COURT: Sir --
20 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: And the second 
21 
way --
22 
THE COURT: 
No. 
Listen. I 
23 
disagree. 
I don't think whatever concerns 
24 
they had about the program, that's not before 
25 
me. 
I understand that The Government of the 

Probat e ST- 19- PB- 0080 
150 
1 
Virgin Islands is saying I'm going in to take 
2 
a stake in this forfeiture action to take 
3 
control. It's not about the program. They are 
4 
saying don't pay out anything on the program 
5 
because you could not distribute anything from 
6 
this estate because I have filed this lien and 
7 
this lien says any trustee, executor, person 
8 
or institution who moves, transfer or conveys 
9 
title to personal or real property upon which 
10 
a Criminal Activity Lien Notice has been filed 
11 
which the personal or real property is located 
12 
or who transfers or conveys such property 
13 
while having actual notice of this lien shall 
14 
be liable to the Attorney General. 
That is 
15 
the concern. 
That is what they are seeking 
16 
here or they come in. 
17 
And I told Attorney Smith she 
18 
couldn't ask any questions, but that is what I 
19 
understood; that by this program you said you 
20 
could enter into settlement you said ten 
21 
thousand to tens of thousands of dollars to 
22 
persons and then their concern is and then we 
23 
get our forfeiture judgment and there's 
24 
nothing there. Do you understand? 
That is 
25 
what I understand the Government is moving. 

Probate ST~l9-PB-0080 
151 
1 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Could I have 
2 
one question and then I will propose a way of 
3 
going forth which is we could like let the 
4 
program at least develop. 
So the Order that 
5 
is before Your Honor-- maybe that is the best 
6 
thing to do at this point -- the Order before 
7 
Your Honor is just to allow Ms. Feldman to be 
8 
engaged and Mr. Feinberg to really be engaged 
9 
to continue their work and to get a protocol 
10 
to bring to Your Honor to approve, but it 
11 
seems, I mean, I think I'm reading between the 
12 
lines that it seems that Your Honor is 
13 
speaking about maybe a cap on the amount that 
14 
you don't like the--maybe put a cap on the 
15 
amount. 
You don't like the infinite nature--
16 
I guess the way you are describing it. 
17 
THE COURT: 
Well, is there a 
18 
set of money that could be moved to fund this 
19 
program because, okay, you bring the protocol 
20 
to be approved, right? 
I approved the 
21 
protocol. 
You start working. You say 12 to 14 
22 
months from the time of the release this 
23 
person is to be paid, but then I have on the 
24 
other side what the People are dealing with in 
25 
the civil court. 

Probat e ST- 19- PB-0080 
152 
1 
2 
3 
And how I read the Statute, that 
lien can be in place for a period of six 
years. 
So now you've set up a program. 
4 
Persons, the victims come in, sign, release, 
5 
believe everything is in place. I think that 
6 
is where I am at. 
7 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: The problem with 
8 
that, Your Honor, is that-- I mean, I can let 
9 
the Plaintiff's Counsel address that-- that 
10 
will chill the program. 
11. 
THE COURT: I understand. 
12 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Let me just ask 
13 
a question so I understand so we can clarify 
14 
the point on this, okay? 
If the Attorney 
15 
General recovers, let's say one million 
16 
dollars from the estate, is that one million 
17 
dollars going to go to the budget of the 
18 
Virgin Islands or is it going to go to the 
19 
victims? 
If it's going to go to the victims, 
20 
I don't know why we can't bridge the gap and 
21 
get the Attorney General to be satisfied with 
22 
this program. 
23 
THE COURT: 
You know what I said 
24 
and it comes down maybe to the estate needs to 
25 
meet with the Attorney General. 

1 
2 
3 
to do that. 
Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
153 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: We're prepared 
THE COURT: 
I think I have said 
4 
that a couple of times. The estate may need to 
5 
mee 
with 
he 
ttorney Gener 1 , with the 
6 
victims, the claimants, Counsel here is saying 
7 
we are fully in support of this because the 
8 
only person we believe will be hurt by not 
9 
approving this program are the victims because 
10 
the victims either would have to go into 
11 
courts, right, expend monies for attorneys on 
12 
both sides when there's a program that is 
13 
going to be fully developed. They are saying 
14 
we can deal with these victims, fully resolve 
15 
the issues and have them compensated in 12 to 
16 
14 months. 
17 
Madam Attorney General, what 
18 
would you be willing to do on this point? 
19 
Release a portion of the estate just to fund 
20 
this program while you proceed with your 
21 
22 
23 
action? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: We can 
absolutely do have. 
We could do that 
24 
immediately and the only question I can ask, 
25 
Your Honor, I can hand up as an exhibit --it's 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
154 
1 
already in the court records, but Your Honor, 
2 
two copies. One I want you to have. It's not 
3 
really for the witness. 
4 
In the interim, we would just 
5 
like to move forward. No awards of money; no 
6 
release of money but to move this process 
7 
forward to complete the protocol which is 
8 
something that would come to you, Your Honor, 
9 
to approve, if that is what you want if you 
10 
want to exercise that jurisdiction over the 
11 
program. 
Otherwise, for the executors to 
12 
approve the protocol and be in a position to 
13 
move forward if in fact we can reach an 
14 
agreement with the Attorney General or 
15 
otherwise avoid what I think you call a freeze 
16 
of the program which obviously we don't want. 
17 
That Order will allow Ms. Feldman actually to 
18 
be gainfully employed again and to move 
19 
forward and for Mr . Feinberg to put i 
2 0 
together. 
21 
THE COURT: You are going to ask 
2 2 
me to sign this order now? 
23 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Yes, Your 
24 
25 
Honor, please. 
THE COURT: 
No, I don't believe 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
155 
1 
so. I haven't even seen what you had marked in 
2 
the exhibits and they have not been admitted. 
3 
You haven't moved for the admission. 
4 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I move for the 
5 
exhibits of 1 through 7. Eight is already in 
6 
the record. I thought I move a few of them in 
7 
before. 
8 
THE COURT: No, you haven't 
9 
because I never ruled. 
10 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I'd like to 
11 
move to enter into the record Exhibits 1 
12 
through 7. 
13 
THE COURT: They will be so 
14 
admitted. 
15 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Of course, Your 
16 
Honor, I just would want to say that I want to 
17 
put my objection on the record. 
18 
THE COURT: I'm not signing any 
19 
motion from the bench. Trust me on this. 
20 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
21 
I'm being urged to ask and I actually want to 
22 
ask it myself but I don t want to anger Your 
23 
Honor. 
I would very much like to call Mr. 
24 
Feinberg just to add es the Attorney 
25 
General's concern. 
It may help make progress, 

Pr obate ST-19- PB-0080 
1 
I think. 
2 
THE COURT: 
Call just him for 
3 
the limited purpose of that. I've gotten, I 
156 
4 
think, the claimants Counsel who was present 
5 
wanted to know the money. Attorney Benham, I 
6 
keep looking at you. 
You have that as part 
7 
of the record that now you can get copies of 
8 
that and then now the attorneys can be in a 
9 
better position to say, if I understood that, 
10 
that was their reservation, but I think maybe 
11 
you need to talk to the Attorney General, the 
12 
Government of the Virgin Islands, Department 
13 
of Justice as to his concerns. 
We now know 
14 
what the monies are. 
We now know what you are 
15 
seeking to set it up. 
16 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
17 
just so you understand that the executors are 
18 
trying to sort of move between a rock and a 
19 
hard place. 
What is difficult for the 
20 
executors is that the reason that there's no 
21 
quote/unquote cap on the program is to attract 
22 
claimants to the program and to avoid 
23 
criticisms from Plaintiff's Counsel that we 
24 
are given quote/unquote only X dollars. 
And 
25 
so we carefully avoided that and I understand 

Probate ST-L9~PB- OOBO 
157 
1 
that the Attorney General wants effectively a 
2 
cap and we'll work with the Attorney General 
3 
to try to get this done. 
4 
THE COURT: I don't think that is 
5 
what they want. The Attorney General to me is 
6 
just saying make sure whatever judgment they 
7 
may get-- right now, you know what? 
We have 
8 
two sets o f claims. 
We have a claim by the 
9 
Attorney General and the claimants. 
10 
The question is, does the 
11 
Attorney General lien take priority over 
12 
anything else done in the estate and I said 
13 
that is how I read it. 
Attorney Blum said 
14 
that 1s how he read it too, that it may stop 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
everything because the Attorney General has 
put a lien on all the property. I said, well, 
the estate has to continue to function. 
It 
has to pay its bills; it has to -- and 
Attorney Smith, I think, conceded that it may 
have basic administration costs, but this 1s 
different what you are asking this Court to do 
while I have this lien here. 
And this is what 
I am saying, why can't somebody guide the 
Court - whether Counsel submit memorandums of 
law -- no, it does not; we can proceed --

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
158 
1 
whether you can say we can back out this 
2 
amount, whatever is going on in the civil 
3 
court should not be affected; we believe the 
4 
estate, if the Attorney General, the 
5 
Government of the Virgin Islands was to 
6 
prevail, this will be the amount that they 
7 
would recover and so we can safely expend 
8 
these monies on this program, but remember the 
9 
question was because we don't have the 
10 
quarterly accountings, we don't have the full 
11 
evaluation. 
We don't know what the estate 
12 
consist of. 
13 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, I 
14 
understand. 
Can we start with Mr. Feinberg 
15 
just to address the subsequent concerns that 
16 
the Attorney General have with the program, if 
17 
I can call him? 
18 
THE COURT: Just call him quickly. 
19 
Thank you, Ms. Feldman. We have all exhibits 
20 
admitted? 
21 
Thereupon, KENNETH R. FEINBERG,

Q. 
Mr. Feinberg, before you were 
sworn in, I think you have all the exhibits in 
front of you so it would go much quicker. 
THE COURT: He's already sworn 
. 
in. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: He already 
sworn in? 
THE COURT: Yes, we were good on 
this one. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
Where do you live, Mr. Feinberg? 
Washington, DC. 
Did you come down here just to 
testify in this proceeding? 
A. 
I did. 
Q. 
Where are you employed? 
A. 
I'm the Law Office of Kenneth R. 
Feinberg, PC. 
Q. 
What do that firm do? 
A. 
We specialize in alternative 
dispute resolutions, mediations, arbitrations 
and claim programs like the one proposed. 
Q. 
Would you just describe briefly to 
Your Honor your experience in this matter? 
A. 
I started in 1984 with the Agent 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
160 
1 
Orange Vietnam veterans liability litigation 
2 
where we set up a program following the 
3 
settlement. I was appointed by the Bush 
4 
Administration to design and administer the 
5 
911 funds. 
I was appointed by the Obama 
6 
Administration to design and administer the 
7 
Deep Water Horizon Explosion and I'm currently 
8 
a co-administrator and designer of Catholic 
9 
Church sexual abuse cases in five states. 
10 
Q. 
Have you written any books? 
11 
A. 
I have written two; One is "Life 
12 
Worth". My experiences with the 911 Victim 
13 
Compensation Fund. And "Who Gets What", 
14 
chapters devoted to my various claim 
15 
administration programs. 
16 
Q. 
And is it fair to say that you are 
17 
regarded as either the best or one of the best 
18 
people in dealing with these sorts of 
19 
complicated multiple claimant filings? 
20 
A. 
That is for others to say. I'm 
21 
busy at it. 
22 
Q. 
Will you disagree with Ms. Feldman 
23 
on that? 
24 
25 
A. 
No. 
Q. 
Do you have a role in this 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
Piobat e ST- 19- PB- 0080 
program, the Epstein Victim Compensation 
Program? 
A. 
Yes. 
I have been asked by the 
161 
estate to work with Ms. Feldman and Ms. Biros 
in the design, implementation and 
administration of a proposed program. 
Q. 
Do you believe the program would 
8 
work if the Court approves it? 
9 
10 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And are you familiar with the 
11 
oppositions to the estate motion for 
12 
establishment of a voluntary claims resolution 
13 
program fi l ed basically last Friday by 
14 
Attorney General Denise George?

A. 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
A. 
Yes. 
Have you reviewed 't? 
l 
. 
I have. 
What do you think of 
The Attorney General 
't? 
l 
. 
is trying 
20 
do what i s best for the Virgin Islands. I 
to 
21 
can't question that. There are statements made 
22 
in the Complaint that I disagree with, and I 
23 
agree with the Court sitting up back that the 
24 
estate and the Attorney General should be able 
25 
to work this out. 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
162 
1 
Q. 
And I direct your attention to 
2 
Page 1 of the Opposition. It says, quote, the 
3 
program does not secure the Government's 
4 
substantial and legally protectable interest 
5 
in the appropriate and supervised distribution 
6 
of the estate's assets. 
7 
What's your understanding of 
8 
whose ro 
it should be to , quo e , supervise 
9 
the 
i s ribution of the es ate's assets? 
10 
A. 
The Government has an interest. 
11 
It's the executor's role. 
There's no reason 
12 
you can't set up this program and administer 
13 
it to the satisfaction of the Government, I 
14 
think, as we've done in other programs with 
15 
the Government of the United States or states 
16 
that have studied the program and gone along 
17 
with the proposal. 
18 
Q. 
Okay. On Page 3 of the Attorney 
19 
General's letter, she notes that Virgin 
20 
Islands law entitles victims of crimes to be 
21 
treated with dignity and compassion, to be 
22 
protected from intimidation, to be informed of 
23 
their legal rights and to receive reparations 
24 
for -physical and emotional injuries suffered 
25 
as a result of being a victim of a violent 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
163 
1 
bodily crime. 
2 
Breaking that down, how many 
3 
claimants have made themselves known, roughly, 
4 
to the program so far? 
5 
A. 
I think it's probably either known 
6 
or in anticipation from talk with Plaintiff's 
7 
lawyer, probably about fifty. There may be 
8 
more. 
Once you announce a program, they will 
9 
be gilded and they will come. 
But the goals 
10 
set out in the Attorney General's Complaint is 
11 
exactly the goal of this program - to satisfy 
12 
the Attorney General and the estate and 
13 
especially the victims in getting them prompt 
14 
compensation. 
15 
Q. 
To date are any of the claimants 
16 
that have come forward, US Virgin Islands 
17 
residents that you know of? 
18 
A. 
I'm not aware of any. I don't 
19 
know. 
20 
Q. 
And Ms. George says, quote, under 
21 
the framework of the fund, there's no 
22 
obligation that the program Administrator be 
23 
subj ect--wi thdrawn. 
24 
On Page 4, on the long part of 
25 
Page 4, Ms. George notes that the programs 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
164 
1 
design, quote, would be in part determined by 
2 
an undefined group of those with an interest 
3 
in resolution of the sexual abuse claims made 
4 
by Mr. Epstein's victims, and she complains 
5 
that, quote, this group could include any 
6 
number of individuals and entities, close 
7 
quote. 
8 
Who actually designed the 
9 
program to the extent it's designed so far? 
10 
A. 
The protocol was very transparent. 
11 
The Administrator will be Jordana Feldman; the 
12 
program has been designed by Ms. Biros and 
13 
myself. It's been submitted to both the estate 
14 
lawyers and the executor and it's been 
15 
submitted to very distinguished Plaintiff 
16 
Counsel. 
17 
They have commented; we've 
18 
redlined it; we are still reviewing it; but it 
19 
is a very transparent process designed to get 
20 
eligible claimants fast compensation. 
21 
Q. 
Without restating what Ms. George 
22 
said, do you understand that in administering 
23 
the program, Ms. Feldman, you, and Ms. Biros 
24 
will be subjected to the supervision and 
25 
approval of this Court? 

Probate ST- 19- eB-0080 
165 
A. 
That's my understanding. 
1 
2 
Q. 
And do you understand that we are 
3 
here because we sought the approval of the 
4 
Court. 
We just didn't do it, right? 
5 
6 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And once you developed the 
7 
protocol, is it the plan of the executors and 
8 
the funds administrators, independent though -
9 
we do communicate - is there a joint plan to 
10 
come back to the Court with the protocol for 
11 
12 
13 
14 
Your 
going 
Honor, 
A. 
Q. 
to be 
for the judge's 
approval? 
That is my understanding. 
And that happens before a cent 
paid out of the fund? 
15 
A. 
That's my understanding. 
lS 
16 
Q. 
And I asked Ms. Feldman a bunch of 
17 
questions about would she listen to the 
18 
Attorney General, has she heard from the 
19 
Attorney General. 
I take it not only will the 
20 
Co-Executors be willing to speak with the 
21 
Attorney General, but you, Ms. Feldman, Ms. 
22 
Biros, etcetera, will be willing to take her 
23 
input? 
24 
A. 
Whatever the Attorney General 
25 
wants. 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
166 
1 
Q. 
Okay. 
On Page 4, the Attorney 
2 
General also complains that the Epstein 
3 
--well, the program, quote, fails to specify 
4 
what constitutes a sexual assault and who 
5 
qualifies as a claimant. 
6 
What in your experience is the 
7 
program--what constitutes sexual assault i n 
8 
this program? 
9 
A. 
The submission by a Plaintiff's 
10 
lawyer or prose claimant claiming that the 
11 
alleged victim was abused in various ways, 
12 
minimally to very, very extensively, here are 
13 
all the circumstances given rise to that 
14 
sexual 
abuse and the administrator will make 
15 
a determination as to eligibility and as to 
16 
the amount, if eligible, the amount of money 
17 
that will be proffered or offered to that 
18 
claimant. 
19 
Q. 
It sounds like a whole bunch of 
20 
questions. 
Is it fair to say that it's an 
21 
extremely low bar for a person or her counsel 
22 
to come forward and to participate in the 
23 
program and then have a dialogue with the 
24 
program about what is just compensation? 
25 
A. 
Yes, it is. 
Much lower than a 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
167 
1 
court 
of law. 
2 
Q. 
And Ms. George expresses concern 
3 
that, quote, children who were sexually abused 
4 
by Mr. Epstein may mistakenly believe that 
5 
they consented to this assault and may not 
6 
recognize their eligibility for compensation. 
7 
Of those that you're familiar 
8 
with who has come forward, do any of them 
9 
allege that they were minors when Mr. Epstein 
10 
sexually abused them? 
11 
A. 
I'm not aware of individual claims 
12 
at this stage. 
13 
Q. 
Combining a number of concerns 
14 
that Ms. George has, why is there a window and 
15 
a deadline and why does the program not just 
16 
go on forever? 
I know Ms. Feldman addressed 
17 
that, but can I hear from you? 
18 
A. 
You can't have a program like this 
19 
go on forever. It's not good for claimants. 
20 
In the 911 fund, two thirds of all the 
21 
claimants arrived and filed a claim in the 
22 
last ninety days of a 33-month program. If you 
23 
do not have a deadline, people procrastinate. 
24 
It's human nature. 
25 
So we try and set up a timeline 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
168 
1 
that will provide claimants and their Counsel 
2 
ample opportunity to file claims. We have 
3 
discussed this, not only with the estate, but 
4 
with the various lawyers representing 
5 
claimants. 
6 
Q. 
And if a claimant missed that 
7 
window, will they still have recourse to the 
8 
courts? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
to 
in 
to 
A. 
Not only will 
the courts, but as you 
certain circumstances, 
allow a late filing. 
Q. 
On Page 5 of 
they have recourse 
may understand, we, 
will bend the rules 
her letter, Ms. 
14 
George urges that, quote, any program proposed 
15 
to compensate Mr. Epstein's victims should 
16 
counsel 
the psychological trauma of minors 
17 
who often repress memories of their abuse by 
18 
allowing them additional time for filing a 
19 
claim instead of limiting time for filing. Do 
20 
you feel the program give enough time? 
21 
A. 
I think so and I agree with that 
22 
statement, but I think that a nine-month 
23 
program, as the word gets out, we should be 
24 
able to get all eligible claimants to file. 
25 
Q. 
And you just covered this but in 

Probate ST-1 9- PB- 0 080 
169 
1 
your experience, the programs have cutoffs and 
2 
then there is some flexibility that the 
3 
administrator has to try to loop people in who 
4 
for whatever reason has missed the time? 
5 
A. 
In the 911 Victim Compensation 
6 
Fund, 97% of all eligible claimants filed. In 
7 
the GM Ignition Switch Traumatic Car Accident 
8 
Program, over 95% filed and in all of these 
9 
church sexual abuse cases, the overwhelming 
10 
number, well in excess of 95%, filed within 
11 
the deadline. 
12 
Q. 
On Page 5, Ms. George continues 
13 
and says, quote, the evidence requirement 
14 
could potentially exclude deserving claimants, 
15 
close quote, and says there's concern that the 
16 
program will exclude victims or claimants who 
17 
may be unable to document their claims. What's 
18 
your reaction to that? 
19 
A. 
That's a very legitimate concern. 
20 
We think the way the protocol was drafted and 
21 
the procedures that have been drafted will 
22 
satisfy the Attorney General that we won't 
23 
find eligible claimants deemed ineligible and 
24 
that is a very real concern of ours in 
25 
drafting the protocol. 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
170 
1 
Q. 
I mean, that's a very fine point I 
2 
asked. It's not really clear to me whether the 
3 
Attorney General is concerned about finding 
4 
too many people eligible or finding too many 
5 
people ineligible. 
6 
I mean the goal of the program, 
7 
right, is to figure out the people who are 
8 
truly eligible and to accurately figure out 
9 
what is just compensation? 
10 
A. 
Correct. 
11 
Q. 
That's the whole game, right? 
12 
13 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Okay. We covered the concern about 
14 
being forced to come to New York or not being 
15 
heard. 
If need be, could you envision corning 
16 
down here, I guess you or Ms. Feldman coming 
17 
down here if there's enough people here and 
18 
meeting with claimants? 
19 
A. 
Absolutely. 
Don't forget, what 
20 
these people often want as much as 
21 
compensation, if not more, is validation, is 
22 
acknowledgment, the opportunity to be heard 
23 
and this is something that is a very important 
24 
voluntary aspect of the program. 
25 
Q. 
Ms. George complains that the 

rrobate ST-19-eB-0080 
171 
1 
program, quote, contains no assurances that 
2 
the information submitted by a claimant cannot 
3 
be later used against her if she thereafter 
4 
decides to file suit against the estate or any 
5 
other co-defendant. 
6 
Is that criticism grounded in 
7 
the 
way you see the program? 
8 
A. 
No. 
No. The protocol expressly 
9 
secures the confidentiality of anything 
10 
provided by the claimant. The claimant, and 
11 
the claimant alone, decides the extent of 
12 
transparency or disclosure - not the program, 
13 
not the administrator, or the estate. 
14 
Q. 
A few more, on Page 6,there's a 
15 
concern that notes, quote, the program 
16 
provides no protection to claimants who 
17 
voluntarily provide information that may later 
18 
be used to defend the estate from claims or 
19 
provides evidence against other victims. Does 
20 
the program work that way? 
21 
A. 
No. The program seals all the 
22 
information and various common law and 
23 
statutorial privileges apply. We've seen that 
24 
in these other programs - attorney-client, 
25 
etcetera; settlement discussions, etcetera 

Pr obate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
172 
1 
Q. 
Is one thing clear between you and 
2 
the executor's and their counsel that you are 
3 
independent, right? 
4 
A. 
That's right. When the estate 
5 
approached me --and the Court asked this 
6 
question a little earlier. 
7 
When the estate approached me 
8 
and I recommended Ms. Feldman and Ms. Biros, I 
9 
had certain preconditions based on my 
10 
experience. 
11 
One: Once the program is up and 
12 
running, any decision made by Ms. Feldman as 
13 
the Administrator is independent and may not 
14 
be challenged by the estate. 
15 
Second pre-condition, I asked 
16 
the estate point blank, is there enough money 
17 
in the program to indemnify all eligible 
18 
claimants and the expressed answer I received 
19 
from the estate is absolutely. 
There are 
20 
sufficient funds in the estate to provide 
21 
eligible claimants with generous compensation 
22 
without resort to any cap or any artificial 
23 
ceiling placed on an individual award. 
24 
Now, I reminded the estate that 
25 
in the 911 fund the compensation ranged from 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
173 
1 
$250,000 a claim. 
We had a few claims in 
2 
excess of five million dollars. In the GM 
3 
Ignition Switch programs, the claims ranged 
4 
from about $100,000 to a few million dollars 
5 
and I wanted to be satisfied that in designing 
6 
this protocol, the estate had suffici ent 
7 
assets-- not only to fund the infrastructure, 
8 
the budget, but albeit, 
sufficient funds 
9 
without a cap for the administrator to f und in 
10 
some cases perhaps multi-million dollar 
11 
awards. The estate has assured me and Ms. 
1.2 
Feldman that there are sufficient funds so 
13 
that any reasonable program with maybe fifty 
14 
or one hundred, maybe more claimants, there 
15 
will be claimants that will received, I 
16 
suspect, multi- million dollar awards and there 
17 
would be claimants deemed ineligible because 
18 
Ms. Feldman is correct that when you build one 
19 
of these programs, there will be certain 
20 
claimants who will file and will be found 
21 
ineligible . 
22 
So in response to the Court, 
23 
I can't say yet without examining the claims 
24 
whether the average claim will be one hundred 
25 
thousand dollars, a million dollars, two 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
174 
1 
million dollars but the protocol anticipates 
2 
any claimant deemed eligible can be valued by 
3 
the Administrator without regard to limited 
4 
funds. 
5 
Some other plaintiffs' counsel 
6 
raised this; I've raised this with David 
7 
Boies; 
I've raised this with Brad Edwards; 
8 
I've raised this with other Plaintiff's 
9 
counsel. 
There is no cap and Plaintiff's 
10 
Counsel have been assured that they should 
11 
participate in this program. 
12 
Q. 
Directing your attention to when 
13 
Ms. George says on Page 7 of her letter, 
14 
quote, the range of compensation must be 
15 
available to claimants before filing. 
It goes 
16 
on to say, quote, the potential range of 
17 
compensation available for each claim should 
18 
be provided in advance, close quote. 
19 
Based on your experience, is 
20 
that the way you generally develop the 
21 
protocol? 
22 
A. 
Can't be. Until we examine the 
23 
claims and the allegations and the 
24 
circumstantial evidence of abuse, you can't 
25 
begin to anticipate variations among 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
175 
1 
claimants. You can't develop a public matrix 
2 
that will, I think, raise false expectations 
3 
as to what the ranges would be. 
There's a 
4 
certain degree of discretion that the 
5 
independent administrator must have once 
6 
reviewing the entire file to determine 
7 
eligible compensation. 
8 
Q. 
If the claimant wishes, this 
9 
includes an interview with Ms. Feldman, 
10 
correct? 
11 
A. 
At the claimant's option. 
Not 
12 
required. 
Failure to request a hearing won't 
13 
adversely impact the administrator. That's 
14 
something that the claimant must decide with 
15 
his or her lawyer. 
16 
Q. 
A few more. On Page 6, Ms. George 
17 
says, quote, the absence of clear and precise 
18 
parameters for inclusion or exclusion in the 
19 
program fails to provide appropriate guidance 
20 
to ensure potential claimants will not be left 
21 
out. Specifically, without clear criteria, 
22 
potential claimants neither have the 
23 
information or confidence to approach the 
24 
fund. 
25 
We've been over this, basically, 

Probate ST-19-PB~OOBO 
176 
1 
you believe you've been sexually abused and 
2 
you show up, that is sufficient? 
I mean, do 
3 
you feel there is a need for more 
4 
infrastructure at the front end? 
5 
A. 
In the draft protocol that we 
6 
hope to finalize with the approval of this 
7 
Court, we lay out in some pretty clear 
8 
language the criteria that the administrator 
9 
looks at. It's similar to what we're looking 
10 
at now in the Catholic Church sexual abuse 
11 
cases in five states. It's basically that type 
12 
of criteria. It's not exclusive but we think 
13 
that provides the claimant, and I think the 
14 
Attorney General, with a pretty good blueprint 
15 
of what Ms. Feldman will be looking at in 
16 
administering this voluntary program. 
17 
Q. 
Ms. George makes the statement 
18 
that the program administrator's ability to 
19 
award compensation, quote, makes it less 
20 
likely that each claimant receives the 
21 
compensation to which she is fairly and 
22 
impartially entitled. 
Your view on that? 
23 
A. 
Well, I just said that is not 
24 
true. 
As long as there's no cap on the 
25 
program, as long as Administrator Feldman can 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
177 
1 
render an independent decision as to each 
2 
claim without regard to any cap, based on the 
3 
state's representations, I don't think any 
4 
eligible claimant is going to be shortchanged 
5 
by the number of eligible claimants. 
6 
Q. 
So far, I just want to ask you, do 
7 
you agree that one of the themes that the 
8 
Attorney General is pointing towards is 
9 
concern that any claimant will somehow be 
10 
disadvantaged, not receive enough 
11 
consideration, there might be a cap on what 
12 
they may get. 
In other words concern that 
13 
people would come forward and state that they 
14 
have been victimized and become claimants, 
15 
they need to be treated as well as possible? 
16 
A. 
I think that's right. 
I think 
17 
it's a fair concern but I think the protocol 
18 
addresses that concern and ensures that each 
19 
claimant will receive an independent valuation 
20 
without regard to available, other available 
21 
funds. 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Q. 
You've already addressed this, but 
the demand that Ms. George makes on Page 7 is 
that the program, quote, should disclose any 
limits on the amounts of compensation 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
1 
individually or collectively - speaking of 
2 
compensation to claimants. 
3 
In your view, should those 
178 
4 
amounts be disclosed? 
You know, married to an 
5 
identifier of the claimant? 
In other words, 
6 
Cl aimant named A,B,C receives X,Y,Z? 
7 
A. 
No. I don't think claimants in 
8 
particular, claimants in particular don't want 
9 
amounts that they've received to be disclosed 
10 
and the protocol spells out expressly that 
11 
there is no cap or no limit on the amount of 
12 
individual compensation. 
13 
Q. 
Right. She says the quote 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
addresses disclosing limits. 
You don't want a 
l imit? 
A. 
That's right. 
Q. 
If a claimant doesn't like the 
compensation award she receives, can she 
reject it? 
A. 
Of course, very few do if we do 
our job right, but the answer is yes. 
Q. 
I was just going to ask you, in 
your experience with just a couple of the 
funds that you've run, what has been the 
acceptance rate exactly? 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
179 
1 
A. 
All of the funds that I've 
2 
administered, the acceptance rate is above 90% 
3 
and that's because the programs have very 
4 
quick -- I think Ms. Feldman was a little 
5 
guarded. 
I think in this program since it's 
6 
been delayed in up and running, I think the 
7 
compensation decisions once made, people will 
8 
be paid within a week and I'll be very 
9 
surprised --it will be a first --if we don't 
10 
have the vast number of eligible claimants 
11 
paid quickly. 
12 
Q. 
And then are you---well, Ms. 
13 
George said that --this is on Page 7 again. 
14 
There is a lot on Page 7. 
She says, quote, 
15 
the waiver of requirement is unjust 
16 
referring to the waiver requirement that, I 
17 
think this is what she is terming the 
18 
waiver--that if somebody receives 
19 
compensation, she must give a global release. 
20 
Do you view that as unjust or necessary? 
21 
A. 
I don't view it as unjust. 
It's a 
22 
voluntary program. If the claimant and her 
23 
lawyer don't feel that the compensation that's 
24 
offered by Ms. Feldman is fai r or just or 
25 
reasonable, they opt out and continue to 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
180 
1 
litigate or pursue other remedies. 
2 
Q. 
Is the estate vulnerable to third 
3 
party claims and how does that work if, in 
4 
fact, the estate does not receive a general 
5 
release from a compensated claimant? 
6 
A. 
That's a very interesting 
7 
provocative question raised by the Attorney 
8 
General and others. 
And as Ms. Feldman stated 
9 
earlier, the scope of the release has not yet 
10 
been finalized. The estate has to make a 
11 
decision. Does it want total peace? 
12 
Ms. Feldman, you will pay what 
13 
ever is necessary to secure a comprehensive 
14 
release so we won't be cross-claimed by a 
15 
claimant or alternatively now, if a claimant 
16 
wants to release the estate but litigate 
17 
against X or Y, that is up to the claimant. 
18 
So that is a critical issue and 
19 
you can argue both ways and I think that the 
20 
estate and the administrator and the 
21 
plaintiffs' lawyers are discussing that at 
22 
this time. 
23 
24 
25 
Q. 
Page 8, Ms. George complains that 
the program, quote, does not specify whether 
the administrator is permitted or required to 

181 
1 
share evidence with law enforcement, thus 
2 
positioning the program as a potential means 
3 
to conceal criminal activity, close quote~ I 
4 
take it that wasn't an accusation that you're 
5 
trying to conceal anything, but in any event, 
6 
what's your view on that? 
7 
A. 
In the forty years that I've 
8 
designed and administered these programs, law 
9 
enforcement has never sought to secure any 
10 
civil confidential information. 
11 
In the church cases, the 
12 
Attorney General of various states have come 
13 
to us and said, you know, you have a lot of 
14 
information about wrongdoings by Clergy and we 
15 
refused to--we work out with the Attorney 
16 
General, go see the diocese or the Church. 
17 
Don't come to a program where claimants, 
18 
individual victims have participated in a 
19 
program on the absolute guarantee of the 
20 
administrator that information that have been 
21 
submitted will not be disclosed to anybody. 
22 
And that is a very important part of this. 
23 
Claimants do not want information disclosed. 
24 
Q. 
The program, would it respect that 
25 
wish of claimants? 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
182 
A. 
It's expressly spelled out in the 
protocol, yes. 
Q. 
And they can still go to law 
enforcement. Period. 
Full stop. It's up to 
them? 
A. 
It's up to them and they can go 
7 
public. That's up to them. 
The estate cannot. 
8 
The administrator cannot. 
9 
Q. 
On Page 8, Ms. George says that 
10 
the program, quote, presents an unavoidable 
11 
conflicts of interest, close quote, between 
12 
the executors and the program. She said, the 
13 
Co-Executors have, quote, an inescapable 
14 
conflict of interest in recommending a program 
15 
that proposes to compensate any individual or 
16 
entity making such allegations requiring in 
17 
return overly broad releases. Do you have a 
18 
view on this? 
19 
A. 
You have to ask the estate on 
20 
that. I can tell you that before we agreed to 
21 
take on this assignment, Ms. Feldman and 
22 
myself and Ms. Biros, we have received 
23 
absolute assurances from the estate that they 
24 
will play no role in the day-to-day 
25 
administration of this program. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
183 
1 
Q. 
Okay. So when it comes to the time 
2 
to set what is viewed as just compensation for 
3 
claimants anywhere, for me, my clients, one of 
4 
the Co-Executors, other counsel, zeror right? 
S 
A. 
No. Zero. 
6 
Q. 
And in terms of your 
7 
understanding, just from your long experience 
8 
of the Co-Executors, in viewing them so far, 
9 
do you view them there as exercising their 
10 
fiduciary duty appropriately? 
11 
A. 
In this case? 
12 
Q. 
In this program? 
13 
A. 
Very much so. The estate has made 
14 
it clear from day one they want to create an 
15 
independent claims program to quickly and 
16 
efficiently resolve these sexual abuse claims 
17 
against the estate in a manner that is 
18 
efficient, cost effective and satisfies their 
19 
fiduciary duties. 
20 
There have been no problems. They 
21 
have worked closely with us as have the 
22 
Plaintiff's lawyers in designing and 
23 
implementing this program. 
24 
Q. 
And Ms. George goes on to say on 
25 
Page 9 that,quote, disclosure of conflicts is 

P~obat e ST-19-PB-0080 
184 
1 
critical to allow the Court to evaluate the 
2 
ability of the program to engage in error and 
3 
impartial arms length negotiations or 
4 
resolutions. 
5 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, if I 
6 
may, Counsel is referring to a letter; there's 
7 
no letter that's before the Court that's from 
8 
the Attorney General. He's referring to a 
9 
motion. It's not a letter. There's no 
10 
communication with the Attorney General to the 
11 
12 
estate. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Sorry. 
13 
THE COURT: I've been reading along 
14 
on the Motion. 
15 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK= It's in the 
16 
mot·on , Your Honor . I have been referring to 
17 
it as a letter. Thank you very much. 
18 
By Attorney Tornback : 
19 
Q. 
So let's assume there is a 
20 
conflict in some way that the Executor has 
21 
with something-- I don't know what. Would that 
22 
matter in terms of the determination that the 
23 
program makes? 
24 
A. 
No. Under the protocol and under 
25 
the agreement, once this program is up and 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
185 
1 
running, Ms. Feldman examines every claim and 
2 
makes an independent judgment as to 
3 
eligibility first and valuation second. 
4 
Q. 
And the next to the last, we've 
5 
covered the concern about undisclosed costs 
6 
and the budget and the engagement letter. 
So 
7 
I want to address that. 
8 
The last thing on Page 9 that Ms. 
9 
George asserts the program as proposed, quote, 
10 
offers no reconciliation or accountability 
11 
because, quote, there's no disclosure of Mr. 
12 
Epstein's conduct, the number of victims or 
13 
the amount of awards paid. 
14 
Does the program in anyway 
15 
discourage disclosure of Mr. Epstein's or 
16 
anybody's conduct related to him? 
17 
A. 
No. This program is about 
18 
compensating victims quickly. 
Whether or not 
19 
there's criminal activity or criminal 
20 
investigation or what have you, this program 
21 
is focused strictly on determining eligible 
22 
compensation and paying those victims who 
23 
have waited so long for compensation. 
24 
Q. 
Besides the specific identify, 
25 
will the number of victims, the amount of 

Probate ST-19-eB- 0080 
1 
awards paid by the program be disclosed and 
2 
provided to the Court for its review? 
3 
A. 
You'll have to ask the estate 
4 
that. I'm assuming that there would be some 
5 
degree of obligation on the part of the 
186 
6 
administrator to keep the Court i nformed about 
7 
the progress and scope of the program. 
8 
Q. 
If this program does not go 
9 
forward in real speed, in real time, in your 
10 
view based on your experience with similar 
11 
programs, what is the likely outcome? 
12 
A. 
It will be a tragedy. It will be a 
13 
tragedy not to quickly try and compensate as 
14 
many victims as come forward who are eligible. 
15 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, I 
16 
welcome any questions you may have of Mr. 
17 
Feinberg. I'm done. 
18 
THE COURT: I don't believe the 
19 
concern is o 
the p ogram an 
what the program 
20 
is designed to accomplish or whether the 
21 
persons who have been engaged to design this 
22 
program have the experience, knowledge and can 
2 3 
get it done. 
24 
No one has addressed for me --and 
25 
I keep coming back to that --I'm still at I go 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
187 
1 
forward with the program and how do I do that 
2 
with what the Government of the Virgin Islands 
3 
has filed because the program requires a 
4 
significant expenditure of monies, right, and 
5 
it is the victims come in, I understand you 
6 
would like a quick turn around, but victims 
7 
could have awards of millions of dollars and 
8 
then the Government of the Virgin Islands is 
9 
here saying the estate has been dissipated. 
10 
We've proceeded with the 
11 
program; you knew we had this lien; assets of 
12 
the estate were converted to cash to satisfy 
13 
the claims. That ' s where I am. 
I never had 
14 
any concerns about the program and how the 
15 
program would work. 
16 
And as the claimant's counsel 
17 
who were present said everybody agrees the 
18 
program is what they want. 
They just wanted 
19 
to know what is the money to establish the 
20 
program. We now have a budget and now we have 
21 
that the awards can be any amount depending on 
22 
how the victim presents what she is able to or 
23 
can show the administrator, but we still come 
24 
back to this lien on everything of the estate. 
25 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
188 
1 
we'll speak to it right now. 
2 
THE COURT: Yes. 
3 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: But can I just 
4 
point out one last thing before we do that. If 
5 
you look at the prayer for relief of the 
6 
Attorney General, correct, I mean it basically 
7 
summarizes that the Attorney General wants all 
8 
the money. 
9 
THE COURT: Yes, I got that. She 
10 
wants everything. 
11 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: But the Attorney 
12 
General, in her Complaint and in her Motion To 
13 
Intervene has put forth--I think the witnesses 
14 
have been completely clear--it's sort of--I 
15 
don't think intentionally --but sort of fake 
16 
facts about the program. 
I just want to put 
17 
the cap on that. 
18 
THE COURT: Okay. 
19 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I don't 
20 
understand why the Attorney General ~stalking 
21 
about the program and why the Attorney General 
22 
is even criticizing the program. 
If she's 
23 
basically just saying I want to take all the 
24 
money, right, and I want to deny the victims 
25 
the right to the program and I want to try to 

1 
2 
Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
gum up the entire estate, well, sure, we'll 
talk to the Attorney General. 
I don't 
189 
3 
underst~nd, but we'll grapple with the merits 
4 
of her claim but the merits of her criticisms 
5 
w· h 
he program is why M. Feinberg is here 
6 
and Ms. Feldman and I'm asking questions and 
7 
why the Plaintiffs, I presume, are defending 
8 
the program. I'm just saying they don't have 
9 
any merit and I want to move on. 
10 
THE COURT: You talked to the 
11 
Attorney General. 
I let you address the 
12 
Attorney General's concern. 
My concern was 
13 
how much money are we talking about to fund 
14 
the program for this Court to approve and you 
15 
say to the executors, you can fund this 
16 
program; 
you can set this up, right. 
I 
17 
didn't go into the merits of the program 
18 
because I have where all the claims that are 
19 
filed, everybody said they support the 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
program. 
The issue is, and I keep bringing 
it back, is how does this Court fund this 
program if I have what the Attorney General 
has set an action in process in the civil 
court and has filed a lien that says you 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
190 
1 
cannot use any assets of the estate? 
2 
Wouldn't I have to move 
3 
significant assets over to this program if you 
4 
are going to compensate victims within 12 to 
5 
14 days? 
That's what it is. 
6 
But you're saying the Attorney 
7 
General, whether or not she's not compensating 
8 
any particular vie ims , s e is seeking to 
9 
compensate the People of the Virgin Islands 
10 
that is her client. That is who she 
11 
12 
represents. 
Now, if you want to go over to 
13 
the civil court and say she has no merits to 
14 
say I should take what the estate has, that 
15 
the People can't show why she should be 
16 
entitled to that --and I see it in the 
17 
complaint - - an 
I did have the Complaint 
18 
before me. 
19 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Well, to be 
20 
honest, I don't want to get into the merits 
21 
but it's not quite as simple as the Attorney 
22 
General might think. 
23 
THE COURT: But that is not for me 
24 
25 
to determine, right? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Right. 

Proba te ST-19-PB- 0080 
191 
1 
THE COURT: Another Judge is going 
2 
to handle that. 
3 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: What I want to 
4 
say are two things. 
One, in terms of what 
5 
the Attorney General can do here, you know, 
6 
t here are other law enforcement authorities. 
7 
There is a house in New York; there's a ranch 
8 
in New Mexico; and it will be a shame if the 
9 
Attorney General, as I understand it, has not 
10 
been in contact with the United States 
11 
Attorney General for the Southern District of 
12 
New York which still has the active 
13 
investigation going. 
It would be a shame if 
14 
we have a battle between law enforcement 
15 
agencies and it destroys the ability of the 
16 
estate to address the vict ims. 
17 
Your Honor, I just want to say 
18 
on my own behalf that I hope that the Attorney 
19 
General, through the presentation of Ms. 
20 
Feldman and Mr. Feinberg that she could at 
21 
l east claim to be interested in the victims 
22 
and I think that we have tried to make a case 
23 
to her here that this is a good program that 
24 
will help the victims. 
25 
So hopefully we can make some 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
192 
1 
progress in figuring out how much the Attorney 
2 
General needs in terms of cash in the estate 
3 
to let the program go forward. 
4 
THE COURT: 
Maybe that is what you 
5 
have to talk to the Attorney ·General about. 
6 
That is why I keep saying maybe the estate 
7 
needs to talk to the Attorney General and the 
8 
Attorney General will say, you know what? 
I 
9 
filed this lien, but maybe I will release so 
10 
much to fund the program, but to me, the 
11 
Attorney General has taken a lien on 
12 
everything this estate has. 
13 
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honor, may I be 
14 
heard just in response? 
15 
THE COURT: Sir? 
16 
THE WITNESS: This has happened 
17 
occasionally in other programs that I've 
18 
designed. 
19 
THE COURT: Okay. Somebody help me. 
20 
THE WITNESS: For example, 
21 
sometimes the Government says we're interested 
22 
in seizing or freezing the assets because we 
23 
want to make sure that through restitution and 
24 
civil and criminal fines there will be enough 
25 
money available from the estate to compensate 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
193 
1 
eligible victims. 
2 
Well, in this program, I would 
3 
hope based on the testimony that the AG of the 
4 
Virgin Islands will see no reason to freeze 
5 
for purposes of restitution and fines owing to 
6 
the victims because the victims, under the 
7 
estate plan, will be compensated quickly 
8 
without regard to the public in ervening . 
9 
And 
he second point I think 
10 
you've made very very clear. 
In my experience 
11 
that if the estate and distinguished Counsel 
12 
sit down with the Attorney General now that 
13 
the Attorney General has a better 
14 
understanding, I think, of the program that 
15 
Your Honor has elicited from the testimony, I 
16 
would like to think that the Attorney General 
17 
and distinguished Counsel shall be able to 
18 
work out a solution for these women, the 
19 
innocent victims of this delay. 
That's the 
20 
real dilemma here. 
21 
THE COURT: 
Right. 
And that's 
22 
what I am saying because, right, if we have 
23 
the lien and it's a question of, remember we 
24 
said we have to go and research it, what is 
25 
that lien? 
That lien seems to take everything 

Probate ST-19-eB- 0080 
194 
1 
because it begins with the estate and all 
2 
these assets are sitting in the estate held by 
3 
the decedent, right, of these corporations, 
4 
all the shares and all these shares, the 
5 
corporations own the real property. So title 
6 
is in the decedent. 
7 
So the Attorney General has come 
8 
in and she put a lien on all that property. 
9 
Even if I wanted to fund that program, what 
10 
could I safely move over to that program that 
11 
doesn't impact what I've now been put on 
12 
notice there's nothing that I can transfer. 
13 
And so I think we now understand 
14 
the program and I thank you for your testimony 
15 
and Ms. Feldman. 
We now understand the 
16 
program better, right, not just on paper but 
17 
understanding how it will work through your 
18 
testimony. 
19 
Claimants attorneys have heard 
20 
the testimony on how this program is designed 
21 
to work. We may just need to tweak with the 
22 
development of the release, the protocol has 
23 
been changed in some way. 
Can it be that this 
24 
Court can safely, with the consent of the 
25 
Attorney General, move so much money into that 

Probate ST-19-PB-OO BO 
195 
1 
program to then allow that program to proceed 
2 
to start compensating the victims/claimants in 
3 
the manner in which Counsel present want it 
4 
done without impacting what the Attorney 
5 
General believes she has to do as her legal 
6 
representative of the People of the Virgin 
7 
Islands? 
Can that be something that can be 
8 
done? 
9 
I've heard it all today, but I 
10 
keep saying, I have this lien. 
I know she 
11 
opposes--and you know what? 
I don't even 
12 
think the Attorney General has to go to oppose 
13 
the program. 
All she had to do is file a 
14 
lien; you're stopped. I filed a lien and 
15 
you're stopped, right? 
16 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: But just to 
17 
put a fine point on this, Your Honor, and Mr. 
18 
Feinberg used the word tragic; I would use the 
19 
word waste. 
But if a terrible waste if the 
20 
way in which the Court views its jurisdiction 
21 
and the Attorney General views its 
22 
responsibilities, we'll see the estate really 
23 
getting, and able to pay for litigation and 
24 
ultimately probable able to pay for claims 
25 
simply because there are enough assets in the 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
196 
1 
United States to pay for those claims, but to 
2 
go down that road and not be able to fund the 
3 
program which is a much better option, I think 
4 
for all. 
So we will work with the Attorney 
5 
General to get something done. 
6 
THE COURT: I keep thinking you 
7 
are missing what I am saying. She has taken a 
8 
lien on the entire estate. 
She's not taking a 
9 
lien on Little St. James only. She's taking a 
10 
lien on the entire estate and say no assets 
11 
can be taken out and her lien is a priority 
12 
lien. It specifically says nothing can be 
13 
taken out so if I approve the funding of the 
14 
program, you start talking, the claimant's 
15 
come in; you start awarding claims. 
You know 
16 
what I asked Ms. Feldman, so can I then tell 
17 
the victims, now just wait until whatever 
18 
resolves itself down here in the VI and you 
19 
said no. 
That defeats the whole purpose of 
20 
the program. Right? 
And we can have claims 
21 
where it could be- a multi-million dollar claim 
22 
that a person gets or you would have thirty 
23 
cases so far. 
Thirty people, all get 20 
24 
million dollars. 
Well, now the executor has 
25 
to be able to pay over this money but we have 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
197 
1 
this action going on that no, he can't. 
2 
So it has to be worked out with 
3 
something either hold back to some extent and 
4 
the Attorney General say, yes, I understand 
5 
now. 
This program has been fully presented. 
6 
The claimants attorneys are all in support of 
7 
it because it will give quick resolution for 
8 
settlement of these victims. 
They can be 
9 
compensated. 
There's a spread, depending on 
10 
what evidence they present but we need to be 
11 
able to move so much of those assets of the 
12 
Epstein estate over there to that program. And 
13 
I think it just comes to that. 
14 
So talk, I think you people need 
15 
to talk; the two sides need to speak. I 've not 
16 
allowed the Attorney General to intervene so 
17 
the AG did not hear any questions but I'm 
18 
still left where I know that I have been put 
19 
on notice that this lien is there. 
20 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Your 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
Honor? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If I may, 
we filed a supplemental brief in this matter, 
Your Honor . 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
198 
1 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: It does address 
2 
the issues Your Honor has raised. 
3 
THE COURT: Did you file a 
4 
Supplemental brief? When? 
5 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, we did. 
6 
Last Friday. 
7 
THE COURT: Last Friday? 
8 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yeah. 
9 
THE COURT: What is the date? 
10 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: The 31st. 
11 
THE COURT: Okay, then I have to 
12 
get to that. And you addressed that? 
13 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: It addresses the 
14 
issue, one about the priority of the lien, 
15 
Your Honor . 
The Attorney General, when they 
16 
filed that says that the lien takes priority, 
17 
they cut off the last sentence of the Statute 
18 
and it clearly says that the lien takes 
19 
priority and it says overall interest if the 
20 
interest is acquired subsequent to the filing 
21 
of the notice. 
22 
THE COURT: That's a beneficial 
23 
interest in it. 
24 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your Honor. 
25 
But what we've addressed is that the lien 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
199 
1 
doesn't actually have a super priority; it has 
2 
other things come before it and it's the issue 
3 
of priority. 
And we also filed in the brief 
4 
that we believe because the decedent died and 
5 
the money went to the estate, this Court took 
6 
control of the money. 
It's not some other 
7 
Court that has control of the money; they 
8 
didn't file the lien prior to the death so 
9 
therefore this Court has control of all of 
10 
decedent's money and the distribution of it. 
11 
They can file a lien and seek 
12 
for a claim in this court, but as far as 
13 
freezing the assets, we don't believe that 
14 
they can and it's addressed in our 
15 
Supplemental Brief .. 
16 
THE COURT: Okay. I may have 
17 
overlooked that. Then I will find that. 
18 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you, 
19 
Your Honor. 
20 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Just the same, 
21 
we would like an opportunity to respond, Your 
22 
Honor, cause we just got it on Friday. Sorry, 
23 
we got it yesterday at five clock by mail so 
24 
they didn't really want to have us have an 
25 
opportunity to respond. 

Probate ST-19-ea- OOBO

1 
THE COURT: Well, Okay. 
2 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: That's not 
3 
true, Your Honor. 
4 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It is true. 
5 
THE COURT: Okay. The bottom line 
6 
is, Attorney Kroblin, I've not seen it. 
7 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: I understand, 
8 
Your Honor. I just wanted to bring it to the 
9 
Court's attention. 
10 
THE COURT: I'm going to look at 
11 
it. You may have given me where I can begin 
12 
the research on this. 
13 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your Honor. 
14 
Just as far a briefing goes for us to 
15 
understand whether the Government, the lien, 
16 
cause in its papers that has been filed 
17 
although the lien seems very broad in the 
18 
papers that they've filed, they say they 
19 
didn't want to impede in any way the victims 
20 
and their being cqmpensated. 
21 
THE COURT: I did note that. 
22 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: So it seems 
23 
that the Government actually has carved out 
24 
from the lien what would be this program and 
25 
any payment to victims. 
So we would like some 

P%obate ST-19- PB- 008 0 
201 
1 
clarity on the Government's position whether 
2 
it 1 s actually seeks to impede the process of 
3 
paying victims or if the lien specifically 
4 
carves out the program of the victims. 
5 
ATTORNEY SMITH: You are free to 
6 
speak t o the Attorney General about that 
7 
issue. 
8 
THE COURT: 
Yes, we know. He l S 
9 
just a designee here. What is the extent of 
10 
the lien, correct? 
11 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes. 
12 
THE COURT: 
And I read the 
13 
extent of the lien to be everythi ng. 
14 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That is what it 
15 
provides, Your Honor. 
16 
THE COURT: But you said you had a 
17 
Supplemental Brief and I would definitely look 
18 
for that. 
19 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And, Your Honor, 
20 
we would just ask for a seven-day period to 
21 
respond to that. 
22 
THE COURT: A seven--
23 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Seven days. 
24 
THE COURT: Oh, I thought you said 
25 
seven weeks. 

Probate ST- 19- PB- 00B0 
202 
1 
ATTORNEY SMITH: No. 
Seven days 
2 
to respond to it because we just literally got 
3 
it yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock. 
4 
THE COURT: Sorry. 
You may step 
5 
down from the witness stand. 
6 
[Witness excused] 
7 
You know what? So the Court is 
8 
going to--I've now received the testimony of 
9 
the interested parties concerning this 
10 
Voluntary Claims Resolution Program. I'm going 
11 
to allow persons to file in seven days, you 
12 
have the response to the Supplemental Brief 
13 
--I do have to find that--any claimants' 
14 
attorneys who wish to file any memorandums of 
15 
law or anything what you believe can guide the 
16 
Court, again the seven days. 
17 
This Court is going to make a 
18 
quick turn around on its decision concerning 
19 
whether it can go ahead to fund this program, 
20 
yes or no on the motion that you have. 
So is 
21 
that fair enough, seven days? 
22 
ATTORNEY SMITH: To file the brief, 
23 
Your Honor, yes. 
24 
THE COURT: And anybody else, file 
25 
any response, any information, any guidance, 

?r oba t e ST-1 9- P.E- 0080 
203 
1 
any memorandum of law that you believe will 
2 
assist the Court, because I think I've dealt 
3 
with all motions before this Court. 
The only 
4 
one remaining is the creation --no, the 
5 
funding of this program through the assets of 
6 
this estate. Correct, and will be determined 
7 
then how the Court reads that lien that has 
8 
been filed by the Attorney General and in the 
9 
time where you are preparing your briefs or 
10 
your memorandum of law or whatever you believe 
11 
you need to file with the Court, I ask both 
12 
sides, Attorney Smith, Attorney Tepper, 
13 
please, Attorney Blum, Attorney Kroblin, 
14 
Attorney Whalen, and all the attorneys for the 
15 
estate, to see if we can meet cause I 
16 
understand the Attorney General's position and 
17 
her arguments, but I also understand what the 
18 
estate is trying to achieve as to the victims, 
19 
the alleged victims who are represented by 
20 
their counsels who wish this program to be put 
21 
into place so they can proceed because I 
22 
really agree, the program is going to save 
23 
time and money and especially in attorneys' 
24 
fees. 
It has to be a more effective way of 
25 
marshalling the assets than bo h sides

I 
engaging counsel going into courtsl but I have 
' 
to understand how, why I'm researching to see 
if this lien just tie up everythin~ of the 
estate. 
Maybe the parties on thei~ own could 
come to some resolution and say we l have so 
I 
I 
much money, give it to the program~ fund the 
program to a l low those victims· to ~et their 
compensation to get their relief ahd then 
l 
we'll fight whatever we have to fight in the 
' 
civil forfeiture proceeding. 
Fair\ enough? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Thank you, Your 
12 
Honor.
