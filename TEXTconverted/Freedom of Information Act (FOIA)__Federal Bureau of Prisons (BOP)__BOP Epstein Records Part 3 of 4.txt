s discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all 
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so 
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other 
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein 
received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch. 
On July 29th Epstein was removed from suicide watch by Psychology Services Department at 
MCC-New York after daily interaction with him and according to established procedures. 
Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a 
cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU 
confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks. 
On August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cell mate was taken out of the institution for a 
Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not 
return to the institution. On August 9th, Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day 
until 6:45 p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cell mate even though Epstein was on PSYCH 
Alert which included a requirement that he have a cellmate. No cellmate was assigned to his 
cell on August 9th . 
On August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction 
Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that not all of the checks 
required to be performed were actually done. 
On August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein 
unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR. When EMS arrived at the 
institution, he was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:36am.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an 
ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring 
that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I've seen additional press reports 
trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no plans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc 
Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 
hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

Good morning all. I apologize I was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Ottice called me just 
before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. I was 
speaking on the phone wit~(b)(s>: tb)(?)(C) 
I 
whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction. 
(b)rs) <b)a)cc) 
informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not 
required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement 
for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. I had recently updated t he Psychological 
Observation Procedural Memorandum which I will attach here. I have not updated the SW supplement for 
several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer. 
Als (b)(s); co)(7)(C) 
is requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for 
the sign-in sheets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. 
Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If t here are not specific post 
orders, I think we should get a copy of t he quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on 
inmate Epstein signed for the quarter.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and 
replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from 
court and was assessed the next morning.

here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for 
evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not 
warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all 
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so 
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other 
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Suicide Watch Institutional Supplement 
TEXT.htm, psychobsprocedmemo 19 .pdf 
Good morning all. I apologize I was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Office called me just 
before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. I was 
speaking on the phone witrl(b)(s>:<b)(?)(c> 
!whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction. 
b)(Bi <b)(7)<c> informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not 
required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement 
for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. I had recently updated the Psychological 
Observation Procedural Memorandum which I will attach here. I have not updated the SW supplement for 
several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer.

requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for 
the sign-ins eets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. 
Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post 
orders, I think we should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on 
inmate Epstein signed for the quarter.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse (b:(

Also, the two officers that we are putting on AL, one is scheduled off today already and the other didn't show 
(so far). So the urgency of putting them on AL is less if they are not there. Ray is checking on the schedule of 
the others.

7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no plans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc 
Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 
hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

AW Skipper-Scott, 
Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
(b)(6); (b)(?)(C) 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurs~--~saw him. 
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He 
also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed NursJbH

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is 
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another 
cell. 
Thanks,

s discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all 
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so 
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other 
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and 
replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from 
court and was assessed the next morning.

Please review for accuracy before I send t (b)(S); (b)(7Jrci 
i~llrnc, here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for 
evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not 
warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

***Inmate Message Below*** 
(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) 
I just spoke with an inmate who came out of the SHU last night. His room was directly next to 
._E_p_s-te..,..in_'_s a_.n~~l~~t~ci 
rvas anxious to describe the night of his neighbor's death. Jeffrey Epstein definitely killed 
himself. Any conspiracy theories to the contrar are ridiculous\~l~icc) 
ctually heard Jeffrey tearing up his 
sheet before committing suicide. I asked :gfJ\cc) 
if the SHU had been extraordinarily noisy and uncivilized as a 
prelude to Jeffrey killing himself. He responded in the negative - effectively refuting my theory that Epstein 
couldn't take the animals in the SHU and chose to end it as a result. I no longer believe that rooming with 
Jeffrey would have saved him. He wanted to kill himself and seized the opportunity when it was available 
(when his bunky moved out). Such is life - or death in this case. 
Friday is my home confinement date and clearly, the staff hasn't done its job although the law specifically 
states that the BOP is required to let all inmates with the appropriate risks and needs (which I am) serve 10% 
of their sentences at home. I know this isn't part of your domain. But anything you could do to get me out of 
here when the law says I should be released (two days from now) would be most appreciated.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said 
yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and 
dinner. 
Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the 
toilet from doing that again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing. 
It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I've seen additional press reports 
trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

s discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all 
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so 
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other 
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

who can. I have a private investigator we have appointed under OA coming to visit our client from out 
of town next week Monday and Tuesday. What do we need to do to get him permission to come in with 
us for a legal visit? Thank you.

ere is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation 
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He 
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

He said his cell mate is up all night talking which keeps him awake. When I offered to request a new cell mate 
for him, he stated he will try staying with his current cell mate 3 to 4 more days and will let staff know if it is 
getting too difficult.

Hi ,~mci . I'm not sure if you've already relocated but I'm hoping you can help or redirect me to someone who can. I have a 
private investigator we have appointed under CJA coming to visit our client from out of town next week Monday 
and Tuesday. What do we need to do to get him permission to come in with us for a legal visit? Thank you.

Please review for accuracy before I send to igfJlcc> 
7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation 
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He 
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said 
yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and 
dinner. 
Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the 
toilet from doing that again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been 
urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to :blc5>:(b)(7J(cJ

as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all 
b)(5) 
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so 
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other 
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
w ith him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against 
fb)(G):(b)(7)<C> 
~'ve spoken to an AFGE union official anctlcb;(5);(b)<7>(c> 
!defense 
attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today. 
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification 
of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note 
that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not 
been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide. 
(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death? 
(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide? 
(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide? 
~b)(6Y I

(4) Is it correct thar )(Gi (b)(7)(C)

the suicide?

(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a 
person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.) 
Page l:1ULU

(6) Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these 
charges? What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?

ere is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation 
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He 
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and 
replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from 
court and was assessed the next morning.

population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for 
evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not 
warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

Hi [~l~lcc) I'm not sure if you've already relocated but I'm hoping you can help or redirect me to 
someone who can. I have a private investigator we have appointed under OA coming to visit our client 
from out of town next week Monday and Tuesday. What do we need to do to get him permission to 
come in with us for a legal visit? Thank you.

AW Skipper-Scott, 
I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow 
before his Legal visit to see him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited 
bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep 
there because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said 
yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and

Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is

!~;i~l,r.i as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all 
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so 
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other 
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Also, the two officers that we are putting on AL, one is scheduled off today already and the other didn't show

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I've seen additional 
press reports trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

Epstein an-ival at MCC 
Attachments: TEXT.htm 
'b)(G>; (b)(?)cc i re is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no plans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc 
Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 
hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

Questions & Proposed Responses: 
Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against 
t b)(6);(b)(7)(C) 
1-I've spoken to an AFGE union official anj1b>(6);(b)(?)cc> 
~efense 
attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today. 
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification 
of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note 
that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not 
been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide. 
(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death? 
b)(5) 
(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide? 
(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out on a story regarding Jeffrey Epstein's death. We have 
found a series of posts that were made on the website 4chan prior to any public announcement of Epstein's 
death. The first post was made at 8:15 AM and the subsequent posts described in detail the first responders' 
actions. The first news report about Epstein's death was at roughly 9 AM. 
I've pasted one of the posts below

Can you verify the accuracy of what's been posted? Would speaking publicly about an inmate's death break 
any procedures? If so, does MCC plan to take any action on the matter or investigate it? 
Please get back to me as soon as possible today. 
Thank you,

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are 
trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any 
information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The 
USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.

wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting 
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview .

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing. 
It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I've seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing 
shortages, overtime and this incident.

and the additional language in section 11 moved from section 9. 
Cap - can you have someone address section 4 as it alleged staff wrote him a shot without having all the

7 /6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general 
population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that 
he was coming so no pkans had been established). 
7 /7 /19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for 
his personal safety in general population. 
7 /8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation 
by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He 
was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7 /10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7 /23.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and 
replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from 
court and was assessed the next morning.

AW Skipper-Scott, 
I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow 
before his Legal visit to see him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited 
bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep 
there because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

AW Skipper-Scott, 
I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow 
before his Legal visit to see him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited 
bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep 
there because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are 
trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any 
information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The 
USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.

Thank you for your letter of AuSU5t 10, 2019 regarding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. 
Epstein's death i5 a ttagedy to everyone involved in his case. 
One open question, among others, is whether the investigntions referenced in your 1.etter 
wilJ include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019. To my 
knowledge, it has never been defi.nitivdy explajned what the BOP concluded abou.t that incident

A couple of issues came out of the Epstein Reconstruction which I wanted to problem solve when you have 
an opportunity to meet: 
(b)(5) 
Other issues regarding the SW program: 
1. We need to ensure the Unit 2 Officer is making rounds each hour and signing the log book. While the 
officer is back there, if an inmate companion needs to utilize the bathroom he should be allowed to do so. 
Inmate Companions have been urinating in the garbage cans out of desperation. 
2. Inmates on suicide watch need to be fed as timely as possible. 
3. Inmates on suicide watch need to receive showers on M, W, and F. 
4. Suicide Watch mattresses are being taken from our area to be used in GP. They are specialized and 
expensive mattresses. 
5. If my orderly brings dirty smocks to the elevator, can internal bring them to the laundry in the basement? 
Dirty Smocks are getting misplaced or thrown away. 
6. Lt's need to strip out t he inmate going on suicide watch and thoroughly search the inmate companions 
coming down for contraband and inappropriate items. If the inmate companions bring down contraband 
for the inmates on Suicide Watch, they will be terminated. 
7. Lt.' need to search the suicide watch room before inmates go into the room on suicide watch. 
8. Lt's need to ensure inmates on suicide watch are placed in a smock without clothing, glasses, etc. unless 
otherwise indicated by a psychologist and with on the front of the log book.

I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be 
delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference? 
Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every 
hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate? 
Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other 
inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch 
which is sent up from food service every morning. 
Please provide a response. 
Thank You,

Also, the two officers that we are putting on AL, one is scheduled off today already and the other didn't show 
(so far). So the urgency of putting them on AL is less if they are not there. Ray is checking on the schedule of

I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be 
delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference? 
Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every 
hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate? 
Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other 
inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch 
which is sent up from food service every morning. 
Please provide a response. 
Thank You,

Update: We got over 30 inquiries. My boss is drafting a very short answer that will probably say we don't 
comment on an inmate's health status or conditions of confinement for privacy reasons. 
My boss had me call MCC NY just now to be sure they are not releasing varying statements to the media, we 
want the institution & me to use the same exact statement to all media (we'll give them the statement we 
come up with shortly and be sure they're fine with it) and they just told me you're acting will call me back 
shortly. 
Last thing - I didn't realize he went to the hospital, I might ask your acting exec. if he's still at the hospital or 
how long there, etc., if that's true (news article say he went to a hospital).

oo mornin 
I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych 
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of 
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's 
subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death 
in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, I will have the USAO's Civil Division 
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 
(1951) and the associated regulations. 
Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. 
Thank you,

Hugh, 
1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide 
Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA. 
2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding 
more information. 
(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOP's 
response to the union's contention is staffing shortages is at the root of the problem? 
'b)(S) 
3. The second attachment is a collection of data Psychology Services does every year. 2018 and 2017 will 
likely have one more death added to each year. This were discovered this week, one at CAA and one at an 
RRC that PSB was never notified about. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The 
BOP has an extensive Suicide Prevention Program that begins upon an inmate's arrival at each BOP 
facility, including pretrial facilities such as MCC New York. See BOP Program Statement 5324.08 "Suicide 
Prevention Program" here https://www.bop.gov/po)icy/progstat/5324 008,pdf and BOP Program 
Statement 5310.17 "Psychology Services Manual" here 
https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5310_017.pdf. During the initial intake screening by medical 
staff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately 
notified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place 
an inmate on suicide watch. 
The Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program 
Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance 
with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral, 
assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly 
restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for 
housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's 
Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without 
compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to 
the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects, 
materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are 
evaluated daily by a psychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions. 
Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist 
following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate. 
With regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654 
correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and 
retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. The 
BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess 
any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed. 
The factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors 
include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a 
plan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.

Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. The 
BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess 
any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed. 
The factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors 
include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a 
plan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.

Good morning,

In wake of the Epstein death, I understand that institutions across the bureau are designating specific 
officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations where 
inmates are at some risk for suicide. 
Is there someone who may be able to elaborate on this effort?

As discussed, we would like to see the 2nd floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9th floor 
SHU, and Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would 
appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given 
the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and 
where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor bridge.

The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The 
BOP has an extensive Suicide Prevention Program that begins upon an inmate's arrival at each BOP 
facility, including pretrial facilities such as MCC New York. See BOP Program Statement 5324.08 "Suicide 
Prevention Program" here https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5324 008.pdf and BOP Program 
Statement 5310.17 "Psychology Services Manual" here 
https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5310 017.pdf. During the initial intake screening by medical 
staff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately 
notified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place 
an inmate on suicide watch. 
The Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program 
Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance 
with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral, 
assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly 
restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for 
housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's 
Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without 
compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to 
the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects, 
materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are 
evaluated daily by a psychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions. 
Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist 
following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate. 
With regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654 
correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and 
retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. The

µuusatoday.com> 10/22/2019 10:32 AM > > 
In wake of the Epstein death, I understand that institutions across the bureau are designating specific 
officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations where 
inmates are at some risk for suicide. 
Is there someone who may be able to elaborate on this effort? 
Many thanks,

Hugh, 
Wanted to give you the heads up, there is an Inmate Suicide Prevention Pro ram Memo in your mailbox that 
you will probably want to review tomorrow. I discussed it with 'b)(
6
> (b)(7)(c ) 
today. 
Basically following inmate Epstein's suicide, Wardens are defaulting to leaving inmates on suicide watch 
longer than the institutional Psychologists would advise. So the memo to the RDs seeks to remind Wardens 
to utilize the professional psychological expertise of the institutional psychologists in managing 
inmate suicide through the variety of healing strategies. ~\~lee) is in the office tomorrow, 10/ 18, if you want 
to discuss with her the best way to communicate this to the RD and Wardens and if you have any questions. 
Have a great day. Peace co)r5) (b)(7)(C)

He stated he hasn't slept well at MCC-NY because he hasn't had his cpap machine. He stated it is here and he will be 
able to start using it tonight. He discussed how he does not think he will able to sleep in SHU and how he does not like 
SHU because of the noise. He discussed issues on not getting some medication with Medical today. 
The "Eating/Shower Chart" indicated yesterday he ate breakfast and dinner, drank liquids, and took a shower when 
offered and so far today it noted he ate breakfast and drank liquids. The Psych Observation Log noted he slept, drank 
water, went to legal, and talked to an Inmate Companion about investments.

no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were 
denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no

of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. l(b)(7)(Al

Focus of Session 
He was seen by writer while he was on Psych Observation. 
Subjective/Objective Presentation 
The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12 
hours per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the "Eating/Shower Chart" may not reflect 
all of his meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water 
at night. The Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept. 
Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse .b)l5l;(b)(?)(c from Medical had seen him for 
this. 
When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist 
with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nursefb)<51;(b>c7xc> I 
He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and 
upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was 
not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got 
with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism 
spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also 
really good with numbers. 
Current Mental Status: He exhibited a mildly anxious mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and 
coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual 
hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. 
He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff and Inmate Companions if he 
starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to 
self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff and Inmate Companions if he has these thoughts. 
lntervention(s) 
Supportive and educative interventions were again provided. He had not been given the Turning Point handouts 
yesterday that were on his cell door, so they were handed to him by staff today. 
Progress/Plan 
He will remain on Psych Observation in an abundance of caution and pending housing arrangements to be made on 
Monday. While on Psych Observation, he will be seen daily by Psychology.

my position. 
Inmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it "a 
punishment cell." He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong. Inmate Epstein 
stated he feels it is dangerous in the SHU, he cannot sleep well up there due to noise from the other inmates, it smells, 
and it is difficult for him to work on his legal case up there. He stated he has not received the phone calls he was 
promised nor has he been able to receive recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the

phone calls and recreation. Inmate Epstein also reported complaints about the attorney conference room, stating they 
do not take him to the bathroom frequently enough. 
Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating "I am too vested in my case to fight it, I have a life 
and I want to go back to living my life." He denied any acute symptoms at this time. 
According to his log book, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has 
also been attending his daily legal visits.

and drinking within normal limits.

Reason for Removal from Watch 
Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "I have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his 
being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include 
interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not 
do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than 
in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be 
re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU 
and asked if there were a "safer" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr. 
EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on 
Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for 
one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this 
information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.

Inmate Epstein was seen today for a psychological observation contact in the hospital area by this writer. 
Subjective/Objective Presentation 
Inmate Epstein appeared well and it was noted in his log book and eating/sleeping chart that he has been eating his 
meals, sleeping, interacting with the inmate companions, and pacing in his cell. Today, he presented this writer with 
numerous concerns and requests. He stated he does not want to be housed in the SHU because he is not comfortable 
there; he wants to be single-celled if he goes to the SHU; he wants Colace, not the Ducolex he received from medical 
yesterday; he wants to be able to walk around and go to recreation; he does not want to wear an orange uniform to his 
legal visits because he is treated "like a punished inmate;" he wants a phone call before he leaves the psychological 
observation area; he wants a shower and towel; he would like to be housed in the cadre (5S) unit; and would like his 
property, paper, and a pen. 
Inmate Epstein's concerns were addressed by this writer and it was explained to him he will not be single-celled or 
placed in a housing unit for safety and security concerns. His medical concerns (constipation) were discussed with

which is double the drop in the prison pop. This is highly misleading. As you know (and AG Sessions and 
DAG Rosenstein were also acutely aware of), over the 5 years leading into this administration our prison 
population had dropped 40,000 inmates, but our staffing had gone up (and pop has continued to drop 
another almost 9,000 since the start of the Administration)! The drop in staffing that they are referring to 
also likely includes the 5156 unfunded vacant positions that were eliminated ... positions we never could fill in 
the first place.

that will listen (and have reiterated this in several Hill briefings), the problem is not our authorized staffing 
levels or funding, rather it is finding good candidates to come work for us in hard to fill areas. I have dozens 
of examples where we post jobs, get 30 applicants and only 10 end up actually coming on board. At that 
rate it will take a long time just to fill the vacancies we have. We are working on several new initiatives to try 
and make BOP more attractive to applicants (unfortunately news like this does not help).

Ok, this is going to be sensitive. Cant say I'm surprised people want to be cautious. I will want to hear about 
specific examples of significant problems. Why sending to RDs and not to all CEOs? All CEO memo will need 
Exec staff and union clearance first, but it will ensure the message gets out. We can discuss tomorrow.

Hugh, 
Wanted to give you the heads up, there is an Inmate Suicide Prevention Program Memo in your mailbox t hat 
you will probably want to review tomorrow. I discussed it wit~(b)cs>:<b)(7)(c> 
f oday. 
Basically following inmate Epstein's suicide, Wardens are defaulting to leaving inmates on suicide watch 
longer than the institutional Psychologists would advise. So the memo to the RDs seeks to remind Wardens 
to utilize the professional psychological expertise of the institutional psychologists in managing 
inmate suicide through the variety of healing strategies. ~!~~r., 
is in the office tomorrow, 10/18, if you want 
to discuss with her the best way to communicate this to the RD and Wardens and if you have any questions.

As discussed, we would like to see the 2nd floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9th floor 
SHU, and Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would 
appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given 
the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and 
where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor bridge.
