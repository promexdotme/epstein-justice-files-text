(Case called) 
THE COURT:  Good morning, everybody.  Please be
seated.
So just some housekeeping.  We have a podium here for
both attorneys and others who may be speaking, and so we would
like you, attorneys and others who are speaking, to come up to
the podium.  This room is a little cavernous.  We thought the
podium over there would be more comfortable.
For starters, and for this you don't have to go up to
the podium, if you could just indicate your names.  This table
in front to my left, your right, are defense counsel, and that
table to my right, your left, are government attorneys.
If we could just ask the attorneys to introduce 
themselves. 
MS. COMEY:  Good morning, your Honor.  Maureen Comey
and Alison Moe for the government.  Joining us at counsel table
are Special Agent Amanda Young of the FBI and Detective Paul
Byrne of the NYPD.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Good morning, your Honor.  
Reid Weingarten.

THE COURT:  Great.
Again, good morning to all of you.  This hearing that 
we're having today considers the government's motion to dismiss 
the indictment in this case.   
I must add that it also serves as the opportunity for 
me to thank all of you, the attorneys and the victims who are 
here today, among others, for your very hard work and 
dedication in this case. 
We also have here today the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, who has also
been very helpful and indispensable in this matter.
The news on August 10, 2019, that Jeffrey Epstein had
been found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center, at the MCC, was certainly shocking.  Most of you, and
myself for that matter, were anticipating that the next steps
in this case would be defense motion practice, including a
motion to dismiss, followed by a trial on the merits before a
jury, if the motions were not successful, and through which the
accusers and the accused would come face to face, allowing
everyone to get their day in court.  Mr. Epstein's death
obviously means that a trial in which he is a defendant cannot
take place.  It is a rather stunning turn of events.
The government's motion to dismiss the indictment
because of Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, is

relatively straightforward.  In my view, a public hearing
clearly is nevertheless the preferred vehicle for its
resolution.
Incidentally, while I'm on this subject, I got some
help today from the New York Law Journal from two professors
who write that a hearing is -- let me tell you exactly what
they said.  They say, in part, that this is an odd moment for
transparency in a criminal case.  I think that is an odd
sentence to hear about, transparency in a criminal case.
They go on to say that normally, if a prosecutor seeks 
to dismiss an indictment for such an obviously worthy reason, 
the court would simply grant the request.  As to that 
statement, I respectfully say it is incorrect as a matter of 
law. 
They go on to say the judge would not schedule a
hearing and he definitely would not allow the victims to speak.
If he did hold a hearing, whatever informational interests the
victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to
attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking role.
I read it.  It was incredulous.  I'm still
incredulous.  I don't quite understand at all.  There is a
suggestion in the article that the reason they are making these
suggestions has to do with minimization of drama in this case.
In the Jeffrey Epstein case, there has not been much a
minimization of drama, and what little drama might happen

today, I don't think it would be very significant.
On a somewhat more serious note, don't quote me on
this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of
that article is himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related
cases.  I was surprised to learn that very recently.  I'm
certain it is true.  I was also surprised that that aspect was
not disclosed in the Law Journal.
But in any event, I think you know where I'm heading.
I respectfully disagree with the Law Journal piece.  I was
saying that the government's motion is relatively
straightforward, and in my view, a public hearing is clearly,
nevertheless, the preferred vehicle for its resolution.  I'm
still convinced of that.
A few may differ on this, but public hearings are
exactly what judges do.  Hearings promote transparency and they
provide the court with insights and information which the court
may not otherwise be aware of.
The victims have been included in the proceeding today
both because of their relevant experiences and because they
should always be involved before rather than after the fact.
Indictment 19 CR 490 charges Jeffrey Epstein with sex 
trafficking and with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.  The 
U.S. Attorney, on August 19, 2019, requested that the court 
approve the government's proposed order of nolle prosequi.  I 
think that's a rough justice.  That means nolle prosequi,

discontinuance by the prosecutor of all or of a part of the 
case that he or she has commenced. 
The government in its motion concludes that Epstein's
death abates these proceedings.  In accordance with Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b), I determined to hold a public
hearing and I notified the victims that they would be given the
opportunity to be heard before any final action on the motion.
That is the purpose also of today's proceeding.  I would do
that every time.
Also, recognized that Epstein, Mr. Epstein died before
any judgment of conviction against him had been obtained, and
that the government's proposed order appears, in form and
substance, to be appropriate.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a) codifies the
nolle prosequi process.  It is entitled dismissal, and it
states in relevant part that the government may, with leave of
the court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint,
and that leave of the court proviso, you should know, was added
as an amendment to the original draft of Rule 48, which had
originally provided for automatic dismissal upon the motion of
the government.
This proviso, in my judgment, is clearly directed 
toward an independent judicial assessment of the public 
interest in dismissing the indictment.  Thus, even whereas, in 
this case, the standard of court review is deferential, the

court must still make its own independent determination.  A 
conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is 
appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations. 
It is also, in my view, required that the court
consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing
and before deciding whether to grant the motion.  This is being
done here both as a matter of law and as a measure of respect
that we have for the victims' difficult decisions to come
forward in this matter.
In a case called United States v. Heaton,
H-e-a-t-o-n-, the government filed a Rule 48 motion for leave
to dismiss a charge against a defendant who allegedly committed
a sexual offense against a young victim.  Although I should
point out, very importantly, that that defendant was still
alive, which distinguishes it from our case.  
Nevertheless, I think it is irrelevant because in 
evaluating the Rule 48 motion, then district Judge Paul G. 
Cassell -- who is now a law professor at the University of Utah 
and is regarded to be a noted expert in victims' rights -- 
concluded that under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, victims 
have broad rights that extend to a court's decision whether to 
grant a government motion to dismiss under Rule 48. 
I completely share that viewpoint in these
circumstances, even though the facts of our case, as I said,
are somewhat different from those in Heaton.  I believe it is

the court's responsibility, and manifestly within its purview,
to ensure that the victims in this case are treated fairly and
with dignity.
The fundamental substantive principle which applies in
considering the government's motion is termed the rule of
abatement.  This principle originated in the English common
law.  It was adopted by most U.S. federal courts, but more
recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism.  The rule of
abatement is best explained in the Second Circuit case of
U.S. v. Wright.
In that Wright case, two defendants had pled guilty to 
embezzlement and tax evasion.  Both defendants appealed, but 
one of the defendants died while his appeal was pending in the 
Second Circuit.  The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule 
of abatement, the judgment of conviction against the deceased 
defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to 
be dismissed.  The Wright court held that when a convicted 
defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending, 
his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had 
during the course of the prosecution. 
The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that
when a criminal conviction abates upon the death of a
defendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that
conviction must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with
respect to associated forfeiture orders.

This latter application of the rule of abatement
regarding forfeiture has not been universally accepted among
federal courts, but it certainly is the law in this circuit.
Some of you may be interested to know that some United States
courts, state courts, have criticized the rule of abatement,
particularly in the face of growing recognition of victims'
rights in the criminal justice system, including the Crime
Victims' Rights Act.
It has been written and contended in the Brooklyn Law
Review -- I can give you the cite later -- that when courts
abate criminal convictions, they reimpose a burden on victims
that legislatures intended to alleviate through these victim
rights statutes.  The state Supreme Court has even concluded
that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides
the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of
abatement.  It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and
its constitution now require the criminal justice system to
accommodate the rights of crime victims.  Further, that the
abatement of criminal convictions has important implications
for these rights.
But coming back to our case, which is what you are
concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude
that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant
as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the
Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when

Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction.
So that's just some background I wanted to share with
you.  At this point in time, I would like to turn to the
government prosecutors to hear from them in support of their
Rule 48 application to dismiss the Epstein indictment.
MS. COMEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
Would you like me to address the court from the 
podium? 
THE COURT:  If you wouldn't mind.
MS. COMEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
I believe your Honor has accurately summarized the
state of the law, as set forth in our papers, in light of the
clear Second Circuit law, that upon the death of a defendant
before a final entry of a judgment of conviction, all
proceedings must be abated.
In light of that clear law, the government is legally 
obligated to seek dismissal of the pending indictment against 
Jeffrey Epstein, and we respectfully submit, likewise, that the 
entry of the proposed order is similarly required by law. 
A few notes to make about that, though, your Honor.
To be very clear, dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey
Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's
ongoing investigation into other potential coconspirators, nor
does it prevent the bringing of a new case in the future or the
prosecution of new defendants.

It also does nothing to prevent the government from
continuing to explore the possibility of seeking civil
forfeiture of any assets that were used to facilitate the
crimes charged in this indictment.  Indeed, as has been stated
publicly, investigations into those matters have been ongoing,
remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the
indictment here.
I would also like to note that, as the government has
previously mentioned, this dismissal in no way lessens the
government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case,
both those who have come forward and those who have yet to do
so.  We agree with your Honor's sentiment that those victims
should be respected, and we appreciate your Honor's recognition
of that.
One housekeeping matter that I did want to reference
for your Honor.  The protective order in this case requires
destruction or return of any and all discovery material upon
conclusion of the case.  We have been in communication with
defense counsel, who have confirmed that they have returned all
physical copies that they have of discovery that the government
has produced to date, and they are in the process of deleting
any copies that they may have made.  So the parties are in
compliance with the protective order.
Finally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims
in this case, and particularly those who are here in court

today.  I'll note that in light of the court's order indicating
that the victims and their counsel would be permitted to be
heard in court here today, the government has endeavored to
provide notice to all known victims of today's proceeding.  We
did so either directly where a victim was not represented by
counsel or through counsel where a victim is represented by an
attorney.
The government does not know exactly how many victims
or their attorneys are here today and we do not know how many
of them or their counsel would like to speak.  To the extent
any individuals do wish to speak, we do not know the substance
of what they would like to say.  We have left that entirely up
to the individual decisions of the victims and their attorneys.
I will note, though, that throughout this case, the
government has endeavored and done our utmost to fulfill our
obligations under the Crimes Victims' Rights Act.  We have done
so by trying to keep as many victims as we are aware of up to
date about the ongoing case and about any developments in the
case.
We will continue to provide services and offer 
services to any of the victims in this case, even after the 
indictment is dismissed.  Both the U.S. Attorney's office and 
the FBI have been in touch with all known victims or have 
attempted to be in touch with all known victims, either again 
directly where victims are not represented by counsel or

Unless the court has any questions for me, the

THE COURT:  I just have one question.

need to do something? 
MS. COMEY:  It is self-executing, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thanks very much, Ms. Comey.

Mr. Weingarten, I'm happy to hear from you.

Your Honor, I think it is an understatement of the

did the last time I was before you.  For us, the elephant in
the room is what happened to our client.  I would like to tell
you how we see the world and where we are on that subject.
We start with the Attorney General's statements,
public statements, that there were very serious improprieties
in the jail.  We obviously read the press.  We see that the
warden has been taken out.  We see that the guards on duty at
the time have been put on leave.  We understand guards are

refusing to cooperate with the investigation.  We have heard
allegations that people at the time who had responsibility for
protecting our client falsified information.  We understand
that there were orders out there that Jeffrey Epstein was never
to be left alone and that the orders were ignored by many of
the employees of the prison.
In a word, yikes.  In addition, obviously we followed
the medical examiner's report, or we haven't followed the
report, we haven't seen it, but heard conclusions, initially
not enough evidence to come to a conclusion, wanted to see
more.  We assumed she was talking about the videotapes, but
then came to the conclusion that it was suicide.
We report to the court that -- 
THE COURT:  Suicide by hanging --

MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.  
And we report to the court that we had a doctor there 
at the time, and we also have been in receipt of a tremendous 
amount of medical and scientific evidence volunteered to us 
opining that the injuries suffered, as reported, were far more 
consistent with assault than with suicide, and we are happy to 
supply the court with all the information that we have. 
Now, in addition, as the court noted, we were underway
with our pretrial motions, and as the court obviously

understands, the NPA and the role of the NPA was going to be
critically important.  And I would simply like to report that
we went pretty far along.
We interviewed all of the relevant lawyers on the 
defense side who participated in the NPA, and we were satisfied 
that we had a very strong argument that every one of those 
lawyers believed with an objective basis that the deal was 
global.  That is, at the time -- 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, that?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  The deal of the NPA was global.  That
is, more specifically, at the time, the Florida prosecutors and
agents knew of conduct in New York, and that no competent
defense counsel negotiating in good faith with the prosecutors
would have ever agreed to a deal back then that allowed New
York prosecutors to indict for precisely the same conduct in
the future, which, of course, is what happened.
In addition, we have come up with very powerful
evidence, we believe, that Florida prosecutors, who
participated in the deal, steered the victims and the alleged
victims to New York on more than one occasion because they did
not want to suffer the sleights of attacks against them.  So we
have advanced the ball on this very subject and we are prepared
to completely report to the court as to where we are and what
we've done.
Another point.  We obviously had contact with our

client at or around the time of his death, and obviously the
attorney-client privilege survives death and we are not going
to forfeit the privilege, but we will report to the court, with
as much specificity as the court may want, that at or around
the time of his death, we did not see a despairing, despondent
suicidal person.  Details to follow, if the court wishes.
The 800-pound gorilla, for us, of course, are the
video surveillance tapes.  Obviously we assume there is a tape
that leads directly to the door where Jeffrey Epstein was
housed.  If that tape reports for 12 hours before his death
that no one went in and out of that room, then the suggestion
that there was something other than a suicide seems
preposterous.
But there is no such evidence that has surfaced to 
date.  Just the opposite.  We have heard, and we actually read 
in the press, that the tapes were either corrupted or not 
functioning.  Talk about a yikes.  If, in fact, the system was 
broken for six months before Jeffrey Epstein was housed, I 
mean, that would be stunning incompetence.  If it was allowed 
to continue to be inoperative when Jeffrey Epstein was housed, 
it would be incompetence times ten.  But what if the tapes only 
broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he 
was killed or the day he died?  Then we're in a completely 
different situation. 
So where does this lead?  I think where it leads,

Judge, is there are incredibly important questions that remain
open.  The public interest in this matter is obvious from this
courtroom.  There are conspiracy theories galore.  We are all
for finding the truth.  We believe this court has an
indispensable role to play.
Whether or not this indictment is dismissed, I think
this court has the inherent authority to find out what happened
on its watch.  Obviously, when the court detained Jeffrey
Epstein, the court did not anticipate that weeks later he would
be dead in his cell.  I think given the inherent authority of
the court, the court should make inquiry.
This could come in many forms.  Obviously the court 
made inquiry as to what happened in the first incident.  When 
there was an allegation of an attempted suicide, the court made 
inquiry.  The court obviously was interested. 
I recall your language.  You talked about that being
one of the several open questions indicating an interest on the
court for the others as well.  Obviously, the ultimate question
is what happened to the client.
THE COURT:  You're talking about the July 23, 2019
incident?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
The court obviously could hold hearings.  The court
could assign a lawyer to help the court.  I think this is an
area where there is intense public interest.  We have complete

confidence in the prosecutors in the Southern District and the
FBI to do a competent investigation.  But these are allegations
against serious components of the United States Department of
Justice.  Sometimes the appearance of justice is just as
important as justice itself.
I think the court supervising, or at least keeping an
interest in this proceeding, is incredibly important for the
public to have confidence in the ultimate findings, and
certainly for us to have confidence in the ultimate findings.
One more issue, Judge.  The conditions of the jail, in
a word, they were dreadful.  Not just for Jeffrey Epstein, but
for many of the prisoners over there.  This is a prison within
the shadows of this courthouse.  The situation is rife with
vermin.  The abuse and the conditions in that prison, in a
word, are a disgrace and everybody knows it.
A person with authority told us, someone with 
knowledge, that the prisoners in Guantanamo -- and he spoke 
with personal knowledge -- are treated better than the 
prisoners right across the way.  The feds certainly know how to 
run a disciplined, clean prison.  I've been in 20 of them.  
They know how to do it just fine.  And the question is, why in 
the world does it not happen down the road?  I think that is a 
perfectly legitimate subject for the court to make inquiry.   
In a word, we want the court to help us find out what 
happened.  The court has a role to play.  It is the institution

that most people have confidence in in these very troubled 
times.   
So whether or not you dismiss the indictment, to us, 
is beside the point.  We want you to stay on the case, we want 
you to conduct an investigation, and we want to know what 
happened here. 
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Just so it is clear, so your view on the
motion directly on its merits of the nolle prosequi order and
application by the U.S. Attorney, do you have a view on that?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  I think if the court felt that the
case had to stay alive for the court to continue, we would
oppose it.  I think --
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, if what?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  If the issue, if you took the
position for you to conduct the investigation or lead the
investigation or participate in the investigation, then we
want, the role we want you to play, if the indictment has to be
alive, we would oppose the motion.
I don't think you need to do that.  I think you can
dismiss the indictment.
THE COURT:  So you're suggesting that you support the
government's motion, just viewed in the context of --
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, of course.

MR. WEINBERG:  Judge, if I can just supplement?
THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thank you, sir.
Thank you, as an out-of-town lawyer for the privilege
to appear in front of you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  It's my pleasure.
MR. WEINBERG:  First, as to the conditions, we think
your Honor trusted the government, the Bureau of Prisons, to
keep our client safe and keep him in civilized conditions.  The
government will again ask, as to other defendants, that they be
detained at the MCC, some subset of them will end up in the SHU
unit.
It is a horrific.  I've called it medieval.  There's
vermin on the floor.  There is wet from the plumbing.  There is
no sunlight.  There is limited exercise.  It is simply
conditions that no pretrial detainee -- and I would go farther
as a criminal defense lawyer -- no United States defendant
should be subjected to.
Certain judges have taken views of the conditions.  We 
would urge your Honor, the government talks about and we talk 
about transparency, to see what kind of conditions there exist 
within 50 or 100 yards of one of the great United States 
district courts. 
Second, in terms, we have a profound problem with the
conclusions of the medical examiner.  There are for three

J8RsEPS1                           
reasons, your Honor.
One is the timing of Mr. Epstein's demise.  It was on
August 10.  On August 12, a bail pending appeal motion was
being filed in the Second Circuit.  On August 12 or 13, the
United States Attorneys were going to respond to our request
for the preservation and production of documents that would
have facilitated and furthered our efforts to demonstrate
communications between the Southern District of Florida, the
Northern District of Georgia, which was standing in the shoes
of the Southern District of Florida main justice and the
Southern District.
In other words, we were beginning the process 
discharging our responsibilities.  There had been no new 
evidence that Mr. Epstein had committed any offense against a 
minor after 2005.  The subject matter of the New York 
prosecution was squarely within the heartland of the Florida 
NPA.  We had a significant motion to dismiss.  This was not a 
futile, you know, defeatist attitude. 
Third, we had all the discovery motions that your
Honor had scheduled.  So the timing for a pretrial detainee to
commit suicide on August 10, when his bail pending appeal
motion is being filed on August 12, strikes us as implausible.
Second, we had an independent doctor who was present
at the autopsy which occurred on August 11.  On August 11, the
city medical examiner's findings were inconclusive.  We are

told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken
bones in Mr. Epstein's neck, in his larynx, are more consistent
with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide, if
you will, than with suicide.  It doesn't exclude suicide, but
the pure medical forensic evidence creates profound issues
about what happened to him.
Also the time of death.  Our medical examiner's
opinion is it occurred at least 45 minutes and probably hours
before 6:30 a.m. on August 10, when he was first found, if you
will, according to the reports.  Yet he was moved, something
that is not ordinary in these circumstances.
I would also --
THE COURT:  Excuse me.  He was moved?
MR. WEINBERG:  Instead of having the cell in the
condition it was found, if he had been dead for 45 minutes or
two hours or four hours, there were efforts to move him and,
therefore, make it more difficult to reconstruct whether or not
he died of suicide or some other cause.
I spoke to Stacey Richmond, who is a responsible
member of this court who represents the family of Mr. Epstein.
She spoke to the medical examiner on the Friday after
Mr. Epstein's death and asked why, if the conclusion was made
late in the afternoon on Friday that week.  She specifically
asked about what extrinsic nonmedical evidence caused the
medical examiner to go from uncertain to suicide, and she was

told that the medical examiner had seen nine minutes of one
video which was on a stairwell between floors at the MCC.  She
was told that the principal video that would have showed the
whole hall was corrupted.  It was in DC with the FBI to see if
they can reconstruct it.  
And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did, 
you know, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in 
the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado known 
to the MCC before August 10, or was this corruption occurring 
on August 10, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the 
servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was 
suicide rather than some other cause. 
So with my co-counsel, we ask your Honor, it is not a
question of trust or not trust.  They ask you to detain people
and you trust the Bureau of Prisons.  And it is within your
inherit authority, your Honor, to find out what happened to our
client.
We are angry about the conditions he was held in.  And 
we're also angry, quite frankly, your Honor, that the only 
source of information that we get as to what happened to him is 
through the media rather than through the United States 
Attorney's office.  We've made requests informal.  We have 
made Touhy requests.  We've been told there is a pending 
investigation.   
But we trust your Honor and the judiciary, and with

all due respect, we believe there is an inherent and central 
role, a pivotal role in your Honor to find out what happened to 
a defendant in a case before the court, whether or not the 
court grants the nolle pros today or whether it holds it 
pending an investigation into Mr. Epstein's death. 
We're not here without significant doubts regarding
the conclusion of suicide.  We are not here to say what
happened.  We don't know what happened.  But we deeply want to
know what happened to our client.

Just briefly.  With the exception of the noting that

THE COURT:  Well, it may be.  Well, I don't know.  You
say irrelevant.
It is a public hearing, and I think it is fair game 
for defense counsel to raise its concerns. 
MS. COMEY:  Certainly, your Honor.  But it is
irrelevant to whether or not the motion should be granted.
THE COURT:  Right.  I get that.
MS. COMEY:  I would also note that the question of
Mr. Epstein's death is the subject of an ongoing and active
investigation, as has been publicly noted, by a separate team
of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District
of New York, separate from the team who is handling this
prosecution, as well as a separate team of FBI agents.
There is an ongoing and active grand jury 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's 
death.  It is the function of a grand jury and of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation to investigate crimes in the federal 
court system.  It is not the purview, respectfully, of the 
court to conduct an investigation into uncharged matters. 
So respectfully, we disagree with defense counsel's
suggestion that the court has some authority to conduct an
independent investigation.  To the extent any other defendants
who are detained in the MCC have concerns about the conditions
or believe that the conditions are relevant to a future or
current bail determination, it is for those defendants and

their counsel to raise those arguments and for the judges
hearing those arguments to evaluate those claims.  It is not
relevant to today's proceedings.
Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  In those other cases, Ms. Comey, judges do
have authority to investigate, but don't here?
MS. COMEY:  Not to investigate, your Honor, but to
hear arguments about the conditions of confinement in the MCC
as they may relate to any bail determination.  I believe that
was the argument that was made.
The bigger picture here, your Honor, is that the focus
of today's proceeding, as we understand it, is to allow the
victims who have gathered here today to be heard and to comment
upon the case and to comment upon the motion that is pending,
and to bring this case to a close.
THE COURT:  Got it.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  May I?

he was deeply troubled by the alleged Brady violations.  I
represented the prosecutors in that case, so I'm very, very
familiar with it.
It is analogous.  It is a situation where there was
tremendous controversy over what happened in the case and
whether or not the prosecutors went off the reservation.  Judge
Sullivan -- and there were three or four independent -- not
independent, DOJ inquiries into the very same matter.  But
Judge Sullivan wanted his own opportunity to make a judgment
with his own independent investigation.
THE COURT:  OK.
MR. WEINBERG:  If I could just add one precedent, your
Honor.  
The Chief judge in the District of Massachusetts or 
the Chief Judge at the time, Judge Wolf, in a case called 
U.S. v. Fleming, when the conditions at Walpole, which is a 
state prison where federal prisoners were being held -- we 
don't have a federal MCC in Boston -- went to the prison, 
stayed in the prison to determine whether or not the complaints 
about the conditions were authentic.   
I think your Honor has the inherent authority to go to 
the ninth floor and see how the MCC houses pretrial detainees.   
Thank you.

motion is granted that is pending before us?

remain before the district court.  Jurisdiction is not
completely divested.  Your Honor issued a pretrial detention
order and your Honor has the power, the inherent authority,
they are not going to refuse to allow you to go look at the
ninth floor.  They are going to count on you to make decisions
in the future.
I just trust that the executive branch is not going to 
prevent the judicial branch from looking into the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein or the conditions in the SHU unit at the MCC, 
sir. 
THE COURT:  Great.  Thank you.
MS. COMEY:  May I, your Honor?
Just very briefly, your Honor.  I would note that upon
the dismissal of the indictment, which I believe the parties
agree is appropriate in this case, there would be no case.
There would be no jurisdiction for the court to conduct any
sort of inquiry, even if the court had such authority.
THE COURT:  Right.
OK.  I think we've heard enough.
It is at this point in the hearing that I would like
to call upon victims' counsel, plural, for any remarks they may
have and they may wish to make.  Also, to introduce their
clients, those of them who wish to be heard.

It would be helpful if, in doing that, if counsel --
Mr. Edwards and I see and I see Mr. Boise as well -- I know
they are counsel to several, at least several of the victims.
It would be helpful if whoever is speaking, both Mr. Edwards
and Mr. Boise, would indicate to the court whether or not they
have discussed the pending motion with their clients, that is
to say and the rule of abatement, etc., etc. with them prior to
today's hearing.
Are we going to hear from Mr. Edwards first, is that
right?
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  You bet.
It would be helpful, Mr. Edwards, if you would state
and spell your name for the court reporter.
If you are going to introduce someone else, which I 
trust that you are, if you could state and spell their name as 
well. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes, your Honor.
May it please the court.  Brad Edwards, B-r-a-d 
E-d-w-a-r-d-s, with the law firm of Edwards Pottinger. 
I have in the courtroom today 15 victims that I
represent and have represented over the years.  There are at
least 20 more who didn't make this hearing today for a
multitude of reasons, some out of fear of public exposure,
others because the way in which this case ended will never

bring full justice, and they decided it was best for them not
to talk today.
Some of my clients are going to address the court that
are here today.  Others are not.  Some are going to use their
names, and have in the past, and others wish to remain
anonymous.  And I have instructed each of them to inform the
court reporter that they will be proceeding as Jane Doe so that
the court reporter can take them down.
THE COURT:  For those who wish to remain anonymous?
MR. EDWARDS:  Exactly, your Honor.
THE COURT:  And that is satisfactory, as far as I am
concerned.
MR. EDWARDS:  Before we do that, I would like to
address a couple of the things that have occurred this morning.
First of all, whether relevant or not, I personally, 
and on behalf of my clients, do appreciate the presentation 
that Mr. Weingarten made and Mr. Marty Weinberg made.   
I have tremendous respect for Mr. Weinberg.  I've 
worked with him through this and related cases for years, and I 
understand the reason why they made the presentation that they 
made. 
There is two things of interest to our clients in that
respect.  One is, because of the tragic ending, that none of my
clients wanted, nor did I, nor did anyone else, if there is
some civil rights violation and there is some civil remedy for

Mr. Epstein that goes to the estate, certainly the victims are
interested in that as they might help to repair the damage
done.
Second, Mr. Epstein's untimely death, the timing is
curious to us.  But more so, it makes it absolutely impossible
for the victims to ever get the day in court that they wanted
in court and to get full justice.  That now can never happen.
I know that Mr. Epstein's attorneys say he wanted it, and they
know, we did too.  And there are a lot of people here today
that are very sad by the way that this ended for both
Mr. Epstein and the fact that full justice was robbed from
them, once again.
The second issue I wanted to address was the Law
Review or the Law Journal article that your Honor referenced,
which is troubling because the opinion seems to say that
transparency is not appropriate in the criminal system and is
not appropriate at this point in time.
That's tough to swallow, especially in this case, 
given the long history of this case.  Personally, it is tough 
to swallow, and on behalf of my clients, I can say that is very 
concerning.  Transparency is the only way that the justice 
system works.  We know this because there was a similar 
investigation of Mr. Epstein many years ago, from 2005 to 2008.   
My personal involvement in this case was because a 
young female came into my office named Courtney Wild, and she

came to me not asking to file a lawsuit against Jeffrey 
Epstein, but simply asking for the government to talk to her.  
She was cooperating in an FBI investigation and wanted the 
government to speak with her, and I thought that was going to 
be an easy task.   
It was only a few months later that we learned that 
this investigation that was represented to my client in written 
form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient.  
Basically, to hang tight.  It was resolved by way of a secret 
deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had 
been identified of Mr. Epstein's abuse in Florida to ever 
participate in a single hearing.  There was a hearing.  They 
were never notified. 
I then went on to represent many of them in civil
cases and also in extensive pro bono work.  And I can tell your
Honor that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and
harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was
aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights
in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were
treated as if they didn't matter.  They were not allowed their
rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act to meaningfully
confer with prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be
treated with dignity.  That is what this is supposed to be
about, and to have notice of hearings.
So I do want to thank your Honor, and especially the

prosecutors who have worked this investigation and this case, 
which is very different in experience for all of my clients and 
the other Epstein victims in this case, because they were 
allowed to be a part of the process.  While some of them 
elected not to be here today, that opportunity should always be 
allowed for them. 
In 2008, we filed that case under the Crime Victims'
Rights Act because our clients' rights were violated, and as
your Honor knows, a federal judge has ruled in our clients'
favor that their rights were violated.  So this hearing today
means a lot to them.  The fact that they may never get their
chance to speak in court, they may never get complete closure,
and all of us have to wonder, if their rights had been afforded
them the first time, would any of us be here right now.  Or
wouldn't it more likely be the case that everyone, including
Jeffrey Epstein, would have turned out better for it?
Today, I have not only represented, but met and become
very close with many of these victims.  Many of these
survivors.  They are very strong people.  They are people who
have persevered through a lot of adversity.  It's been a roller
coaster of emotions that has led us to where we are today.  And
while they have all been cast over the years because of the
secrecy of the first investigation, in the shadow as victims,
you can't put them all in one bucket and say one size fits all.
They are each individual people who were harmed differently and

distinctly through not only the abuse, but the system.
And on behalf of all of them, I would like to thank 
your Honor for the fairness with which they've been treated, 
and the United States Attorney's office for the way in which 
you have handled this investigation, and especially how you 
have treated the victims in this case. 
Like I said, I have many who want to speak.  Some that
can't.  This is a very difficult day for them.  But we
appreciate the opportunity and the invitation.
The first client that I have that is going to address
your Honor is the one who walked into my office in 2008 asking
just to be heard, Courtney Wild.
THE COURT:  Hold on one second.  Did you all want to
be seated?
You don't need to be standing.  Whatever is more 
comfortable until you're ready to give some comments.  It's up 
to you.   
Ms. Wild, if you could spell your name for the court 
reporters, please.

MS. WILD:  My name is Courtney Wild, and I'm a victim
of Jeffrey Epstein.  Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for
years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health.  Jeffrey
Epstein has done nothing but manipulate our justice system,
where he has never been held accountable for his actions, even
to this day.
Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other 
victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for 
that he is a coward.   
I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's for seeking 
justice that has been long over due, and most importantly, 
given us, the victims, our day in court to speak our peace and 
find some sort of closure.  I feel very angry and sad that 
justice has never been served in this case.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thanks very much.
MR. EDWARDS:  I believe my next client who is going to
speak is probably going to speak as Jane Doe.
JANE DOE NO. 1:  Yes, Jane Doe.

record.
JANE DOE NO. 1:  Okay.  Thank you for allowing us to
speak today.  I've shifted what I want to say in hearing
what's already been said, and just about the question of
Jeffrey's death.  I don't know what the relevance is to this
hearing, but I do know that it is profoundly relevant to my

life, as a victim.  I don't like that word, but I still feel
like I am learning the ways that he's impacted me as a complex
situation, but he was also a major part of my life.  As
destructive as that relationship was and as much of a villain
as we have created him to be -- based on facts we've created
him to be a villain -- he's a complex villain and actually all
of that is irrelevant.  Anybody deserves -- an investigation is
the right thing to do.  Like, we do need to know how he died.
It felt like a whole new trauma all over again, and I 
don't know why, you know, because I -- I'm trying to defend 
myself against him at this point in my life, but it still does 
not feel good.  It didn't feel good to wake up that morning and 
find out that he had allegedly committed suicide.  Okay.  But I 
also wanted to say to the press, I'm reading -- I read my story 
in the paper.  I read so many other girls' stories that are so 
similar to my own, and everything that's been focused on is not 
the most important part of it.   
There was -- the problem with focusing on these, the 
facts of the situation, that were out of the ordinary and like 
because he was such a grand person, and it was just a unique 
situation.  I know that that's the more interesting side of the 
story, but I don't want to be used as entertainment.  And the 
problem, the fundamental problem of the whole situation is the 
element of exploitation and coercion, and these are things that 
so many girls can relate to.

And even though this Jeffrey Epstein brought it to a 
grand scale, on some level, a lot of girls could relate to the 
trauma that we are talking about, and even though this whole 
situation sucks, I would like to think that it may be possibly 
a catalyst for change because, obviously, as we're seeing with 
the "Me Too" movement, change needs to happen and it's -- what 
I'm seeing in the papers is not a common story, but it's so 
much more common than you realize.  That's all.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.
MR. EDWARDS:  I believe that the next client is going
to also be a Jane Doe; so I think for the purposes of the
record it will be Jane Doe 2.
THE COURT:  Yes.
JANE DOE NO. 2:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.  How are you?
JANE DOE NO. 2:  Doing okay.  I hadn't prepared any
words to speak today, but there is something that was on my
mind this morning when I got here.  It's been on my mind in
reading through the press and through the people that I've
spoken to about it, friends, family.  It's something that's
bothered me because I think it has a lot of blame in it, as
well, a little bit of what my friend, who was up here, was
speaking about.
I think that a lot of people asked why we spent so 
much time, why we stayed.  It's an experience that's really

hard to explain to people who haven't gone through it.  I think 
there's a writer, Thomas Nagel, who wrote an essay called "What 
is it like to be a bat?"  And I think that he touches on it 
pretty strongly and if you haven't experienced something, it's 
very hard to fully understand why someone makes the decisions 
they do and what the circumstances were.   
I don't want to speak for all of the victims.  I think 
each of us has a different story and different circumstances 
for why we stayed in it, but for me, I think he was really 
strategic in how he approached each of us.  Things happened 
slowly over time.  We didn't -- it almost was like, putting it 
like that analogy of a frog being in a pan of water and slowly 
turning the flame up.  You didn't realize it was happening, and 
it just -- I don't think anyone can fully understand the 
experience, but I just -- the blame feels very strong.   
There's a lot of support as well, but I just want 
people to try and understand that we aren't bad people.  We 
weren't trying to -- it wasn't a situation where we were trying 
to extort money from someone.  A lot of us were in very 
vulnerable situations and in extreme poverty, circumstances 
where we didn't have anyone on our side, to speak on our 
behalf, and that's really scary.   
You start to blame yourself because, at first, you 
don't tell anyone what's happening, and it becomes your deep, 
dark secret that you tried to keep from everyone.  And I didn't

even know I was a victim until I spoke with my lawyers.  I had 
no idea.  I had so much self-hatred and doubt and just guilt 
for everything.  I still do.  I still don't feel like I deserve 
to say I'm a victim, and I think that's a big problem with our 
society right now, that people are still blaming victims, and I 
think that does need to change.

today.  I came to New York City 15 years ago to pursue modeling
from a small town.  I signed on with an agency and was excited
to pursue my passion and my dream.  Several months later, I met
a female who told me about Mr. Epstein.  She portrayed him as
an amazing man who genuinely cared for people and that he was
going to be able to help me in a modeling career.
I was excited to meet him, after hearing her talk 
about him.  He sounded like an amazing person.  An introduction 
was made at his New York home, and it is there that I was

sexually assaulted.  I left his home, after he threw me, 
basically put money on the table, and I was ashamed.  I was 
embarrassed.  This was not the way I was brought up, and I 
couldn't believe this had happened to me.   
I left and my world kind of spiraled after that.  I 
stopped going on modeling castings.  I gained weight.  I became 
depressed.  I stopped going out with my friends, and only five 
months after I had been in New York City to pursue my dream, I 
left.  I left the modeling industry, and I left New York City, 
and I totally switched my career paths.   
I buried this deep within me, and all of the new 
occurrences that have come up in the media is what brought it 
back up for me.  And I feel sickened and saddened that it took 
so many years, and God knows how many victims, for this to 
finally come out, but I'm thankful it did.  And I'm just angry 
that he's not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his 
actions.  So I thank you for your time.

wanted to express that we, the victims, we will always carry

It's something that's never going to go away.
You know, whoever we marry in our life, whatever

the future I had envisioned for myself as a young girl, and I 
think many of us here today will never fully heal from that 
pain and the heartache that we'll continue carrying with us.   
So I just wanted to say that.  It's something that 
it's irreparable.  I can't even really use a better word to 
describe that.  So thank you for hearing us today. 
THE COURT:  You're very welcome.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 5 would like to
speak.
JANE DOE NO. 5:  This is a letter that I wrote; so
it's going to be:  Dear Jeffrey, I think you are a mentally
disturbed human being.  You used your power to make me believe
at a young age that I could have my dreams of being a model.
You paid for your freedom.  You violated my rights.  You should
have to pay for them, just as anyone else.  You got a plea deal
that no one else would have been able to get.  You used your
money to get out of paying the price for your actions.
Also, as a victim, I never got to see what the

agreement was or why the special treatment got approved.  I 
think you should have been in jail for several years in 
population and live like everyone else that is mentally 
disturbed like you.  You paid for yourself to get special 
treatment while you were in jail.  I don't even think you spent 
a day in a jail as a normal human being.   
You had investigators come to my house and also went 
to my friend's house to question them.  I will never be able to 
over -- I will never be able to get over the overwhelming 
emotions and embarrassment I experienced from that trauma.  I 
needed therapy several times a week and had high stress and 
anxiety levels.   
You paid your way to make the public think that the 
girls had nothing in life going on for them.  You wanted to try 
and blame that we were lower class and that was the problem 
with the girls.  I was from a middle class family and did well 
in school.  I lived the American girl dream -- or the American 
girl life.  I went on family vacations around the world, grew 
up in a good city, and my parents are still married to this 
day.  Basically, everything you said that we didn't have in our 
life, I did.   
It all came down to I was told I was making $200 in an 
hour.  Being young, that was a lot of money, and I didn't know 
any better.  Sadly, you were the one with an illness that you 
should have to go and see a doctor and also have a mentor group

for the sickness you have.  I will continue with writing my 
book about that secret life, with all the newspaper articles of 
the case, my high school agenda book of official dates.  I'm 
basing that proof that I deposited cash after leaving 
Jeffrey's.  I still have all of the information, articles that 
I collected over the years.   
You mentally and physically traumatized me.  I went to 
therapy, and it was the best thing I did for myself.  If anyone 
only learns one thing from this case, I hope is that money 
should not let you buy your way free.  A crime is a crime and a 
victim is a victim.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, my next client is Chauntae
Davies, C-h-a-u-n-t-a-e, Davies, D-a-v-i-e-s.
MS. DAVIES:  I met Jeffrey Epstein through my first
massage teacher, a man who took me in as his apprentice to
teach me a practice I wanted to learn while in desperate search
to find a cure for a debilitating neurological disorder that I
have, which manifests into violent vomiting attacks, largely
triggered by stress.  It's called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.  
I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell.  Upon my first 
meeting of her, I wouldn't know I had been recruited until many 
years later, when I would read it in a headline.  Ghislaine and 
Jeffrey took me in.  They sent me to school.  They gave me a 
job.  They flew me around the world, introduced me to a world I

had only dreamt of and made me feel as though I had become a 
part of their family, another thing I was desperately searching 
for.   
But on my third or fourth time meeting them, they 
brought me to Jeffrey's island for the first time, and on the 
first night there, Sarah Kellen came tapping on my door late at 
night to inform me Jeffrey was ready for another massage.  My 
instincts told me this didn't feel right, but I got up and 
followed her to a villa I hadn't yet seen.  Jeffrey and 
Ghislaine's villa.   
I began my massage, trying not to let him smell my 
fear and obvious discomfort, but before I knew what was 
happening, he grabbed onto my wrist and tugged me towards the 
bed.  I tried to pull away, but he was unbuttoning my shorts 
and pulling my body onto his already naked body faster than I 
could think.  I was searching for words but all I could say was 
meek, "No, please stop," but that just seemed to excite him 
more.   
He continued to rape me, and when he was finished, he 
hopped off and went to the shower.  I pulled my shorts up, and 
I ran as fast as I could back to my own villa, my feet bloodied 
from the rocks.  I cried myself to sleep that night.   
I spent two weeks vomiting, almost to death, in a 
Los Angeles hospital after that first encounter.  Jeffrey's 
abuse would continue for the next three years, and I allowed it

to continue because I had been taken advantage of my entire 
life and had been conditioned to just accept it.   
It took me a long time to come forward, too long 
maybe, and all it took to bring -- and all that it took to 
bring this man to justice has been robbed by his death.  Every 
day, every week I've spent in the hospital since, I've suffered 
and he has won.  Every job offer that's been offered to me and 
then retracted because of my connection to this case, I have 
suffered and he has won.  Every public humiliation I have 
endured, I have suffered and he has won.  Every relationship 
that I've had to end because of the abuse that I have endured 
by the hands of this man, I have suffered and he has won.   
Every woman sitting in this room today, and all of the 
women who have yet come forward and who have not yet to come 
forward and whose lives have been affected by Jeffrey Epstein's 
sick abuse of young girls, we have all suffered, and he is 
still winning in death.   
I refuse to let this man win in death.  I couldn't 
fight back when Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me because I 
hadn't yet found my voice.  Well, I have found my voice now, 
and while Jeffrey may no longer be here to hear it, I will not 
stop fighting, and I will not be silenced anymore.  I needed 
him to hear the pain he's caused, what I've gone through 
because of him.  I wrote a 350-page book of all the pain that I 
have endured at the hands of this man that I really needed him

Please don't rob us of justice again.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, I think I have one more
client that is going to speak today, Anouska De Georgiou.
THE COURT:  Would you spell that?
MS. DE GEORGIOU:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
MS. DE GEORGIOU:  My name is spelled A-n-o-u-s-k-a,
D-e, space, G-e-o-r-g-i-o-u.
Thank you, your Honor, for giving us the opportunity 
to be heard this morning. 
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. DE GEORGIOU:  When I was introduced to Jeffrey
Epstein, I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of a
teenager.  I was idealistic, and I saw the good in people.
Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and sexually abused
me.
Something I think is very important to communicate is 
that loss of innocence, trust and joy is not recoverable.  The 
abuse, spanning several years, was devaluing beyond measure and 
affected my ability to form and maintain healthy relationships, 
both in my work and my personal life.  He could not begin to 
fathom what he took from us, and I say "us" because I am every 
girl he did this to, and they're all me.  And today we stand

together, those that are present and those that aren't.   
I was a victim, and it has taken me many, many years 
to stand here and say, yes, it was me.  I was a victim, but I 
will not remain a victim and be silent for one more day.  
Although I think it's tragic when anybody dies before their 
time, I'm extremely relieved that Jeffrey Epstein will not be 
in a position to hurt anymore children or anymore women, and 
I'm glad to be part of a group of women who are now bonded 
forever in the trauma that we endured at the hands of this man.  
Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, we had one client who was
not able to be here but sent a message through a letter.  Her
name is Michelle Licata, M-i-c-h-e-l-l-e; last name,
L-i-c-a-t-a.  And Brittany Henderson, of my office, is going to
read her letter as instructed.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. HENDERSON:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Yup.
MS. HENDERSON:  What happened to me occurred many
years ago when I was in high school, but it still effects my
life.  I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be
held accountable, but he was not.  In fact, the government
worked out a secret deal and didn't tell me about it.  The case
ended without me knowing what was going on, without him being

held responsible, without any explanation and without a chance
for my voice to be heard.  I was treated like I did not matter.
Many years later, he was arrested again.  These 
investigators and attorneys representing the United States have 
been completely different.  I am still mad, concerned and 
confused about how he committed suicide and escaped 
responsibility again, but I know it is not the fault of the 
judge or the government attorneys.   
I was allowed to be a part of the process this time.  
My attorney was able to tell me what was going on at every 
stage because they kept him informed.  Thank you for inviting 
me.  It means more to me than you can ever know.  I was not 
able to be here this time, but I know that I was allowed to be 
and I had the chance to attend this hearing, which is helping 
me in my healing process.  The fact that I mattered this time 
and the other victims mattered is what counts.  For that, I am 
grateful. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, finally, in 2008 when I
filed the case under the Crime Victims Rights Act, it wasn't me
alone.  I did it with Paul Cassell and Jay Howell.  
Paul Cassell is here today, and I think your Honor 
even cited to a piece of -- an opinion of his from when he was 
on the bench, and he has some remarks to make.   
Once again, your Honor, I really do believe that this

is a model for how victims should be treated in a criminal 
process, and we really do appreciate it.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. CASSELL:  I'll be very brief because I know there
are others that want to speak here.  I'm Paul Cassell,
C-a-s-s-e-l-l, previously served as a federal judge at the
District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach
crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law.  
I just wanted to take one minute to address some 
suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this 
morning.  I think, having heard already from these powerful 
victims and recognizing how important giving those statements 
will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your 
Honor has followed exactly the right path.  Legally, there is 
one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited 
that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that 
opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal 
justice system that can only be recognized if they're given 
their day in court.   
With all due respect to other law professors that have 
recently written an article, I think transparency is one of the 
overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the 
one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take 
today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion.  The 
Heaton case is, to my knowledge, the only reported decision on

J8RPEPS2                 
this particular issue, even though it's more than a decade old 
and, yet, we can see today that these problems recur in many 
other cases.  Your remarks today, I think, should be published 
so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the 
country.   
I would encourage you to add into your remarks a 
reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act.  The Crime Victims 
Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with 
fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see 
unfolding this morning is a clear example of how victims can be 
treated with fairness, dignity and respect.   
So I know that your Honor is wondering what is the 
appropriate action here.  Unfortunately, it seems like there 
are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for 
you to decide to exercise, which was to allow these victims to 
come forward.  And if there's been one positive thing that has 
come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this 
case, it's been your decision to allow these victims to be 
heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your 
decision and to encourage other judges to follow what is 
clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an 
example that should be followed in other cases down the road. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate your
being here.  I had no idea that you would be here when I wrote
the remarks, but it was clear from the literature that you are

the leading expert formerly of the District Court of Utah, I
believe, and it's a pleasure to have you here today.
MR. CASSELL:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thanks.
Mr. Boies? 
MR. BOIES:  Thank you, your Honor.  David Boies of
Boies Schiller Flexner.  We have with us today five of the
victims that we represent.  There are a number of additional
victims who either were unable to attend or are still unwilling
to come forward publicly.  This has been an enormously
traumatic aspect of their lives, something that, as you've
already heard and will hear more today, is something that they
can never entirely escape from.
I want to, as prior counsel have, commend both the 
Court and counsel for the Department of Justice for the 
consideration and respect and attention that they have paid to 
the victims.  We believe that that is not only right, as a 
matter of human dignity, but we think that is exactly what the 
law requires and intends.   
I will be more blunt than the Court has been, or 
Professor Cassell has been about Professor Green's article.  
That is an article that cites no authority, and I believe there 
is no authority for his proposition.  I entirely respect his 
right to advocate on behalf of his client Alan Dershowitz, who 
has retained him in connection with litigation that we've

brought against Mr. Dershowitz, but I would have expected that 
the Law Journal or Professor Green himself would have disclosed 
that connection, which I think is a conflict.   
But regardless of the appropriateness of his 
disclosure, or lack of disclosure, I think that his article 
opposing allowing the victims to have a voice in this 
proceeding is inconsistent not only with the policy that 
underlies the Crime Victim Rights Act and the very statute that 
Mr. Epstein is being prosecuted under, but it ignores the 
actual language of those statutes, and many other statutes, in 
which Congress has made clear that the purpose of the criminal 
law is no longer simply to punish the individual defendant, but 
it is to find some way of trying to mitigate the damage that 
has been done to the victims through restitution and economic 
mitigation, but also through the ability to confront and to 
have the court system and the justice system and the 
prosecutors treat these victims as they are victims, as they 
are human beings, and they are entitled to the respect that our 
society needs to give every human being.  So I think that this 
is not only commendable, but I think it is what the law 
requires. 
In response to the question the Court asked, I have
discussed this hearing with my clients.  I have told them that,
under the applicable law, the government has no alternative but
to move to dismiss this case, and I believe under the

applicable law in this circuit, the Court has no alternative
but to grant that motion.
I think the current law is outdated, as the Court 
suggested in some of its remarks.  I think there will come a 
time when either an Appellate court or the Congress will make 
clear that, just as it's possible to continue civil cases 
against someone after they have deceased, it is possible, at 
least for purposes of things like restitution, to continue 
criminal cases, but we are not there now.  And, fortunately, in 
this case, there are other ways and perhaps even more efficient 
ways to vindicate the interests of the victims here.   
We greatly appreciate the remarks of the 
representative of the Department of Justice today, and we, too, 
on behalf of the victims, are not going to stop when we walk 
out of this courtroom.  We are going to continue to seek 
vindication against Mr. Epstein's estate and, in some senses, 
perhaps even more important, against the people who worked with 
him and enabled him.   
As you have already heard, and will hear more, 
Mr. Epstein did not act alone.  He could not have done what he 
did, on the scope and the scale of what he did, for as many 
years as he did it without the activities and support and the 
co-conspirator activity of a number of other key individuals, 
and those individuals also need to bear their share of 
responsibility, and those people need to have a reckoning as

speak briefly to your Court.  Thank you very much. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Boies.  Pleasure
to have you here.
 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor, the first victim
that would like to speak today is Theresa J. Helm.
THE COURT:  Can we have the spelling of your name?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.  Sigrid, S-i-g-r-i-d, and the
last name is M-c-C-a-w-l-e-y, and I'm a partner at Boies
Schiller Flexner.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MS. HELM:  Good morning.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
MS. HELM:  Thank you, prosecutors and Judge, and the
Court.  My name is Theresa Helm.  I note today I do feel
respected and listened to; so I appreciate that, and I have to
say that I commend the boldness of the New York prosecutors for
pursuing a man that has, you know -- and others, that have
clearly taken a lot from a lot of people.
17 years ago I knew him only as "Jeffrey."  I was 
recruited and brought from California to New York, and that

experience for the last 17 years has been a dark corner in my 
story, in my life, in my life story and that has been 
definitely made worse by my own self-shame and that -- and 
anger for normalizing all of the red flags.  I feel like we are 
conditioned to do that, and that's something that needs to 
change.   
So I'm here today, you know, I'm coming forward 
because it is time to bring light to that darkness, and it's 
time to replace that darkness with light.  And I am a survivor 
of this, and I do aim to progress further from being a 
survivor, you know.  I feel I've worked hard, quite hard, to 
get to where I'm at now, and I'm definitely at a place in my 
life where I will no longer cover up.  I'll no longer cover up 
what needs to be brought to light.   
Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped 
him are, Ghislaine Maxwell.  My experience is with Ghislaine 
Maxwell and Sarah Kellen, and they definitely need to be held 
accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one 
another carry on this huge, almost like a system.  So they need 
to be held accountable, all of them, and I would like to see 
that, certainly on behalf of myself and for everyone here.  
Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thanks so much.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Our next client, who is going to speak
this morning, is Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

MS. GIUFFRE:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.  How are you?
MS. GIUFFRE:  Okay.  Thank you.  My name is Virginia
Roberts Giuffre, that's V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a, Roberts,
R-o-b-e-r-t-s, Giuffre, G-i-u, double F, for Fred, -r-e.
I am a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell 
in the dark and cruel and criminal acts they committed against 
me and hundreds of other girls and young women for years and 
years and years, unstopped.   
Thank you for allowing me to address the Court and 
speak the truth.  I commend the prosecutors from the Southern 
District of New York for the ongoing investigation and its 
pursuit of justice for us victims.  It has given me hope, and I 
will not let go of that hope. 
When I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at
Mar-a-Lago, just before I was 17, I thought I was given a big
break, and I'd be able to reset my life and become an actual
real massage therapist.  My hopes were quickly dashed, and my
dreams were stolen.  Jeffrey Epstein is no longer alive, but
this is not about how he died.  This is about how he lived.
He will not have his day in court, but the reckoning 
of accountability has begun, supported by the voices of these 
brave and beautiful women in this courtroom today.  The 
reckoning must not end.  It must continue.  He did not act 
alone and we, the victims, know that.  We trust the government

Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.
MS. McCAWLEY:  The next client of ours that will be
speaking this morning is Sarah Ransome.
MS. RANSOME:  Thank you, your Honor.  My name is Sarah
Ransome, R-a-n-s-o-m-e.  I'm a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and
Ghislaine Maxwell's international sex trafficking ring.
I would like to thank the Court for the dignity and 
the respect you are showing me here today, as well as the other 
victims.  I would also like to acknowledge and extend my 
gratitude to the prosecutors from the Southern District of 
New York for pursuing justice on behalf of the victims.  
Please, please finish what you have started.  I struggled to 
find the words to adequately say how important your work is to 
us.   
For a very long time Jeffrey Epstein gamed the system 
at every level, and when he realized he couldn't do that any 
longer, he showed the world what a depraved and cowardly human 
being he is by taking his own life.  But we, the victims, are 
still here, prepared to tell the truth, and we all know he did 
not act alone.  We are survivors, and the pursuit of justice 
should not abate.  Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  You're very welcome.

MS. FARMER:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
MS. FARMER:  Annie, A-n-n-i-e, Farmer, F-a-r-m-e-r.
I had the opportunity to speak at Jeffrey Epstein's
bail hearing, and I really appreciate that you heard me and
listened to me that day.  I am so sorry that others will not
have the opportunity to stand before him the way that I did.
But I'm here today to speak on behalf of my sister, Maria
Farmer, who could not be here.
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted 
her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women 
here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood.  She 
risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them, 
to no avail, and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all 
this destruction has been wrought since that time.   
We were deeply disappointed and disturbed by Epstein's 
death and the fact that that was allowed to happen while he was 
in the government's custody, and I'm encouraged to hear that 
there will be a full investigation as to how that was allowed 
to happen.   
But it is extremely important, as others are saying, 
that he did not act alone and that the other people that were a 
part of what he did are held accountable and that that 
investigation continues.

I believe that we have a real problem in this country 
with perpetrators of sexual abuse and sexual assault being held 
accountable.  There are so many roadblocks to victims being 
heard, to cases being investigated thoroughly, and then to 
those cases being prosecuted.  And so I think this is a really 
important signal to send a message to victims out there that 
people will take you seriously, people will follow through, and 
that even those in power, as we have unfortunately seen, that 
has not been often are able to escape that, that even those in 
power will be held accountable.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thanks so much.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Our next client, who's going to address
the Court is Marijke Chartouni.  She says it much more
beautifully than I do; so I'll let her say it.
MS. CHARTOUNI:  My first name is spelled,
M-a-r-i-j-k-e; last name is C-h-a-r-t-o-u-n-i.
My name is Marijke Chartouni, and I am a victim of
Jeffrey Epstein and the sophisticated sex trafficking operation
he ran, where he allegedly was to be a financier.
I was 20 and previously modeled and was living in the 
West Village.  I met a young woman named Rena through a mutual 
friend.  We were friends for a few months.  She was an amazing 
artist and liked to party.  One day she called me and asked if 
I was interested in meeting a friend of hers.  She told me he 
wanted to meet me and really liked blonds, and I thought he was

our age and liked to do the same things we did at that age; so 
I agreed.   
On a sunny, crisp day, we took the train together to 
the Upper East Side.  She then began to talk a little bit about 
him on our way to his house.  I was at his house.  I was 
sexually assaulted by both Rena and Jeffrey Epstein in his 
mansion.  It left me feeling both disgusted and betrayed.   
As we walked home to the subway afterwards, she 
continued to tell me about the man who had just abused me with 
her participation.  She seemed exhilarated from the horrific 
experience.  I was shocked and in a daze.  This is a few things 
that she had told me.  She told me he went to Cooper Union.  He 
was a mathematical genius.  That he had favorite girls that he 
would take to Chanel for 15-minute, all-you-can-buy shopping 
trips.  She told me his right-hand person had connection to the 
arts and the fashion world, and she could help me.   
This is not my complete story.  I'll stop here.  I'm 
in a good, stable place in my life, and I had decided to come 
forward to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to 
tell their story, or at least not yet.  I feel like I am a 
survivor.   
Thank you, Judge Berman, for inviting victims to speak 
today before you.  We hope the government is listening very 
closely to the words we are saying. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.

MR. BOIES:  Your Honor, just very briefly.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. BOIES:  I would like to express to the Court how
proud I am of all of these women who have come forward.  It's
taken an enormous amount of strength and courage for them to do
so.  Thank you.

MS. LERNER:  Thank you, your Honor.  My name is
Kimberly Lerner, of Lerner and Lerner, and your Honor, with

MS. LERNER:  Would that be okay?
THE COURT:  Absolutely.

saying that I am in awe of all of these beautiful women.  I
just want to let you know, on behalf of Jennifer and myself, we
admire you, we respect you, and we applaud you, and you are
brave survivors.  And Jennifer's heart is with all of you, and
we thank you so much for coming forward.
Jennifer, when she went public, she thought she was 
one of the only ones, and to see all of these faces is, I know, 
amazing for her.

individual.  However, he was also a thief.  He stole Jennifer's
childhood dreams, her innocence and her self-confidence.  She
was 14 years old.  What he could not buy, he forcibly took.
Why?  Because he surrounded himself with a network of powerful
people who not only looked the other way, but also actively
facilitated and participated in his sexual abuse of children.
Jeffrey Epstein thought he was above the law, and 
essentially he was until now.  The system let Jennifer and the 
other victims down, but it does not have to end here.  We ask 
the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI to bring all of 
Epstein's enablers and co-conspirators to justice.   
It has taken Jennifer 18 years to find her voice, and 
again, Jeffrey Epstein has tried to silence her.  While she 
will never have her chance to face him in court, he no longer 
has any power over her.  Today, this brave survivor will be 
heard.   
MS. AROZ:  Thank you for allowing me to be able to
have my chance in court today, to be able to tell you what this
horrific man did to my life.  You can't even imagine how much
it affected my childhood, all the way through my adult life.
He robbed me of my dreams.  He robbed me of my chance to pursue
a career I always adored.  He stole my chance at really feeling
love because I was so scared to trust anyone for so many years
that I had such severe anxiety.  I didn't want to leave my
house let alone my bed.

The fact that he felt entitled to take away my 
innocence, the fact that he felt that he could do whatever he 
wanted, regardless of the laws, hurts me so very much.  It took 
me years to tell anyone what Epstein did to me because I was so 
ashamed and embarrassed at what people would say or think of me 
until I found out there were other victims, girls just like me.  
I knew I could no longer keep my silence no matter how ruthless 
and powerful Epstein was, and still is even after his death.   
The fact I will never have a chance to face my 
predator in court eats away at my soul.  Even in death, Epstein 
is trying to hurt me.  I had hoped to at last get an apology, 
but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to 
anyone.  I felt let down by the people who were supposed to 
watch him in prison.  They let this man kill himself and kill 
the chance of justice for so many others in the process, taking 
away our ability to speak.   
Out of all the damages and side effects that Epstein 
caused by his heartless and selfish acts, it's very hard to put 
my feelings and emotions into words, trying to let his 
horrendous actions go and attempting to forgive him, has been 
so difficult for me.  Yet, as hard as it's been to come so 
publicly forward, I refuse to let Epstein take me as a victim 
anymore.   
I am a survivor.  The many that stand before me here 
today that have shared the horrific experiences with this

attorney.  I'm not admitted to the New York State bar.  I am
here to make a statement on behalf of New York attorney, Lisa
Bloom.  I work for her firm, The Bloom Firm.
Lisa Bloom represents four of Jeffrey Epstein's 
victims, Jane Doe 6, for the record, Jane Doe 7 and Jane Doe 8.  
I am so proud of all of you victims who are here today and are 
able to voice yourselves today.  I will not and cannot comment 
on the criminal case, or Ms. Bloom's communications with her 
clients.   
Ms. Bloom would like to share three of her client's 
statements for the record.  Here are the statements.  Statement 
of Jane Doe 6.   
To the Honorable Richard M. Berman.  Jeffrey Epstein 
stole my innocence.  He gave me a life sentence of guilt and 
shame.  I do not consider myself a victim.  I see myself a 
survivor.  The abuse that I endured cannot continue.  Let's 
stop this before it happens to other young women.  Jane Doe.

Statement of Jane Doe 7.  To the Honorable Richard M.
Berman.  I used to be relatively carefree, inquisitive, hopeful
and excited about life, but my life changed because of Jeffrey
Epstein.  My perspective on life became very dark when I was
unknowingly recruited by one of his agents.  Jeffrey Epstein
ruined me.  His recruiter ruined me.  The far-reaching
consequences of that day ruined my family's lives.
I've chosen to remain anonymous in order to protect my 
family from unwanted media attention.   
I was just trying to figure out my path in life when I 
encountered Jeffrey Epstein in his New York City mansion.  I 
cannot even begin to summarize the many detriments this 
experience of sexual assault has had on my life.  Immediately 
following the incident, I was unable to function and be around 
other people.  My parents had to rescue me and bring me home, 
where I became a recluse for years.   
I was changed forever and buried my assault deep down, 
where the darkness couldn't hurt me anymore, but of course, it 
has always been here, lingering and affecting me unconsciously.  
At the time, I was mired in shame, guilt and humiliation.  I 
had somehow tricked myself into thinking that I had allowed the 
assault to happen, that I did it to myself, that I don't 
deserve to be alive or to be loved.  I believed that I was a 
disgusting, shameful person who does not deserve to ever be 
happy.  These are the thoughts I've lived with on a daily

basis.   
Furthermore, because I couldn't tell anyone, out of 
fear of judgment, blame or retaliation, keeping this secret 
completely hindered my ability to uncover why these issues 
existed for me, which could have led to a path of healing over 
the years.   
It is time for those of power to do the right thing.  
It is time for compassion toward our fellow human beings to 
reign over money, power and greed.  We need to protect our most 
vulnerable to allow them a chance at a normal life, and nothing 
should come in the way of that.  I believe that for future 
generations, including my own children, this case will set a 
precedent that victims must no longer suffer in silence on our 
own or be shamed for coming forward to seek protection.   
This case should demonstrate to those who want to harm 
others that there will be a reckoning, and they will pay dearly 
for the harm they inflict on innocent people.  Judge Berman, I 
thank you for from the bottom of my heart for this forum and 
opportunity.   
To all of those survivors who came before me, I 
commend your bravery.  There is no way I could have done this 
without you.   
Thank you to the public following this story, for your 
outrage and desire for answers, which will hopefully move this 
case forward so that victims can stop having to relive their

THE COURT:  Thanks very much.
MS. GIBBS:  One more.  Statement of Jane Doe 8.
In the past few weeks, I have had to reflect on my 
interaction with Jeffrey Epstein and realized that, though I 
have yet to put it all behind me, I am still a victim.  I say 
this because I have to come to terms with it in an effort to 
truly get past the abuse I suffered at the hands of Epstein. 
Pursuing criminal penalties against him and having an
opportunity to address the egregious crimes he committed
against me and other young woman would have helped my recovery
process.  This all came to an abrupt halt when he took his own
life.  This point of disclosure is lost.
I cannot say that I am pleased he committed suicide,
but I am at peace knowing he will not be able to hurt anyone
else.  However, a sad truth remains.  I, along with other
people, will never have an answer as to why.  I will never have
an apology for the wrongdoing.  And most importantly, Epstein
will not be justly sentenced for his crimes.  Now I sit in my
home questioning the well-being of those girls like myself.  In
choosing death, Epstein denied everyone justice.
Any efforts made to protect Epstein's name and legacy
send a message to the victims that he wins and that he is
untouchable.  I understand his case may be dismissed or closed,
but this makes me feel as though I, and anyone else who fell
pry to his hands, simply do not matter.

I ask that you very seriously consider the final
decision, because it will undoubtedly affect all other facets
of this case, including any future charges brought against the
recruiters or third parties to his crimes.  I do not want the
narrative to be, Those poor girls.  I want to send a message to
anyone who would consider engaging in similar acts to think
twice beforehand.  I want some sort of closure for those of us
who relive those horrible moments where we were assaulted,
abused, and taken advantage of by Epstein.
You have the opportunity to help us seek that closure.
I appreciate your time and consideration and ask for your
continued support in dealing with this case to illustrate that
we, Epstein's victims, do matter.
Sincerely, Jane Doe 8. 
On behalf of Lisa Bloom and The Bloom Firm, thank you,
your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Gibbs.
Did we have any other victim's counsel or victims?

afford the victims their voice, because many of them have never
spoken before.  They never spoke in Florida.  They never spoke
anywhere.  They never told their mother.  They never told their
father.  They never told their family members.  This is an
opportunity for them to be heard.  We thank you for that.
Your Honor, for 43 years my firm has been the leading
women's rights private law firm in the United States.  We have
helped thousands of victims.  And I, as an officer of the
court, and as a believer in the system, have tried to encourage
the victims to have confidence in the system that should
provide them access to justice that should help them to assert
and vindicate their rights in a court of law.  It has been
increasingly difficult in this case for me to say to my clients
that they should have confidence in the system of justice given
what has occurred in this case, People v. Jeffrey Epstein.  
Having said that, I am encouraged by the fact that 
this court, essentially, in an unprecedented situation where 
the defendant is deceased, is still affording these victims an 
opportunity to be heard.  So we thank you for that.  It is some 
encouragement. 
Your Honor, you also asked do our clients wish to be
heard in reference to some of the issues that have been raised
this morning, including what should happen into this case.
Your Honor, there has been a suggestion that the court should
investigate the circumstances of the death of Mr. Epstein.  I'm

not going to repeat the arguments made by counsel, but I would
say that if there is jurisdiction, and I know that is a legal
issue which has been previously argued, that certainly it would
increase the confidence of my clients.  Not just my clients,
but victims all over, and some are, by the way, located in
other parts of the world, to have the court oversee the
investigation.
We are encouraged by the sensitivity of the attorneys 
for the United States Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York and the investigation that is going on 
with the separate team.  However, and, of course, the defense 
is also conducting its own investigation.  But I do think the 
greatest confidence would be if the court in some way would be 
able to oversee an investigation because the court is a neutral 
party.  And although the court certainly has a stake in finding 
out what happened to defendants who are in the custody of the 
federal system and who should be there to face the prosecutors 
and the charges against them, but now are not because clearly 
the system has failed. 
And the United States Attorney has admitted that, and
even before he admitted that, everybody knows the system
failed.  Failed the victims, failed the court, failed everyone.
In any event, your Honor, having seen so many
thousands of victims of gender violence, sex harassment, sexual
assault, I've dealt with child sex trafficking, child

molesters, I mean, this is a unique case because there are so
many victims and so many failures of the system.  At this
point, what we would really ask for is not just words, but
words have been helpful, but deeds, and that is very important.
In addition, I would like to say, throughout this case
is the running theme of the betrayal of trust.  Betrayal of
trust by Jeffrey Epstein.  Betrayal of trust by the system.
And betrayal of trust to the victims who had a right to
justice.  And the Crime Victims' Act should not just be words,
it should have meaning and it should be enforced.
In essence, we are asking, although you may need to,
of course, grant this motion to dismiss, I think because the
court has shown sensitivity to victims and victims' needs, if
there is a way to at least keep the record open so that victims
who have not been able to be physically present in the
courtroom today and who have not been able to submit to the
court any letters, victim impact, and who have not been able to
secure attorneys or speak to attorneys yet -- so, for example,
I'll still hearing from victims who I have not been able to
meet with yet because they just recently are now contacting
me -- so if they could submit, at least for the record, their
victim impact statements, that, I think, would be a very
important assistance to them.  So that would be, at least they
would know that what they are sharing is on the record.
So, in summary, I would say that they are looking

forward to the very serious investigation by the United States
Attorney of who may have conspired in this case, and that is
very hopeful, and we're hoping that everyone who may have a
role to this criminal prosecution will submit that evidence.
This is about power.  This is about many victims 
having lived in fear -- fear of the rich, the powerful, the 
famous, fear that the system will not afford them justice.  So 
fear of not coming forward.  And fear, of course, is a weapon 
that the rich, powerful, famous, and sexual predators used to 
silence the victims.  But that is gone for a lot of victims 
because they refuse to suffer in silence. 
Finally, it does take courage to speak truth to power.
We thank this honorable court for giving these victims a voice.
We thank them, even after the death of the defendant, for
showing respect for the victims, allowing them dignity,
allowing them a voice.  We do want truth, we do want justice,
we do want accountability, and we do want those conspirators to
face the justice system.
Your Honor, right now we have two of our clients who
would like to address the court.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. ALLRED:  Then I have a couple of statements on
victims who do not wish to address the court.
As they come up, we'll give them the opportunity to
say either their name or Jane Doe.

MS. ALLRED:  Thank you.
MS. DAVIES:  Hello.  My name is Teala Davies.  That is
T-e-a-l-a D-a-v-i-e-s.
I was going to start this statement by saying that I
was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein.  But that's not the case.  I'm
still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein.  I'm still a victim because
the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling my story
for so many years.  This lingering fear almost stopped me from
attending this monumental movement of strength and power.
I'm still a victim because I am fearful for my 
daughters and everyone's daughters.  I'm fearful for their 
future in this world, where there are predators in power, a 
world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep 
enough. 
I'm still a victim because the 17-year-old Teala was
manipulated into thinking she had found someone who cared,
someone who wanted to help.  Jeffrey knew I had nowhere to go.
He knew I was vulnerable, and he took advantage of that poor
girl, who will never be the same.
I cannot eat at the thought that Jeffrey Epstein -- I

cannot eat at the thought of Jeffrey Epstein not serving the
time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so
many vulnerable young girls.  He thought he was untouchable,
and honestly, so did I.  I thought he was the most powerful
person I would ever meet.
But the end is here and here I stand becoming more 
powerful than he will ever be.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
JANE DOE:  Jane Doe.
Um, in 2004, when I was 15 years old, I flew on
Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual
molested by him for many hours.  What I remember most vividly
was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for
me and how much he was helping me to grow.  Yikes.
I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially 
after he positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was 
confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him 
smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.   
After he finished with me, he told me to describe in 
detail how good my first sexual experience felt.  That was the 
first of many lies I was forced to carry for him, the weight of 
which proliferated my trauma.  I felt powerless not merely 
because one man wanted to strip me of my innocence, but because 
I was the victim of a system that just enfranchises human 
beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.

As unjust as what happened to me was, I believe that
experience to be a symptom of insidious and pathological
violence that extreme wealth yields, a violence which
ultimately stays hidden through channels of extreme power that
serve it.
I first identified with this feeling the night after I 
was molested by Epstein, when another girl and I took out two 
of his ATVs and raised them across the mesa.  I crashed mine 
and expressed my concern to the other girl of getting in 
trouble, which she replied to me, Don't worry, no one gets in 
trouble for anything here. 
Even as a child, I understood, in a sad and precocious
way, what I hoped we have the ability of changing now.  Even
though Epstein is dead, there is still justice to be brought
for the crimes we felt powerless against concealing for him and
the system that supported him for all these years.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  You're very welcome.
MS. ALLRED:  Thank you.
Your Honor, may it please the court.  I would like to
read a statement for Jane Doe, my client, who is present in

opportunity to develop.  One opportunity to find direction for
our lives.  Jeffrey Epstein robbed and denied me at each

opportunity he had.
I came from a small Texas town, not far from the New 
Mexico border.  My mother died when I was 11, after suffering 
from cancer for many years.  My father was devastated, as were 
my siblings and I.  My father was saddled with debt.  My only 
hope for college was to get a scholarship.   
When I was 15, I was a blossoming freshman in high 
school and was trying to carry on my mother's dream.  She 
wanted me to master the violin.  After school, I would often go 
to a mall in a nearby city.  A lady approached me and saw I had 
a violin case with me and asked if I was any good.  We talked 
about the violin, my family, and why I had clothes that looked 
like hand-me-downs.   
The lady told me she works for a very rich man who had 
a home close by and that he would pay to hear me play.  I was 
told that if I could get away, she could arrange for 
transportation to and from his place and have me back before 
anyone knew I was gone.  After some hesitation, I agreed.  This 
decision was the beginning of the end of my childhood. 
The man who only identified himself as J or Jeff had
asked if I would give him a massage, and over four visits,
eventually progressed to forced oral copulation.  The money he
gave me further placed my young soul into a perverse sense of
hell.
I was so utterly disgusted with myself and what he did

to me that I stopped going to see him.  I had documented the 
events with a Texas rape crisis center about the man I know now 
as Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein targeted and took advantage of me, a young
girl, whose mother had recently died a horrific death and whose
family structure had deteriorated.  His actions placed me, a
young girl, into a downward spiral to the point where I
purchased a gun and drove myself to an isolated place to end my
suffering.
A voice that could only have been from my mother told
me, quote, I am not the victim, I am the victor, and I dare not
pull the trigger." I returned the gun days later.
Epstein is a coward.  He lived his life leaching off
the souls of inspiring, young girls due to the fact that he
could never know how it feels inspired to live.  Like a leach,
once Epstein had his fill, he would unlatch and seek out
another victim.
The only sense of justice I had hoped to see was 
Epstein being sentenced.  However, Epstein died as he lived, 
taking the easy way out without any responsibility. 
Your Honor, the next statement is also a statement of
a Jane Doe.  May it please the court.
I was a 16-year-old virgin when Jeffrey Epstein first
raped me.  I was naive and gullable.  He was a pillar of
finance and a giant in the world that I was an insignificant

part of.  I was so impressed that this great man would even
talk to me and impart any of his wisdom on me.  I gladly jumped
at the chance to meet him again, when he told me how impressed
he was with my personal story and maturity for my age.
When I was in his presence, he made an effort to call 
celebrities and influential people on speakerphone, like 
Academy Award-winning actresses and super models, who always 
answered his calls.  Sadly, I was impressed.   
He was friends with former and future heads of states 
and every other fixture in the New York social scene and 
beyond.  He knew important people in my own world that I looked 
up to and revered, but he spoke about them like they were sweet 
distractions far beneath his stature.  He could easily reach 
down from his position and influence the people directly 
involved with my daily life and future prosperity.  I was the 
perfect victim. 
My whole life was extremely turbulent.  But one of my
mother's greatest wishes was that all her children would
graduate from respectable universities.  He promised me that he
would write me a letter of recommendation for Harvard if I got
the grades and scores needed for admission.  His word was worth
a lot, he assured me, as he was in the midst of funding and
leading Harvard's studies on the human brain, and the president
was his friend.

details, which I'll share, should ignite fire instead of induce
the complacency they did in the past, when heard repeatedly
over the years, but yes, an innocent massage turned sexual
almost immediately.
"Here, come.  Come help me with a kink in my shoulder
while we finish our discussion."  A large vibrator and a couple
of hundred dollars, disgust and dirty secret, more praise and
imparted wisdom from a godlike figure, a deliberate diabolical
depression of grooming and submission for his pleasure and
release.  Even if I resisted, I was no match for him.  I felt
powerless, ashamed, and embarrassed.  I wanted to vomit
remembering these moments.
What I learned in those depraved sessions, staring up
at the dome ceiling in his private massage room, tore a violent
hole through any normal sexual awakening.  I'm haunted forever,
having learned everything there is to know about sex through a
vile criminal.  Every time a new molestation would bring a new
lesson, the progressive and constant unwinding.  I was nothing
more than a teenage prostitute.  I was his slave.
I had never even kissed a boy before I met him, and
never throughout the horrific abuse did Jeffrey Epstein kiss me
even once.  When he stole my virginity, he washed my entire
body compulsively in the shower and then told me, "If you're
not a virgin, I will kill you."  And then I wasn't a virgin
anymore.

He forcefully penetrated me.  I was numb.  There was
pain, but his use of the vibrator and his fingers in previous
sessions with me had left a black hole-like void between my
legs.  I protested, but he forced my face into the bed to
stifle my cries.  That was my first time.
I got a few hundred dollars, as usual, as he led me
out of his mansion with assurances that I was on the right path
guided by him.  I lied to myself and tried to believe him.  I
became a hollow shell.  If I missed an appointment, he
threatened me and let me know who was in charge. "Do you know
how important my time is?  I'll bury you.  I owe this -- I
won't say the word -- F'ing town."  He would hang up.
I would stand there frozen in the street, terrified 
that his assistant would call to reschedule.  I made sure to 
stay in line and not disobey him.  I was in complete denial.  
Being paid after every scheduled meeting felt routine and 
disgusting.  He was the master of the universe and the world 
bent to his will.   
He would eventually brag to his assistants about my 
ability to please him sexually right in front of me, leaving me 
feeling grotesque and worthless.  Everything in my outside life 
was falling apart.  I distanced myself from friends and grew 
further away from my family.  I felt less human after each 
ordeal.  My psyche broke down completely and wouldn't let me 
continue.

One day I walked out of his residence and passed a 
girl similar to myself.  When I turned around, she was entering 
Jeffrey's residence.  He no longer even tried to schedule his 
appointments with other girls in secrecy from me.  Maybe he 
never did.  I was too stupid to see. 
My world shattered.  I had been so naive.  I had an
epiphany in a calvary of desperation.  I realized I was just
one of many young girls he had in rotation come to perform for
him for money.  I went into a deep depression and never lifted
completely.  I wanted to inflict pain on myself.  I was
humiliated, angry, and suicidal.  I locked myself away from
everything.  I cut myself off forever from the world I had
known.
I endured the daily agony of knowing my life would
never be the same.  I could never go back to New York City and
the wonderful life I had taken for granted before I met this
demon named Jeffrey Epstein.
This creature had manipulated and outwitted the whole
system, including some of the most intelligent scientists,
political people, prosecutors, and power players.  How easy was
it to manipulate a 16-year-old virgin who never had a boyfriend
and came from a background of hardship with no parental
guidance or support.
I went to therapy and was given antidepressants for 
severe anxiety and depression.  My only solace, years later,

was my desire to succeed on my own terms.  I emersed myself 
into my studies and was accepted to every college I applied to, 
graduating from a top university.  To this day, there is still 
an ache in my being that I did not apply to Harvard in fear of 
his influence there.   
They say you never forget your first.  I'm in a 
never-ending nightmare trying to do just that.  I'm forever 
suffering because everything reminds me of that horror.  This 
new wave of worldwide publicity only worsens my despair.   
It was only many years later that I was finally 
intimate with a man again, and those moments were marred by my 
actions as a child with Jeffrey Epstein.  Even now is 
impossible to separate his treachery from any care of a good 
man.   
For one brief moment there was elation when he was 
recently arrested.  I would finally get my chance to see him 
again face to face and show him what I had become, that I had 
succeeded on my own, that I was worth something in spite of his 
abuse, and that I had surmounted the monumental obstacles he 
laid before me throughout my entire life since falling prey to 
him.   
I had hoped humanity would prevail, but it seems to me 
that he outsmarted everyone so far, and his ghost is still 
laughing at us.  I appeal to all of those just and true that 
his evil legacy and his death not stand in the way of

Thank you, your Honor.
And then just one last one, and this is much shorter.
Statement of Jane Doe, also my client.
I was a model in another country when I came to the
United States.  I was told by a booker that I needed to meet
with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the owner of
Victoria's Secret.  The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could
help me get into Victoria Secret's world.
It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret 
model.  So I went one day in the afternoon and I met 
Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York.  A woman 
introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be 
extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would 
probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away.   
The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey 
Epstein's office.  Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we 
chatted very briefly.  I had my portfolio of photos, but he 
didn't even look at it.  Suddenly, he took his robe off and got 
close to me.  I got up to leave, but the door was locked.   
I didn't know what was going on.  It was my first 
official meeting to be cast in the United States.  I was a 
young girl and confused.  He got very close to me, and I had a 
skirt on.  He started to touch my genitals.  I refused him.  
Then he went to the massage table and showed me the vibrator.

I took it and threw it at him.   
At that point, I ran to the door again and figured out 
how to get out of there.  A girl outside asked me where I was 
going and she said to be careful.  She said that Mr. Epstein 
knew a lot of powerful people, including Bill Clinton, and that 
if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to 
have any job in the industry. 
I was so scared.  I couldn't wait to get out of there,
and I left.  I took the train home.  I had spent all of my
savings getting Victoria's Secret lingerie to prepare for what
I thought would be my audition.  But instead, it seemed like a
casting call for prostitution.  I felt like I was in hell.
Thank you, your Honor.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Allred.
Was there anybody else, any victim's counsel or any of 
the other victims who have not been heard and wish to be heard? 
Well, OK then.  All I have to say, really, is thank
you, all of you, for your participation in today's remarkable
hearing.  I think everybody has benefited greatly from your
input, and especially from the testimony of victims here today
and who have had the courage to come forward.
We have also benefited throughout these proceedings,
however brief altogether, from the attorneys' legal advocacy
and their written and oral submissions.  I'm grateful to them

as well, both for the government and the defense and those
representing the victims.
Finally, we're also grateful to the press for their
very diligent coverage of seemingly every detail of this case.
That concludes our work for today and we stand 
adjourned. 
Thanks.
