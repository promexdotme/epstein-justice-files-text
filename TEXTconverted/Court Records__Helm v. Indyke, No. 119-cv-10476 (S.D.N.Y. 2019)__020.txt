Re: 
Teresa Helm v. Darren K. lndyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the 
executors of The Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1 :19-cv-10476 (PGG) (DCF) 
Dear Judge Gardephe: 
We represent Darren K. lndyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, in the referenced action. We write with Plaintiffs consent to respectfully request a one 
business day extension of the briefing schedule for Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's 
Complaint, as follows: 
1. Defendant's motion is due on February 24, 2020 (currently February 21 ); 
2. Plaintiff's opposition is due on March 9, 2020 (currently March 6); and 
3. Defendant's reply, if any, is due on March 17 ( currently March 16). 
I requested this short extension because I was recently out of work for several days due to 
illness. This is the first request for an extension of these deadlines. The requested extension 
will not affect any other scheduled dates. 
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz 
Bennet J. Moskowitz 
MEMO ENDORSED 
the Application is granted.
