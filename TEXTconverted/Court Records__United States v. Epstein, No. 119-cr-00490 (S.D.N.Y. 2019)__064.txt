Re: 
United States v. Epstein, Case No. l 9-Cr-490 
Dear Judge Berman: 
On behalf of MSW Media, Inc, ("MSW Media"), I respectfully submit this letter motion 
to intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially 
opposing the Government's motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case, 
filed as Docket No. 61. 
MSW Media (https://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and biogs about 
federal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It 
clearly qualifies as a representative of the news media. 
MSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the following reason. On 17 July 
2025, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the 
Court's permission to release "any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of 
Information Act ("FOIA") request with the Department of Justice ("DOJ") for transcripts of all 
grand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-330 (S.D.N.Y.). We 
are concerned with the modifier "pertinent" in President Trump's instruction, and that concern 
seemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to "make 
appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information 
prior to releasing the transcripts." (Dkt. #61 at 2 ( emphasis added).) 
To be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not 
pertain to that information, However, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be 
implicitly seeking this Court's permission to withhold other personally identifiable information, 
such as information about the former defendant's partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while 
we join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make 
this narrow independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of 
withholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this 
FOIA request if necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 64     Filed 07/25/25     Page 4 of 4
withheld is a question best left to the court adjudicating that future case. We are concerned that, 
if this Court explicitly or implicitly blesses the Government's proposed redactions ofnon-victim-
related personally identifiable information ( even in passing), that opinion will be treated as a 
proverbial thumb on the scale in our FO IA case without materially affecting the Court's decision 
in this case. 
In other words, if this Court mentions in its decision that it was swayed at all by the 
Government's promise to redact personally identifiable information, we are concerned that the 
Government will then argue in its FOIA case that "Judge Berman agreed that this information 
should not be publicly disclosed." Therefore, we respectfully request that this Court not take the 
Government's statements regarding non-victim-related personally identifiable information into 
account when reaching its decision regarding the Government's motion, and we further request 
that the Court specify that it is not opining on that question, should it grant the Government's 
motion. 
The Government takes no position on the intervention of MSW Media. I did not consult 
with a representative for the former defendant.
