SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
 
 
-against- 
 
19 Cr. 830 (AT) 
ORDER 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, 
 
 
 
 
                                                 Defendants.   
ANALISA TORRES, District Judge: 
 
The Court has reviewed the parties’ letter dated April 15, 2021, setting forth their 
available dates for trial, ECF No. 50.  Due to conflicts in the Court’s and the parties’ availability 
in the third quarter of 2021, the Court, utilizing the procedures within this District governing the 
scheduling of jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, will instead seek to schedule a jury 
trial for the fourth calendar quarter of 2021.  By July 16, 2021, the parties shall submit blackout 
dates for trial.      
 
The time between June 14, 2021 and October 1, 2021 is excluded under the Speedy Trial 
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice.  The Court finds that the ends of 
justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the public and Defendants 
in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently administer the Court's 
docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties to prepare for trial and 
to discuss potential pretrial disposition. 
 
SO ORDERED.
