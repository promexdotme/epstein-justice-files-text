behind the vehicle, the vehicle left the safety zone which I then 
conducted a car stop on the 200 block of Bahama Lane. Upon

approaching the auto, I observed five occupants inside the car, 
several having bloodshot eyes. I also detected an odor of marijuana 
from inside the auto along with observing the occupants appeared very 
nervous. I first spoke with the operator of the vehicle, Benjamin 
Bryan and asked him if he had marijuana in his auto. Benjamin Bryan 
informed me that he did have marijuana, handing me a quantity of 
marijuana rolled in brown paper. I then asked the remainder of the 
occupants separately if they had marijuana and a female, identified as 
 informed me that she did have marijuana, handing me 
from her pocketbook a clear plastic bag containing a quantity of 
marijuana, a brown paper bag containing a quantity of marijuana and a 
glass pipe containing marijuana residue. A search of the vehicle 
incident to the lawful arrests, I recovered a glass pipe containing 
marijuana from under the front seat. Both individuals were charged 
with possession of marijuana under 20 grams and possession of drug 
paraphernalia and issued NTA's, returnable to Criminal Court, 3238 Gun 
Club Rd., on 9/27/05 at 0800 hours without incident. The marijuana 
possessed by Benjamin Bryan tested positive and weighed at 1.3 grams. 
The marijuana possessed by -- 	
tested positive and 3.0 
grams. All recovered items were placed into evidence. 
I also conducted an investigation on the remaining three 
individuals: David A. Cruz, dob/030987, William L. Tucker, dob/032887 
and Paul J. Abrams, dob/052386. Paul Abrams was found to be in 
possession of a suspended license, which I confiscated his license and 
issued him a criminal citation for such, returnable to the Criminal 
Justice Complex, 3228 Gun Club Rd., on 9/27/095 at 1330 hours.

rough times 
Current mood: sad 
Everything sucks right now. 
My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come 
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) 
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying 
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already 
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see 
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or 
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank 
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being 
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been 
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally 
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. 
There's been so much death around me. It's really 
overwhelming.

Freedom!!! 
Current mood: drained 
Hey, 
Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! 
For all of you who are not aware, I moved to 
Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will 
and I are getting along. Not like everyone 
predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of 
that time together will be horrible,...." the complete 
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get 
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" 
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. 
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a 
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an 
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a 
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores 
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I 
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. 
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I 
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it. 
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview 
the day he came in with the application, I think that's 
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right 
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a 
lir while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so 
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS 
job and the lady called me back and told me that 
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence 
that she didn't need to call anyone else back, 	
he 
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound 
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the old 
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No 
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke 
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply 
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back 
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

Biker Bitch 
Current mood: Q exhausted 
Category: Automotive 
I am s00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys 
For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I 
went with him. It was s00000000000 cool! There was 
400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this 
guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to 
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I 
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He 
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote 
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into 
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and 
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
W 111111111111111111111111 I donated a football and a 
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so 
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. 
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. 
Bye!

Current mood: Q crushed 
Category: School, College, Greek 
I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for 
on Jan. 5. I'm 
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making 
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so 
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't 
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I 
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to 
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u 
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal 
with it.

Current mood: 	
pissed off 
I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at 
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me 
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the 
way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on 
EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I 
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and 
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I 
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much 
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more 
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is 
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!!!!!!

hey, 
halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up 
going to a party. our makeup was awesome. i only 
have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have 
more. the one i have up is of us after the make-up 
had been on for hours, 	
it started to peel off in the 
pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found 
a red pitbull puppy a few days ago. i wrote a bulletin 
about her but i forgot to add that she is s000000 
good with children. i have an 18 month old living 
with me and she is just s0000 
nice 
to him. she loves 
to play with him and has not shown one sign of 
agression. even with another dog that is bigger than 
her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i 
want to keep her s0000 bad, i just can't tho. 
someone please take hermitr and provide her with a 
good homellill thank u. <3.

Greetings from Tallahassee 
Current mood: 0 peaceful 
I made it! I'm at 
I love it here. My dorm is so 
big and nice, compared to most of the other dorms 
on campus. I've been going to class now for three 
weeks and I love it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing 
quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in 
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in 
love with 
The weather, most of the time is 
perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is 
visiting and I am so excited. I'm goinna show him all 
over. We're going to have the best time! Hopefully, 
everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this 
pace I'll have a descent chance at the dean's list. 
OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss 
everyone! XOXO

Current mood: Q exhausted 
Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes 
So, I am officially a "college gal." The past two days 
have been incredibly stressful. I've been so busy; all 
I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm 
yesterday but I still have alot of stuff to buy to make 
it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is awesome. 
There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky 
enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal 
with and the room is a decent size so I can have 
privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, 
however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going 
on, 	
 I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who 
knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not used to falling asleep by 
myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked 
women on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not,

but atleast it feels like it right now. I don't know how 
I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. 
Anyway, I finished orientation today. It was s00000 
boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all 
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when 
registration opens and go on the computer and finish 
applying for classes because for some reason that 
shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My 
INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it 
this morning at 3am because I had to register today 
and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last 
minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME 
	
 I CAN'T 
WAITIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Hold On: Let me say that 
again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY 
WEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also want to get a 
vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because 
apparently there are 'narcs' everywhere. Well, I'm 
really excited about starting class and meeting 
people. If you've read to this point then I feel bad for 
you. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up, 	
 
hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry 
to those of you I promised to hang out with but 
couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so 
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch 
to all of those who know me. Wish me luck!

guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to 
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I 
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He 
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote 
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into 
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and 
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a 
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so 
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. 
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to.

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for 
on Jan. 5. I'm 
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making 
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so 
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't 
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I 
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to 
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u 
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal 
with it.

I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at 
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me 
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the 
way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on 
EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I 
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and 
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I 
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much 
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more 
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is 
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!  HH!

I made it! I'm at 
I love it here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of 
the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love 
it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in 
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with 
The weather, 
most of the time is perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I 
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over. We're going to have the best time! 
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a 
descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss 
everyone! XOXO

awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only 
have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy 
too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's 
going on, 	
 I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not 
used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women 
on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I 
don't know how I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished 
orientation today. It was s00000 boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all 
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the 
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be 
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it 
this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted 
to do. I'm so last minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME 
N'EEDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII  I CAN'TWAITIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII (Hold On: Let me say 
that again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY WEEDIIII III I I I II II I I I II II I I II l  I also want to get a 
vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs' 
everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If 
you've read to this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this 
thing up, 	
 I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you 
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so 
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me. 
Wish me luck!

I am s00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My 
neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was s00000000000 cool! There was 400 
bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes 
all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and 
went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to 
promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing 
there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
itiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had 
two toys In It so It was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to

on Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room 
soon and It's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not 
having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem 
like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through 
this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 
different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it.

Current mood: C) pissed off 
I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret. They said they 
suspected me of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the way is bullshit! I 
was 'by the book' on EVERYTHINGllIllIl I got so fed up in that office that I handed 
the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE 
MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$$. 
I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately 
the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLESIIIIII

Current mood: 0 content 
hey, 
halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up going to a party. our makeup was 
awesome. i only have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have more. the one i 
have up is of us after the make-up had been on for hours, 	
it started to peel off in 
the pic but i think it still looks awesome, also, we found a red pitbull puppy a few 
days ago. i wrote a bulletin about her but i forgot to add that she is s000000 good 
with children. i have an 18 month old living with me and she is just s0000 nice to 
him. she loves to play with him and has not shown one sign of agression. even with 
another dog that is bigger than her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i 
want to keep her s0000 bad, i just can't tho. someone please take her!!!!!! and 
provide her with a good home!!!!! thank u. <3

I think that Jeffrey Epstein's

Beach 
in this county ("Palm 
Beach chief focus of fire in 
Epstein case," Aug. 14). 
The exception: the Rush Lim-
baugh case. But that was at a 
time when Palm Beach County 
State Attorney Barry Krischer 
was running for reelection 
and was not sure he would 
run uncontested. He received 
thousands of e-mails asking 
him to press charges against 
Mr. Limbaugh. It was a good 
political move to do so. 
The Epstein camp should 
stop attacking the victims' 
reputation in the media. Let's 
not forget — they are children. 
A child's reputation is sacred. 
 
Also, according to the law, lack 
of knowledge of the age of the 
victim is no defense for statu- - 
tory rape or any sexual crime 
committed against a child. 
If his camp feels that Jeffrey 
Epstein has been libeled, his 
high-powered attorneys. Jack 
Goldberger and Alan Dershow-
ita can file a libel suit against 
the appropriate parties. Accord-
ing to the law, the truth is an 
absolute defense against libel 
Other than that, the Epstein 
camp should be silent and con-
tent with the justice obtained 
from the state attorney. Past 
cases indicate that children's 
rights, victim's rights and 
women's rights are meaningless, 
and often the victim is re-vic-
timized.

Regardless of whatever

We soon will find out whether 
big money can buy from the crimi-
nal justice system what everyone 
assumes that big money can buy. 
The penalty news reports say 
part-time Palm Beach resident 
Jeffrey Epstein is expected to face 
suggests that he will plead guilty 
to something more than one felony 
count for solicitation of prostitution. 
A Palm Beach County grand jury 
indicted the Manhattan money 
manager on that charge in July 
2006. But a guilty plea that does not 
recognize the age of the girls whom 
police say the billionaire paid for 
sex would be a disservice to the 
girls, an insult to the investigators 
who pressed the case and, for good 
measure, a general outrage. 
Palm Beach police have said that 
Jeffrey Epstein, 54., paid underage 
girls, one as young as 14, to come to 
his 7.200-square-foot waterfront. home 
for "massage" sessions. Police said 
interviews with five alleged victims 
and 17 witnesses under oath, phone 
messages, a high school transcript 
and other items they found in MI: 
Epstein's trash and• home show that 
he knew how young the girls were. 
But after Mr. EpstenA attorneys told 
prosecutors about the girls' MySpace 
pages, which mentioned marijuana 
and alcohol use, State Attorney Barry 
Krischer sent the case to s grand jury, 
instead of filing charges himself. 
Blaming these victims. however, 
does not make them any more de-
serving of what happened. And Mr. 
Krischer's unnecessary handoff to a 
grand jury, after an 11-month police 
investigation. more than reinforced 
Jeffrey Epstein case 
corms to turning point. 
the public understanding tha.i 
the more money the accused hits. 
the bigger the break he gels. Mr 
I 
Epstein's legal team includes Wes . 
 
Palm Beach defense attorney lad: 
Goldberger, Harvard Law School 
Professor Alan Dershowitz. who 
worked oil the 0.1. Simpton murder 
case, and Kenneth Starr, who once 
pursued a president based on hi; 
lies about sex with young women. 
Federal authorities also stepped 
in, which stalled the state's case 
for anothor year. On Nov. 9, citing 
an unnamed source close to Jeffrey 
Epstein, ,lose Lambiet of The Its! 
wrote that the federal investigation 
is over, and Mr. Epstein is expected 
to serve up to 18 months and mulct 
be labele4 a sex offender in C1' 
nal recorils. The charge the grand 
jury returned more than a year age 
carries a maximum five-year prise]) 
term and no "sex offender" label. 
"This case," Mr. Goldberger tout 
Mr. LanNet, "is absolutely going 
end without a trial within the next 
 
two months." State attorney spoket--
man Michael Edmondson woe to 
not confirm any plea deal. But. 
noted: '1 he state attorney's hand 
are not tied by there being a single 
grand 'cry charge. That does net 
preclude additional charges." 
Jeffrey Epstein, like too many 
men in Florida, preyed on teenaged 
girls. Tito system should not let him 
buy hii-INvav out of that reality

We soon will find out whether 
big money can buy from the crimi-
nal justice system what everyone 
assumes that:big money can buy. 
'The penalty news reports say 
part-time Palm Beach resident 
Jeffrey Epstein is expected to face 
suggests that he will plead guilty 
to something more than one felony 
count for solicitation of prostitution. 
A Palm Beach County grand jury-
indicted the Manhattan money 
manager on that charge in July 
2006. But a guilty plea that does not

Police say the billionaire paid for 
sex would be a disservice to the 
girls, an insult to the investigators 
who pressed the case and, for good 
measure, a general outrage. 
Palm Beach police have said that 
Jeffrey Epstein, 54, paid underage 
girls, one as young as 14, to come to 
his 7.200-square-foot waterfront home 
for "massage" sessions. Police said 
interviews with five alleged victims 
and 17 witnesses under oath, phone 
messages, a high school transcript 
and other items they found in Mt 
Epstein's trash and home show that 
he knew how young the girls were. 
But after Mr. Epstein's attorneys told 
prosecutors about the girls' MySpace 
pages, which mentioned marijuana 
and alcohol use, State Attorney Barry 
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury, 
instead of filinv charges himself. 
Blaming these victims, however, 
does not make them any more de-
serving of what happened. And Mr. 
Krischer's unnecessary handoff to a 
grand jury, after an 11-month police 
investigation, more than reinforced 
Jeffrey Epstein case 
comes to turning point.

Federal authorities also stepped

"This case," Mr. Goldberger tote 
Mr. Lamhiet, "is absolutely going ts

man Michael Edmondson won if:

noted: 'I he state attorney's hand ::

Accused of paying underage girls for sex, superrich money manager Jeffrey Epstein is 
finding that living in a dream world is dangerous—even if you can pay for it. 
• By Philip Weiss 
• Published Dec 10. 2007 
Cori.. 
Jeffrey Epstein is under indictment for sex crimes in Palm Beach, Florida, and I'd expected that when he 
came into the office of PR guru Howard Rubenstein, he would be sober and reserved. Quite the 
opposite. He was sparkling and ingenuous, apologizing for the half-hour lateness with a charming line—
"I never realized how many one-way streets and no-right-turns there are in midtown. I finally got out 
and walked"—and as we went down the corridor to Rubenstein's office, he asked, "Have you managed 
to talk to many of my friends?" Epstein had been supplying me the phone numbers of important 
scientists and financiers and media figures. "Do you understand what an extraordinary group of people

they are, what they have accomplished in their fields?" 
One of the accusers—a girl of 14—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why. His 
walk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened 
qualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on 
his signature outfit: new blue jeans and a powder-blue sweater. "I've only ever seen him in jeans," his 
friend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein's 
signal that he doesn't have to wear a uniform like the rest of us. 
1 told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic 
delight in every word. "A secretive genius," I'd said. "Not secretive, private," he corrected in his warm 
Brooklyn accent. "And if I was a genius I wouldn't be sitting here.-  "A guy with sex issues." A smile 
formed on Epstein's bow-shaped lips. "What do you mean by sex issues?" Well ... He was 54, had 
never married—I didn't finish. "Are you channeling my mother?" 
When I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in 
capital letters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein's soul. "It's the Icarus story, 
someone who flies too close to the sun," I said. "Did Icarus like massages?" Epstein asked. 
Two years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they 
came into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and 
soaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his attorney. 
"Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound 
for him: that is why he has had many massages." Epstein had even given $100,000 to Ballet Florida's 
massage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated. 
I never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lcfcourt was 
negotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that 
Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there's 
likely to be a shameful admission. He has always had thc confidence that comes with the power to 
dazzle and, though accused of "doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah," as one friend put it. seemed 
to believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn't the least bit tawdry. 
-T-Ic lives in a different environment," says Siegal. "He's of this world. But he creates this different 
environment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent townhouse I've ever been in, and I've been in 
everything. I've seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the 
Caribbean—it is not to be believed. I've seen photographs of thc apartment Ln Paris ... How did he get 
himself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He's very mysterious. Not that many 
people get close to him. Not that many people know him."

of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein's rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house; 
Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein's forte was dealing with wealthier 
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly 
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no 
footman; he loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who 
could show the rich how to live with their money. "I want people to understand the power, the 
responsibility, and the burden of their money," he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. "I 
think it's all done with mirrors," says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and 
lost) when an oil deal didn't work out. 
Next: Epstein's Icarus moment. 
Redux) 
Stroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. "Everybody who's his friend thinks he's so 
darn brilliant because he's so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, I never saw him work. Anybody I 
know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day." 
Those who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. "His mind 
goes through a cross section of descriptions," says Joe Pagano, a financier. "He can go from 
mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct 
answer in the shortest period of time. That's my definition of IQ." 
A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. "He has the ability to 
make connections that other minds can't make," says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. "He is 
extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also 
to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an 
extremely short attention span. Why?—it's not that he's bored He has enough information after fifteen

minutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert's 
statements." 
Epstein has been a munificent supporter of cutting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early 
biotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the 
late nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference 
on the West Coast in his beautiful 727. 
"It was all a little giddy," Wolff says. "There's a little food out, lovely hors d'oeuvre. And then after 
fifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he 
had a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual attire. Jeans, no socks, 
loafers, a button-down shirt, shirttails out. And he was followed onto the plane by—how shall I say 
this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, 18, 19, 20, who 
knows? They were model-like. They towered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things. 
You didn't know what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very 
tall girls?" 
Soon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on Fast 71st Street. He understood that there was a 
purpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Ober-way. "What does the 
media mean, where does he fit into it?" Then Epstein began to show up in the press. In 2002, he flew 
Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being 
written about. In 2003, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was 
involved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his 
office at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. "His 
literal office is where Bennett Cerf's was. It's an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at 
all. It's almost European. It's old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way." Nearby, Wolff went on, "the 
trading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They're like a throwback, a 
bunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and 
a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say 'What's 
going on here?' and he gives you that Cheshire smile." 
Epstein likes to say he's private, but you don't fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting attention. One 
friend says the Africa trip was Epstein's Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural 
forces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends' theory 
of the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief battened onto a rich man because he was not living 
in a box like everyone else. 
The dazzling arc of Epstein's comet came to an end—without his knowing it—in March 2005. That was 
when a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name, 
said that she believed her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The 
stepmother had learned about the matter in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an 
"involuntary-admitted juvenile educational facility" because of behavior problems. She had shown up at 
the school with $300 in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a 
"whore," another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school_ The stepmother got a 
call from another student's mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present. 
The girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic 
Intracoastal Waterway. and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of 
25 who wasn't very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in, 
naked but for a towel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he 
touched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.

Next: The police lock onto Epstein's sybaritic lifestyle. 
The lengthy police narrative in the case doesn't make clear how police connected gray-haired Jeff with 
Jeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw 
themselves into an investigation of the modem and palatial house on El Brillo Way. 
Palm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for towering ficus privacy hedges on 
Mediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the 
police did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach, 
where, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein's house. The 14-
year-old was used to set up her I 8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once 
and thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $200 a head. "I'm like Heidi Fleiss," she said. 
The police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer 
parks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls, 
who said they could make $200 by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her 
the younger the better—which she said meant 18 to 20. The rules were simple. Tell him you're 18. 
There might be some touching; you could draw the line. "The more you do, the more you are paid." A 
couple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 50 times, 
another hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-19-year-old 
beauty who Epstein told one of them was his "sex slave"; he'd purchased her from her family back in 
Yugoslavia. 
Epstein's friends' belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto 
Epstein's sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls' thong panties, the shape and color of 
the sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the 
statue of the man with a bow. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an 
eye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner's plane, noting the procession of Cadillac 
Escalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein, 
through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York 
decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized 
a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-
shaped soaps. 
Those soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn't see his sex life as tawdry, wasn't 
hiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from "a deep and 
basic cultural moment" once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. "Jeffrey is living a life that once might have 
been prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgrown it. 
You can't describe it without being held to severe account. It's not allowed. It may be allowed if you're 
secretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an 
achievement to Jeffrey." 
Some girls who "worked" for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who 
allegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was "so in love 
with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him." Two college girls/aspiring models were matter-of-
fact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house. 
But generally the girls' feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein

very uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over." Another kept looking at the clock,

didn't like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn't want it inside them. Some couldn't say just what

Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they 
talked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was "powerful" and was 
afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in 
which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to 
model the underwear he'd bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was 
so upset by Epstein's removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship 
with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein "a pervert." 
Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly 
and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom 
was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with 
sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein's love shack was like 
Hugh Heftier's. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge porn is 
men with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-school cheerleaders or college girls on break, 
and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52, 
Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and 
Coeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that 
his activities would result in a police investigation. 
His claim that he'd given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. "The 
massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It's part of a dancer's life to have daily 
massages," says the ballet's marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein's generosities 
preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue 
masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy 
endings, 
Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation. 
The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The 
law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein's girls 
might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it's difficult to believe Epstein 
wouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying 
that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered 
whatever they wanted from Epstein's chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told 
police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could 
happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss's direction, he brought a pail of 
roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama. 
"He has never been secretive about the girls," Wolff says. "At one point, when his troubles began, he 
was talking to me and said, 'What can I say, I like young girls.' I said, 'Maybe you should say, 'I like 
young women.' " 
Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein's friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law 
professor, provided the police and the state attorney's office with a dossier on a couple of the victims 
gleaned from their MySpace sites—showing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police 
complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to 
appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say, 
"Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with." 
By then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the

waterway to the Palm Beach County state attorney's office, but the state attorney apparently saw the 
main witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on 
MySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria's Secret. The police wanted numerous 
felony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they 
heard that the state attorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and 
sending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state attorney of 
bending over backward for a rich man and then turned the matter over to the FBI. 
Finally, in July 2006, the Palm Beach County state attorney's office handed down one indictment of 
Epstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment. 
Reiter was enraged. He released a letter he had sent out to five underage girls that read "I do not feel that 
justice has been sufficiently served." 
Epstein's lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S. 
Attorney's office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member. Kenneth Starr, the 
former Clinton prosecutor. 
One of Epstein's friends told me, "He thinks there's an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm 
Beach. He's convinced of that. Maybe it's a defense mechanism." Palm Beach was historically a bastion 
of Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the 
public fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems 
stuck in the time of the Gentlemen's Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I 
asked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple 
Entanu-E1 (circa the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modem Dreyfus. "There's no way, 
shape. or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes. 
And there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew." Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues 
from opening. There are now four on the little island, including an Orthodox shut started by Slim-Fast 
founder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, "Half r4y

Maybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein's two big 	
at 
charitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershowitz and Rubenstein are also major/. 
Israel supporters. Dershowitz has written a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Now throw .1

Of course, that might be evidence_ But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from je 401  ) 11\ 
Edgar Allan Poe's psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth's sociological comedies. Epstein is 
licensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shower on the first floor was 
given over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had 
a Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Now he was licensed 
in the Virgin Islands and gave his -permanent residence" as the same address as Island Yachts. 
Notwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and 
joyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the 
sensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna

Next. Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong. 
The police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had 
had a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the 
daughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died 
mysteriously off his yacht in 1991. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father 
and that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas 
says he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house, 
and the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was 
five years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never showed up in all the surveillance, 
only her stationery. 
Epstein's activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told 
police that toward the end of his employment, the girls were "younger and younger," and he often had to 
wash off vibrators and "a long rubber penis" left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, 
said that he found the sex toys he had to wash "scattered on the floor." oa  
No need to worry about dirty laundry, if there's someone to do it.

The U.S. attorney's investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would 
be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein 
will not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state attorney on the prostitution charge. 
Not that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the 
air that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endowed him with utter 
shamelessness, the emperor's new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the 
moral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the 
social contract was not made in good faith. Epstein's friends say that on this matter, he has a 
philosophical position. 
"Fundamentally," Wolff says, "it's about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich 
get richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey's point is that this 
whole issue is-it's just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more 
successful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater 
the discrepancy actually is." 
There is no better place to observe how Epstein's mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of 
life are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from 
Bulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls 
came from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters, 
and pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson's house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch. 
An attractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams 
it. "We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case." 
Driving home with their $500, Haley said to the 14-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd 
be rich. and it's understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest 
stories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman's wife, 
said she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation 
with him. He made it clear that he did "not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm 
Beach.-  One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.

"In my mind, I'm like, 'Oh my God, when this is over you're getting so much money." 
Jose Lambiet says the case went forward in Palm Beach despite the efforts of the dream team because of 
community rage arising from the class issues in the case—Epstein found the girls not from his own 
fancy neighborhood but from the struggling suburbs. 
He has never shown a glimmer of understanding that a high-school girl could be damaged by a powerful 
50-year-old's demands, or that some of the girls were already emotionally damaged. For someone who 
could dream anything, it seems a little small.
