anybody left with you and Haley said yes and then she said are you bringing 
them to the guy's house? In Gardens or wherever he lives. And she said I don't

to this guy's house so that, so that, she was gonna get paid, like I don't know 
how much money but this man's been paying money. And that she was gonna 
bring me along and then Zack was like no, you're not taking her and then she's 
like well, I'll ask her and then she just told me, she didn't tell me what's she's 
gonna do, she told me she's going to some old guy's house and (inaudible) get 
my shoes and go shopping. So I was like, okay. And then we went, I don't know 
what day it was cause she picked me up. I'm pretty sure it was a Saturday or a 
Sunday. So she picked me up and we get in the car and she (inaudible) and 
then we left and we were still driving and then we went to his house and we were 
waiting in the kitchen and the old man came and he's like, hello, l'm ... l don't

were like brand new because they only had like one crease in them and that's 
when they're folded in half. • And he said thank you for your time. And then he 
left. And he said you can see your way out and I was just walking and I got lost

guess because I was done. And then, then we left the same way we came in 
and then Haley's like oh my gosh, Haley goes how did you like it. Like how much 
did he give you, how much did he pay you. And I'm like $300. And I was kind of 
like $300, Haley. Cause the girl was like this. She was looking at me really weird.

outside and the dog was way in towards my dad's truck, like my dad thought he 
was attacking the animals but my dad, a person, a boy, I don't know for a fact

won't do it again. And like she just kind of like hung up and he was like I hate 
her, I hate her and then I hate you too. And I was like okay and we broke up and 
then I think (inaudible) on the computer and I think he told Sheena what 
happened and she turned it into an extraordinary, like story so at school so I 
would look like, you know, like I'm the bad person, like I'm a slut, I'm a whore or 
something and she's going around school saying all this stuff and then so my 
parents came, cause that's when I got mad at her and told her to stop talking but 
she wouldn't stop talking about it. So I just got in a fight with her, like a fist fight 
at school. And I got suspended and so did she but she only got suspended for 
one day because I started the fight. So I got in trouble more. And my dad got 
really mad and he grounded me for it, because he found the $300 in my wallet 
and then my dad was like, you're grounded, you're grounded forever and he's all 
freaking out, how could you do this, blah, blah. The school said you did. And 
um, I didn't tell the school how, I told them I got it from my job, cause I worked at 
Chick Filet but I quit. So I said I (inaudible) but nobody believed me so I was just

though you went there willingly. Even though you went there willingly, you were 
still taken advantage of. Okay? Because you were put into a position that you 
felt you had no choice. Once you were there, before when you were telling me 
about how Jeff told you to take off your clothes? You took your pointer and you 
said he was really stern and you banged your leg, you put the pointer on your leg 
when you said that. How did you feel when he told you to take your clothes off?

like, you know, like, pushing my legs on the table so like I could kind of sit up and 
he was like could you please just put all...like sit on me, put all your body weight 
on me. And then I went, I was just kind of like kind of think I did when I was 
actually sitting on him, I didn't realize what it was and then like, I got grossed out 
and as I'm going down, kind of like popped up again. Cause it was gross.

9 
touching me?

1 O 
MP:

11 
12 
And I'm over here. And l"m still giving you a massage and everything but this

1 
MP: 
Okay. After everything was done, okay, did he watch you get dressed? 
2 
-
No. Cause I was getting dressed while he was out there getting the $300. 
3 
4 
guess that's what he was doing. That's the only thing he came back in with. He 
was still in a towel and stuff. 
5 
MP: 
In the room, at all, do you think ... and I don't know if there is or not, but do you 
6 
think there is anything in there that may have recorded what you did? 
7 
• 
Oh my gosh .... 
8 
MP: 
A video camera ... 
9 
-
Oh my gosh. I didn't think about that. There was lots of places there could have 
10 
been one because there's pictures, that could have been, I don't know .... 
11 
MP: 
When he walked out. .. the reason why I ask is because he walked out once and 
12 
13 
then came back in, right? 
Yes. 
14 
MP: 
So it could be just so he could whack off. I was just curious. I don't know if 
15 
16 
there is or not. 
If there was, I did not know about it. 
17 
MP: 
Okay. So you get dressed, you go downstairs. Where is that woman again? 
18 
-
Downstairs talking to Haley and the other girl. 
19 
MP: 
Okay. 
20 
-
They were having a conversation. 
21 
MP: 
Okay. At any time, did he speak to you or does he know how old you are, did he 
22 
23 
know how old you were? 
Okay. Yes. And, as a matter of fact, Haley told me to say I was 18, because

Haley said tell him you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house. 
So I said he was 18. As I was giving him a massage, he was like how old are 
you. And then I was 18. But I kind of said it really fast because I didn't want to 
make it sound like I was lying or anything. 
5 
MP: 
So what other things did he ask you? 
6 
-
Um, how I know Haley, what school I went to. 
7 
MP: 
Did you tell him what school you went to? 
8 
-
Yeah but I told him Wellington. I didn't tell him Royal Palm. 
9 
MP: 
Did he ask you what grade you were in or did you tell him what grade you were 
10 
in? 
11 
-
Yeah, he was like what grade are you in? Because I told him I was in 12th grade 
12 
still. 
13 
MP: 
Okay. 
14 
-
Because I told him I was 18 so I had to ... 
15 
MP: 
So you told him you were in 12th grade? 
16 
-
Yes. 
17 
MP: 
Are you sure? 
18 
-
Yes. 
19 
MP: 
Okay. What else did you talk about? 
20 
• 
Um, that's about it. And he-was kind of asking me like how I knew Haley, is 
21 
22 
23 
Haley nice to me and then he told me how he knew Haley and he was like, I was 
kind of like, how do you know Haley. Cause I brought up the conversation. He 
said well I know Haley because she's been working for me for a long time. And 
Page 39 of 43 

07/26/17

2 
then like, I kind of, you kind of get the picture, working for you and hello, I'm 
sitting there giving him a back massage. So I kind of figured it out. 
3 
MP: 
He never said that, he just... 
4 
-
Yes .. 
5 
MP: 
... said that she worked for him. 
6 
• 
Yeah but don't...on our way back home, that, like, doesn't make any sense if she 
7 
8 
didn't do that because why would Haley be doing (inaudible) for almost the same 
amount of money as me. 
9 
MP: 
Right. Well, why couldn't he pay her that day? 
10 
-
I don't know, because that's a good question. Cause she didn't, as far as I know, 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
but I don't know but I'm pretty sure she didn't tell me, she didn't think. She was 
just downstairs having a conversation. And I think that when I went up to the 
lady, he paid her because like, you know, so because, he paid her while I went 
upstairs and when I went downstairs, she was still talking to the lady still and she 
goes, when we were in the kitchen waiting, the old man to come to the house 
still, she said, oh the chef is so hot, he works here and she was like, and she's 
like he's so hot, you know, saying his face and then the other girl (inaudible) 
because when we saw the chef come in, he was old, too. He was like ... 
19 
MP: 
So Haley likes older guys. 
20 
-
Must like it. 
21 
MP: 
Okay. So you left and that was the last time you see him. 
22 
1111 Yes and that's the last time I went. ... 
23 
MP: 
Has Jeff ever tried to call you?

1 
Nope. And ... 
2 
MP: 
Did you leave a phone number? 
3 
-
Yeah. Actually I did. Cause when I was leaving, he goes um, please leave your 
4 
5 
6 
phone number so Haley can keep in touch with you because she doesn't have 
your phone number. So I didn't, I just gave him my cell phone number. I didn't 
give him my house number, I gave him my cell phone number. 
7 
MP: 
And how long ago was this? 
8 
-
Oh my gosh, I couldn't tell you the date but.. .. it was about maybe, oh my gosh, a 
9 
month and a half ago. I don't really know .. 
10 
MP: 
In February? 
11 
-1. 
.. 
12 
MP: 
Because we're in March right now. 
13 
-
Either the very beginning of February or the end of January. I couldn't tell you ... 
14 
MP: 
How long after did you get into that fight with Sheena? 
15 
■ Um, like a week, cause ... 
16 
MP: 
You got into a fight with Sheena on the 9th. 
17 
■ Okay, so yes, it was about a week after .... or before. 
18 
MP: 
Okay. And who else besides Zack did you tell what happened? 
19 
-
That's it. 
20 
MP: 
Besides Haley of course. 
21 
• 
Zack and Haley. 
22 
MP: 
Do you think Haley has brought anybody else that you know of? 
23 
No, but she wanted me to bring my sister but that same day was going to her

4 
I swear to God. 
5 
MP: 
Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk to me about? 
6 
No, because that's about.. .. nothing else about the whole thing. 
7 
MP: 
So that's it. You did not have any kind of sex with him. 
8 
1111 
Heck no!! I will swear on my mother's grave ... 
9 
MP: 
You know what having sex with somebody means? 
10 
■ 
Yes, I know what having sex with somebody means. 
11 
MP: 
Okay. You, at no time, touched his penis? 
12 -
At no time did I touch his penis. 
13 
MP: 
At any time, did he touch you ..... 
14 • 
At no time ... 
15 
MP: 
Besides putting his hands ... 
16 
Besides that, no times did he touch me. 
17 
MP: 
And just so I can be sure, you saw him whacking off once. 
18 -
Yes, I saw him. 
19 
MP: 
Okay. And as far as you think ..... 
20 -
I think, I know, well, I couldn't say I know, but it's the same noises were being 
21 
made when he was (inaudible). 
22 
MP: 
And that's it. I thank you very much. This will conclude the interview. The time
