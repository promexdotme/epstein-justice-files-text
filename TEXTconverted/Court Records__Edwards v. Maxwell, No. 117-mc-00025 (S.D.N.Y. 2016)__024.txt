In re: SUBPOENA TO BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS  
 
Underlying case: 
 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, Plaintiff 
 
v. 
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, Defendant 
 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.) 
 
 
 
NOTICE OF STATUS OF SUBPOENA 
DUCES TECUM AND RELATED 
RULINGS IN UNDERLYING ACTION 
 
 
Case Number 0:16-mc-61262-JG 
 
 
 
 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this notice of her position respecting 
the Subpoena Duces Tecum to Bradly Edwards and a Related Ruling in the underlying Action, 
and the Status of outstanding Requests for Production and the Motion to Quash, stating as 
follows: 
 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 24     Filed 12/16/16     Page 1 of 5

1. The Court should be advised that in addition to the Subpoena Duces Tecum served on 
Bradly Edwards (“Mr. Edwards”) which is the subject of the pending Motion to Quash, 
Ms. Maxwell served a similar, although not identical, Subpoena Duces Tecum on one of 
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre other attorneys, Paul Cassell (the “Cassell Subpoena”), Ex. A. 
2. Mr. Cassell, like Mr. Edwards, moved to quash.  The District Court for the District of 
Utah transferred the Motion to Quash to the Southern District of New York where the 
underlying action is pending.   
3. The Court presiding over the underlying action in the Southern District of New York 
issued a ruling on the Cassell Motion to Quash on August 30, 2016, attached hereto as 
Ex. B. 
4. Certain of the requests for production in the Cassell Subpoena are identical to the Request 
for Production to Mr. Edwards, which is subject to the Motion to Quash in the matter.  It 
is Ms. Maxwell’s position that the rulings made by the Court in the Southern District of 
New York are res judicata on the Edwards Subpoena with respect to the identical 
requests in the Cassell Subpoena, and binding Mr. Edwards and Ms. Maxwell.  For the 
Court’s convenience, the following is a table of the questions that are identical as 
between the Edwards Subpoena and the Cassell Subpoena, and the Court’s ruling on each 
in the Southern District of New York.

5. Based on the forgoing, Ms. Maxwell believes that the Court Should issue an Order 
consistent with the binding determinations of the Court in which the underlying case is 
pending on identical issues. 
a. Denying the Motion to Quash Request Numbers 1, 2, 10 and 11 and require 
Production of documents within 14 days of the Order1; 
b. Granting Motion to Quash 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 15; and 
c. Requiring Production of the Non-Contested Requests for production, Request 
Numbers 14, 16, 17 and 18 within 14 days of the Order. 
 
6. The case remains active and is scheduled for trial in March 2017.  Ms. Maxwell requests 
that the Court deny the Motion to Quash on the remaining outstanding Requests for 
Production, Requests 3, 4, 5, 12, 19 and 20 for the reasons set forth in the Response to the 
Motion to Quash.  
 
                                                 
1 Ms. Maxwell does not seek a second production of documents that have already been produced in this 
matter, including those already produced third parties Mr. Cassell or Victims Refuse Silence.
