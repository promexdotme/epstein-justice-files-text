JANE DOE NO. 1, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY

Defendants. 
I 
MOTION TO DISMISS 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure and Rule 7.l(A) of the Local Rules for the Southern District of 
Florida, moves to dismiss Counts I, II and IV of plaintiffs amended complaint1 
against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, and states as follows: 
1 The time to answer the remaining allegations of the amended complaint is tolled pending the 
Court's ruling on the present motion. See Beaulieu v. Ed. of Trustees of Univ. of W Fla., No. 
3:07cv30/RV/EMT, 2007 WL 2020161, * 2 (N.D. Fla. July 9, 2007) (holding that defendant's 
partial motion to dismiss "automatically extends its time to answer ... until after the court has 
ruled on [its] motion to dismiss"); Finnegan v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., 180 F.R.D. 247, 
249 (W.D.N.Y. 1998) (concluding "that the filing of a motion that only addresses part of a 
complaint suspends the time to respond to the entire complaint, not just to the claims that are the 
subject of the motion"); Schwartz v. Berry College, Inc., No. Civ.A. 4:96CV338-HLM, 1997 WL 
579166, *l (N.D. Ga. July 3, 1997) (noting that there is significant case law to support the 
position that "when a defendant files a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss, addressing only some of

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
ALLEGATIONS IN PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT 
This action arises out of the alleged assault of the plaintiff. According to the 
allegations in her amended complaint, the plaintiff went to Mr. Epstein's house to 
give him "a massage for monetary compensation" (Am. Compl. ,r 13), where Mr. 
Epstein allegedly assaulted her "in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida 
Statutes."2 (Am. Compl. ,r 18). To sharpen her lawsuit, the plaintiff says she is 
seeking damages in connection with a "conspiracy" (Am. Compl. ,r 22), a "plan" 
(Am. Compl. ,r 32), a "scheme" (Am. Compl. ,r 32) and an "enterprise" (Am. 
Compl. ,r 32) and adds two nominal defendants. 
The plaintiff tries to assert claims for sexual assault (Am. Comp 1. ,r,r 16-19), 
civil conspiracy (Am. Compl. ,r,r 20-23) and civil RICO (Am. Compl. ,r,r 29-34). 
These theories of liability, however, cannot be supported by the allegations in the 
amended complaint. In fact, even if everything in the amended complaint were 
true, recovery against Jeffrey Epstein, for Counts I, II and IV, under any 
formulation, is impossible under Florida law. Accordingly, these counts must be 
dismissed. 
the claims contained in the plaintiffs complaint, the defendant is not required to file an answer 
until the comi rules on the motion to dismiss"). 
2 Notably, on February 20, 2008, the plaintiff was deposed in State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 
502006CF009454AXXXMB (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct., filed Jul. 19, 2006). During that deposition, she 
made numerous admissions that completely undermine the allegations that she has pled in her 
complaint against Mr. Epstein. Regardless, for the procedural purposes of this motion only, we 
take her allegations as true.

ARGUMENT 
A motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) should be granted when a 
court cannot identify "each of the material elements necessary to sustain a 
recovery under some viable legal theory." Snow v. DirectTV, Inc., 450 F.3d 1314, 
1320 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. For Choice, Inc., 253 
F.3d 678, 684 (11th Cir. 2001)). Moreover, a court should dismiss a complaint 
"when, on the basis of a dispositive issue of law, no construction of the factual 
allegations will support a cause of action." Marshall County Bd. of Educ. v. 
Marshal County Gas Dist., 992 F.2d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 1993). "[T]o survive a 
motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must do more than merely state legal conclusions; 
they are required to allege some specific factual bases for those conclusions .... " 
Holt v. Crist, No. 06-14617, 2007 WL 1156938, *2 (11th Cir. Apr. 19, 2007). As 
such, "conclusory allegations, unwa1Tanted deductions of facts or legal conclusions 
masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Snow, 450 F.3d at 1320. 
I. 
Count I Fails to State a Cause of Action For Assault Recognized by 
Florida Law. 
The plaintiff attempts to plead a cause of action against Mr. Epstein for 
"sexual assault" based on a "violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes"3 for 
the "lewd and lascivious acts committed by Epstein upon Jane Doe." (Am. Compl. 
3 Chapter 800, Florida Statutes, is entitled, "Lewdness; Indecent Exposure." 
3 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 4 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
,T 18.) The plaintiff cannot assert a cause of action for "violation of Chapter 800, 
Florida Statutes" because there is no private right of action under that Chapter. 
See generally Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials Corp., 908 So. 2d 360, 
3 7 4 (Fla. 2005) ( observing that "not every statutory violation carries a civil 
remedy" (citing Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 842, 852 
(Fla. 2003)). See also, e.g., Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Ferre, 636 F. Supp. 970 
(S.D. Fla. 1985) (King, C.J.) (holding that violation of Florida's criminal extortion 
statute does not give rise to a civil cause of action for damages). 
Where a plaintiff brings a civil action pursuant to a criminal statute that 
provides no civil remedy, her complaint is properly dismissed for failure to state a 
cause of action. See Mantooth v. Richards, 557 So. 2d 646, 646 (Fla. 4th DCA 
1990) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs claim for parental kidnapping 
where "the mentioned statutes concern only criminal violations and do not afford 
a civil remedy") ( citation omitted) ( emphasis added). Accordingly, the plaintiffs 
claim for sexual assault against Mr. Epstein, pursuant to a violation of Chapter 
800, Florida Statutes, must be dismissed. 
Should the Court look beyond the plain language of the plaintiffs amended 
complaint and construe Count I as a claim for common-law assault, that claim 
would also fail. As the court explained in Lay v. Kremer, 411 So. 2d 1347, 1349 
(Fla. 1st DCA 1982), an assault is "an intentional, unlawful offer of corporal injmy 
4 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 5 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
to another by force, or force unlawfully directed toward another under such 
circumstances as to create a fear of imminent peril, coupled with the apparent 
present ability to effectuate the attempt." An assault thus requires "an affirmative 
act-a threat to use force, or the actual exertion of force." Sullivan v. At!. Fed. 
Sav. & Loan Assoc., 454 So. 2d 52, 54 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984) (affirming dismissal of 
assault claim where there was no affirmative act). 
In this case, there is no such affirmative act. The plaintiff does not allege that 
Mr. Epstein used force or even threatened to use force. Indeed, the only statements 
that Mr. Epstein is alleged to have said to the plaintiff are "to remove her clothes," 
"to sit on his back" and "to continue giving him a massage." (Am. Compl. ,r 13.) 
These allegations fall far short of an "offer of corporal injury by force." 
Accordingly, because the plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action for 
assault recognized in Florida, Count I against Mr. Epstein must be dismissed. 
II. 
Count II Fails Because Plaintiff Claims No Actionable Underlying Tort 
or Wrong. 
As a general rule, "[a]n actionable conspiracy [under Florida law] requires 
an actionable underlying tort or wrong. Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 
(Fla. 5th DCA 1984). A nan-ow exception to the general rule exists where "the 
plaintiff can show some peculiar power of coercion possessed by the conspirators 
by virtue of their combination." Churruca v. Miami Jai-Alai, Inc., 353 So. 2d 547, 
550 (Fla. 1977). "Where the concerted acts of the defendants do not create a 
5 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 6 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
greater hann than if the acts were committed by one person ... , there can be no 
recovery" under a claim for independent conspiracy. Martin v. Marlin, 529 So. 2d 
1174, 1179 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988). Clearly, this case is governed by the general rule 
because only one person could have caused the plaintiffs injuries. 
Here, the plaintiffs claim under Count II ( civil conspiracy) fails because it 
derives exclusively from Count I (violation of Chapter 800, Florida Statutes). See 
Buchanan v. Miami Herald Publ'g Co., 230 So. 2d 9, 12 (Fla. 1969) (holding that 
where Count I of the complaint had failed to state a cause of action for malicious 
prosecution, there could be no civil conspiracy claim in Count II "based on the 
allegations of Count I"). As noted above, the plaintiff cannot prevail on Count I 
because the statute she expressly pleads as its basis, Chapter 800, Florida Statutes, 
provides no civil remedy. 
Therefore, she cannot prevail on her claim for conspiracy ( Count II) to 
violate Chapter 800, Florida Statutes (Count I), and Count II of the amended 
complaint must be dismissed against Mr. Epstein. 
III. 
Count IV Cannot Stand Because Plaintiff Fails to Claim a Direct Injury 
Resulting from a Violation of a RICO Predicate Act. 
Section 772.104, Florida Statutes ("Civil Remedies for Criminal Practices") 
allows someone to bring a civil RICO claim only if "he or she has been injured by 
reason of' any RICO violation. § 772.104, Fla. Stat. (2007) ( emphasis added). 
The injury must be a direct result of a racketeering activity or RICO predicate act. 
6 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 7 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
See Baisch v. Gallina, 346 F.3d 366, 373 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[A] plaintiff does not 
have standing if he suffered an injury that was indirectly (and hence not 
proximately) caused by the racketeering activity or RICO predicate acts, even 
though the injury was proximately caused by some non-RICO violations 
committed by the defendant.). Thus, an injury allegedly caused by a non-RICO 
violation is insufficient to state a claim for civil RICO. See id. 
Here, the allegations in Count IV, even if they are true, do not add up to a 
civil RICO claim because the plaintiffs alleged injury was not caused by the 
violation of a RICO predicate act. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured "[a]s a 
direct and proximate result of Epstein's assault on Jane Doe," "in violation of 
Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes." (Am. Compl. ,-r,-r 18-19.) Chapter 800 of the 
Florida Statutes is not a RICO predicate act. See§ 772.102(a), Fla. Stat. (2003) 
(listing Florida's RICO predicate acts). By her own admission, the plaintiffs 
alleged injury was caused by a non-RICO violation. As a result, her claim cannot 
stand. 
In a doomed attempt to avoid this fatal flaw in her claim, the plaintiff lists a series 
of violations rooted in Florida's prostitution statutes. (Am. Compl. ,-r 31.) 
According to the amended complaint, the defendants participated in a criminal 
enterprise ... or conspir[ acy ]" (Am. Compl. ,-r 30) over an unspecified length of 
time "to repeatedly find and bring [Jeffrey Epstein] underage girls ... in order for 
7 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 8 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Epstein to solicit, coerce, entice, compel, or force such girls in acts of prostitution 
and/or lewdness." (Am. Compl. ,r 32). The alleged "pattern of criminal activity" 
comprises violations of Chapter 796, Florida Statutes-the chapter that proscribes 
various crimes of prostitution.4 
These allegations, however, do not tie directly into the plaintiffs alleged 
injuries - her alleged assault "in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes." 
(Am. Compl. ,r 18.) Indeed, the plaintiffs alleged injury has nothing to do with 
the facilitation of prostitution, or more succinctly, the violation of Florida's 
prostitution laws. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim must fail because there is no 
proximate cause between the purported "pattern of criminal activity" and the 
plaintiffs alleged injuries. 
Because the amended complaint does not satisfy the direct-injury 
requirement under Florida's RICO law, the plaintiff has failed to allege a cause of 
action against Jeffrey Epstein for violation of section 772.103, Fl01ida Statutes. 
Thus, Count IV of the amended complaint must be dismissed. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully 
requests that Counts I, II and IV of the plaintiffs amended complaint be dismissed. 
4 
The amended complaint alleges a "pattern of criminal activity" comprising the following 
criminal violations: §§ 796.03, 796.07(2)(f), 796.07(2)(h), 796.045, and 796.04, Fla. Stat. (Am. 
Compl. ,r 31.)
