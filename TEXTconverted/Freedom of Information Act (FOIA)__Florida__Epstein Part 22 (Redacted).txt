Okay. So you understand everything that's going on here and 
7 	
everything that I'm asking you, correct? 
8 
9 
Correct. 
10 
11 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Urn. Obviously I've explained that I am investigating a 
12 	
case, uh, involving a subject that you may know, urn, by the name 
13 	
of Jeffrey or Jeff Epstein. Uh, he's a resident in uh, Palm Beach. 
14 	
Um, I believe you may have some information pertaining to this 
15 	
case. Urn, if you could in your own words, urn, can you explain 
16 	
from the beginning, as to, uh, what happened, and 
17 
18 
There's like a year and a half, almost two years to go over. Like, 
19 
do you want me to go through everything, or do you want to 
20 	
specifically ask me stuff? 
21 
22 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//Well, ah, start from like how you met him, and then I'll, I'll take 
23 	
you through. 
24 
25 
//Okay. Um, 
heard me over talk — we worked at 
26 	
Hollister together in the Wellington Green Mall, and I was 
27 	
mentioning to her how I wanted extra money to go to Maine. Urn. 
28 
29 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Is that where you're from? 
30 
31 
No, but I wanted to go camping. I like to go camping. 
32 
33 	
DETECTIVE: 	
All right. 
34 
35 
	
So I wanted to go camping for the summer, and I couldn't afford a 
36 	
plane ticket. And 
 goes 'Oh, well, you can get a plane 
37 	
ticket in two hours.' I said, what are you talking about? Like, 
38 	
what are you, that didn't make any sense to me a plane ticket in 
39 	
two hours, what are you talking about? And she goes 'Oh, we can 
40 	
go and give this guy a massage, and, urn, he'll pay two hundred 
41 	
dollars for like forty-five minutes or an hour.' And that's all she 
42 	
told me no details no nothing. 
43 
44 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//Okay.

Urn, a couple of days later, I believe it was a Saturday night. I'm 
almost positive it was, cause I know I didn't have to go to school 
the next day. Urn, and definitely wasn't a Friday. So it next 
Saturday night after that. She set it up, and I picked her up from 
the her apartment, and we drove to the island and I worked, urn, 
and he paid her three or four hundred dollars to bring me. 
Okay. 
And that was it. 
All right. Um, and this was a year and a half ago, correct? 
Maybe two, I'm not sure, I didn't really keep track 
//Okay. How old were you when you first, uh, went over there? 
If it was two years ago I was sixteen, if it was a year and a half, I 
would have been sixteen or seventeen, I don't know. 
Okay. 
Like, I really don't know. 
Okay. When you first went to give a massage, urn, you were 
explained that, it was just a massage? 
Just a massage. 
Okay. Did she explain, urn, how you would have to be dressed to 
give a massage? 
She said that he wanted cute girls, so I looked cute, did my best, I 
didn't — I didn't think that it was what it was. I wasn't naïve 
enough to think that he was gonna pay me two hundred dollars just 
for nothing, [stutters] I, I don't know, like I don't know what was 
going through my head. I absolutely don't know. And I — the back 
of my mind I was thinking, oh, well, it could be legitimate, but I 
was also thinking, you know, at the same time, is she fucking 
crazy? Like, this guy's not gonna pay you money for not doing 
anything, not letting him cop a feel or nothing. You know? So I 
didn't know what to think, I was like oh, I'll just go and I'll feel it 
out and if I don't like it, I'll leave. Like, in the middle of it, like I 
don't care. If he does something that I have a problem with then 
I'll leave.

Uh huh.

DETECTIVE: 	
Take me from there. 
14 
15 
Pulled up to the service entrance, went up through the um, the little 
16 	
white gate that leads to the backyard. We, I pressed or she pressed 
17 	
the little intercom button thing, and uh, said 'It's — 	
, I have 
18 	
my friend with me.' And, they all knew I was coming. They knew 
19 	
me by name, greeted me with, like, Oh, 	
we're so happy to 
20 	
see you. You know, Jeffrey will be ready in a second. You know. 
21 
22 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Who were you introduced to? 
23 
24 
One of his girlfriends. One of his, like, slaves that he has live with 
25 	
him. And when I say slaves. like one of the girls that he bought to 
26 	
like have sex with him. Urn, I was introduced to one of them 
27 	
probably like... Sarah. I was introduced to Sarah. Urn, that's his 
28 	
assistant, I think, I think they have sex, but I don't know. Urn, I 
29 	
was introduced to his assistant Sarah and she's the one who told 
30 	
me that he would be ready in a second. And from there I met 
31 	
various other girls. I don't really, I didn't pay attention to who 
32 	
they were though. But I saw Sarah all the time after that so I 
33 	
remember her. 
34 
35 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. How were you brought, uh, to Jeffrey? 
36 
37 
Um, let me, I'm trying to remember. I went — there's a staircase in 
38 	
the kitchen, 
39 
40 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Uh huh. 
41 
42 
And I went through the staircase in the kitchen up to the master 
43

One has like a steam shower and then the other one's like this, the 
2 	
other one is like, urn, a regular, it's just a regular bathroom. But 
3 	
then there's another bathroom with a steam shower, and like, I 
4 	
don't know. There's two bathrooms in there, I'll just make it easy. 
5 	
There's two bathrooms. I was brought into the one bathroom, the 
6 	
massage bathroom with the steam shower, and 	
was with 
7 	
me, and Sarah was like 'Oh, just wait here, yadda yadda.' So 
8 	
-• 
and me were waiting on the couch in the bathroom, and, 
9 	
um, Jeffrey comes up and he's like 'Hey, I'm, I'm Jeffrey.' He 
10 	
just introduced himself and, he hands — _ 	
I remember this 
11 	
cause I was pissed off that she got paid to bring me. Like I was 
12 	
pissed off. He hands her a wad of hundred dollar bills and says 
13 	
'Thank you' and she says 'I'll wait for you downstairs' and I was 
14 	
like 'All right, I'll see you in a little while.' And that's how I was 
15 	
brought to Jeffrey. 
16 
17 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Take me through the massage. Uh, that first massage. 
18 
19 
Um. Hold on, I'm remembering, I'm like picturing in my head. I 
20 	
wore a skirt. I remember specifically what I wore, I wore a skirt 
21 	
and just a regular t-shirt. And I was massaging his legs, and he 
22 	
asked me to take off my skirt. And I said, I think I said no at first. 
23 	
And he's like, 'Come on, you're not showing' — he talked me into 
24 	
it basically, he's like 'Oh, you're not showing anything,' or did 
25 	
something, I don't even know. So I ended up taking off my skirt, 
26 	
and then he goes, well I think he just started touching, you know, 
27 	
the top of me. So and then he asked me 
28 
29 	
DETECTIVE 2: 	
When you're saying the top of you, you mean your breasts? 
30 
31 
Yeah. And then he asked me to take off my shirt. So I took off 
32 	
my shirt but I kept my underwear on. And I wouldn't take my 
33 	
underwear off, I told him no. And he still paid me the same 
34 	
amount. And that was that, I went home. 
35 
36 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. You had on your 
37 
38 
I had my panties on. 
39 
40 	
DETECTIVE:

41 
42 
Nothing else. I was topless

Yeah. [pause] What word do you want me to use, cause I already

told UI

//I don't want to be crude. 
22 
23 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Well, whatever word you're comfortable

//Okay, well I'll just say it, whatever. He masturbated. 
26 
27 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
28 
29 
While UI the massage. And the massage was over as soon as he 
30 	
was finished with himself. 
31 
32 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. So in other words, he 
33 
34 
Finished with himself and that was it, yeah. He ejaculated, 
35 	
specifically. 
36 
37 	
DETECTIVE: 	
// Okay. Okay. That was the very first time you went there. 
38 
39 
Uh huh. 
40 
41 	
DETECTIVE: 	
And, I know. Take a deep breath, I know, I can see it in your eyes 
42 	
already. Urn, from then on, you went there multiple times? 
43 
44 
I first told him, like, I had a problem with it, what happened the 
45 	
first time. But two hundred dollars for forty minutes, that was a lot 
46 	
for a sixteen-year-old girl making six bucks an hour.

I mean, I'm sorry, he is circumcised, my bad. He's circumcised, a

hundred and ten percent sure. A matter of fact, he has some sort of

birth defect. On his thing. I don't know what it is [giggles] I've

never like really looked at it, because I've never done anything 
6 	
where I had to touch it. I've never touched it out of the whole time 
7 	
I worked for him I never touched his penis. Like, he I'm pretty 
8 	
sure he he rubbed it against me, but I've never ever been like, okay 
9 	
I'm letting you do this or I'm gonna do this to you. Urn, it's really

29 
30 
Urn, it's like a teardrop, like a drop of water. It's really fat at the 
31 	
bottom and skinny at the top where its attached. And, he can never 
32 	
get fully hard, ever. Like, I just could tell by looking at it, like, by 
33 	
looking you can obviously tell if you're hard or not and I could tell 
34 	
that he wasn't. 
35 
36

Okay.

So I don't know if that's some sort of thing that's wrong with him,

17 	
I swear I never touched him, the whole entire time I never ever 
18 	
touched him. Urn, but he, he 
19 
20 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//How many times would you say you went? 
21 
22 
Hundreds. Hundreds, I was — he used to tell me I was his favorite. 
23 
He bought me a car. He bought me 
24 
25 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//This Jeep that you're driving? 
26 
27 
No. I had a brand new Dodge Neon. I got plane, I got a plane 
28 	
ticket to New York, I got spending money whenever I wanted. 
29 	
Like, I was in there deep. I was — he asked my parents to 
30 	
emancipate me so I could live with him. Or he didn't ask my 
31 	
parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I'm sorry. He act — he 
32 	
actually wanted me to come live with him. 
33 
34 	
DETECTIVE: 	
As like a girlfriend? 
35 
36 
Sex slave, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Um, but it 
37 	
escalated — he, he just increased my pay, as long as he could touch 
38 	
me. I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me. And then one 
39 	
day he just did, one day he just put his hand like his fingers. And 
40 	
urn, 
41 
42 	
DETECTIVE: 	
How long would you say, from the very first time you went, 
43 
44 
Months. Honestly, I never kept track, like of, of what happened 
45 
when. I just can tell you in which order things progressed.

Okay. 
But not specifically, oh, three months later he did this, three 
months later like, I can't do that. 
Okay. When he purchased the car, how far were you, urn. 
How old was I? 
Yeah. 
That what you mean? He bought the car in, [sigh] I gotta recall, I 
haven't thought about this in forever. Um. I can I can give you 
like four, four months that it possibly was during, but I can't 
specifically remember if it was before or after the New Year. Urn, 
November, December, January February, that just passed. 
Of 2004? 
Wait a second. 
So were you a senior in high school when you had the car? 
Yeah, it was recently. 
Okay. 
It was, it was like, towards the middle and end of my school year. 
But I remember that for the last like six or eight weeks of high 
school, I didn't have a car cause I gave it back to him. Because he, 
he asked me to have sex with him and like, like suck him and stuff 
[giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not. I was like, I'll let 
you touch me but I'm not gonna do that. 
This is 2005, right? 
Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the 
New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a 
year before they were supposed to come out. So if I got it, I 
obviously didn't get a 2006 cause that's this year. I got a 2005 
Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. That car was 
awesome [giggles]. 
Okay. And that's the car that you used to drive to and from, 
To and from school, just out with my friends.

What color was it?

Like a neon blue, like a really bright bright bright blue. It was

really pretty. Not that that makes a difference.

DETECTIVE: 	
And you gave it back?

13 
Yes. 
14 
15 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Was this after you graduated from high school, or 
16 
17 
No, I, I gave it back before I graduated. It got too, it got too sticky 
18 
for me. He wanted more than I was willing to give. I didn't 
19 	
wanna, I didn't want to urn suck his dick, I didn't want to have sex 
20 	
with him. I never did that and I wanted to be able to walk away 
21 	
from this saying that I, saying that I never did that. And I'm glad 
22 	
that I did. 
23 
24 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay.

28 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
29 
30 
But I lied to him when I gave it back, I didn't want to burn my 
31 
bridges because he was a spectacular connection to have. 
32 	
Spectacular. Even if I didn't — even when I didn't work for him, 
33 	
until this day, he is so aw — he is so, I haven't talked to him in like 
34 	
a couple months, but urn, as far as he can, as far as he knows, he's, 
35 	
well, I don't know how to, I'm sorry. [stutters] So many things 
36 	
are going through my head right now and I'm just getting a little 
37 	
tongue-tied. Urn. If I called him today he would give me as much 
38 	
money as I asked him for, he doesn't know that I hate him the way 
39 	
I do. I kept that connection. I figured he used me, I'd be able to 
40 	
use him. Urn, I hate to say that but I figured if I wanted to use him

I could.

Um. When did things start to escalate as far as things happening

They escalated whenever he wanted, I, I don't, I don't clearly

DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. The first time you went, you were naked, giving a massage

//Are you asking for a date? Or you're asking for how

DETECTIVE: 	
//No no no no, how [stutters] cause I know you don't have specific

DETECTIVE: 	
Right. 
17 
18 
Well, I went and I wouldn't take off my panties at first, and then he 
19 	
got me to get naked, then he got me to let him rub me, then he got 
20 	
me to let him stick his fingers in me, then he got me to let him go 
21 	
down on me. Then, urn... that was pretty much the, the breadth 
22 	
[rest?] of it, except this one time where he bent me over the table

and put himself in me.

//And I don't — I'm sorry to interrupt you but I don't count that as

me having sex with him, you know he did that, I, I don't, I, cause I 
37 	
just told you I never had sex with him. I never did. It's, you 
38 	
know, I don't know what you'd consider that. But, he then, I go 
39 	
'What are you doing?' He goes 'Oh, I just wanted Adrianna to see 
40 	
this.' Or 'I just wanted um Nadia to see this.' I'm sorry, I got the

DETECTIVE: 	
Urn, when you were completely naked, the same things happened, 
2 	
you went in, you massaged him, 
3 
4 
Sometimes I didn't even deal with that. Sometimes he just asked 
5 	
me to take off my clothes and like, he would have to do work, and 
6 	
he'd be sitting at his desk or something and I'd just be naked there 
7 	
watching television or reading a book but I'd be naked. Or, um, 
8 	
sometimes he wanted to just watch TV or read and he'd lay in his 
9 	
bed and he'd ask me to just take my clothes off and lay with him. 
10 	
And that's it, not touch him or anything and I'd get paid three 
11 	
hundred dollars for that for twenty minutes. Urn, sometimes he'd 
12 	
just invite me over for breakfast or dinner, or just to use the 
13 	
swimming pool, and I'd get paid for that too. 
14 
15 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
16 
17 
[sigh] I'd get paid just to hang out with him. That's it. And if, if 
18 	
the money wasn't there, I'd not been there, I wouldn't have ever 
19 	
been in that house.

I have a question.

DETECTIVE: 	
Yeah. 
26 
27 
Before I say anything else. Urn, is there a possibility that I'm 
28 	
gonna have to go to court or anything? Like, that's a possibility, 
29 	
right? 
30 
31 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Well, here's the thing. When this is all said and done, we're gonna 
32 	
sit down we're gonna discuss this. I mean, what he did to you is a 
33 	
crime. I'm not going to lie to you. You are a victim. 
34 
35 
//Will you consider rape? Like, will you consider that to be rape, 
36 
what he did? 
37 
38 	
DETECTIVE: 	
When he put himself inside you, without permission, forcibly 
39 
40 
//I didn't say yes or anything, he just, like I was standing up, and 
41 	
the table is about like my hip length, he just pushed me down.

He had quite a few girls he would say that to. 
I know, I thought so pretty much, you know. 
He had quite a few girls he would say that to. But, 
When did you, when was the last time you saw him? 
Urn before la — before the summer. 
May or June? When you gave the car back, or sometime before 
you graduated? 
//Probably, mhm. 
Wh, when did that incident 
//Or maybe a little after I graduated. I don't remember. 
When did that incident happen when he bent you over the table? 
I don't remember. 
Was it recent or was it like a year ago? 
It was probably in like, somewhere in the middle or, of the time 
that I worked there. It was definitely before December, if that's 
what you're trying to get at. 
Were you seventeen when you did that too? 
Oh, yeah, I was definitely. Definitely. 
Okay, we're gonna get to that in just a minute. Getting back to 
when you were naked, 
UI 
And you were providing the massages. 
And they were — and they were legitimate massages, by the way — I 
don't want to be in trouble for anything I didn't

bad experience, so I just want to be clear on that.

DETECTIVE: 	
Okay, well I'm telling you right now that I didn't even bring 
6 	
handcuffs with me up here. 
7 
8 
No, all right, I, [giggles] I don't know. And I mentioned it to 
9 	
somebody that I didn't say anything, but I mentioned that I had to 
10 	
go talk to police about something that was personal to my 
11 	
boyfriend, and. He just would flip out if he knew I was talking 
12 	
about this specific stuff with anybody. But um, [giggles] he was 
13 	
just like 'Make sure that you're not going to get investigated.' 
14

I can assure you you're not. 
16

24 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. All right, I was just just asking. Urn, when you were 
25 	
providing the massages and things started to escalate, urn, when he 
26 	
started to touch you, you said earlier. Was it with his hand or with 
27 	
something else? 
28 
29 
With his hand. Um, I remember, he would like, he would kiss me 
30 	
and stuff too. I remember that. Um, and when he kissed me, like 
31 	
if he was jerking off, he would, he would like rub himself, like on 
32 	
my breasts. I, I had no feeling, I, not, I don't [sighs]. I don't know 
33 	
how to make it sound 
34 
35 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//You were uncomfortable. 
36 
37 
Yeah, I was extremely uncomfortable and I would maneuver 
38 	
myself away from that activity. Urn, I'd like, just I'd get up and 
39 	
I'd move somewhere else, or I'd, I'd, I don't even remember. I 
40 	
would stop whatever was going on without saying 'Can you get the

fuck off me?' I would, I would stop it without saying stuff like

on the end and it vibrated, and he would use that. And then, for his 
17 	
birthday, Nadia and I went shopping. And urn, we got a bunch of 
18 	
toys, [laughs] which — I don't know how to tell you guys all this 
19 	
stuff without you thinking that I enjoyed this. Like, cause I had a

like I don't know what specifically y'all want to know, like. He

Okay. What kind of vi — UI what color vibrators did he use? 
35

like you see the gray, like the grayish, on the pipe.

and stuff were also involved. [sigh] Everything.

Okay. Did you ever stop him, say hey listen, I'm not, I'm not good

Yeah, yeah, definitely. Before I let him urn, like before things 
17 	
progressed where I would let him touch me, I would not let him do 
18 	
anything to me, even with stuff that wasn't attached to his body. I 
19 	
said no for a very long time until he upped it by like a hundred or

make myself feel a little bit better. Urn, well I don't know if you 
30 	
would count like him, he never actually put it on, but it was him 
31 	
me and Nadia in the bedroom, and we were all in bed together, and 
32 	
I was messing around with her, you know, and he was watching, 
33 	
and 
34 
35 	
DETECTIVE: 	
At his request? 
36 
37 
Every time except one time was at his request. The time that it 
38 	
was not his request was on his birthday. And instead of getting 
39 	
paid three hundred dollars, I got paid like five, six hundred dollars. 
40 	
Urn, it was a gift, I guess you could call it a gift from me and 
41 	
Nadia. Um, we went shopping at this like sex place on 
42 	
Okeechobee [ph], and um we bought a bunch of stuff and then we 
43 	
just went at it in front of him. And, I don't know. It's not like I 
44 	
was enjoying it either, like in my mind I'm like 'Oh god, when this 
45 	
is over, you're getting so much money.' Like that's what I would 
46 	
think of, I'd just close my eyes and think of something else.

Okay. Let's get to the point where he's actually inserting his, his 
fingers inside you. Urn, at what point, from when he started just 
touching you to the point where he actually put his fingers inside 
of you? 
He did that once in the beginning, and at the time I was, urn, dating 
somebody, and that person was aware of what I did. Urn, and was 
like — this person, by the way, who said this stuff that I'm about to 
tell you is like now a crack-head, like on drugs, so they're way 
wack, they're like crazy. And he was actually my boyfriend, he 
goes 'Oh I have no problem with it, as long as he's not putting 
anything inside of you.' 
I wouldn't let him put anything in me until one day he did just out 
of nowhere. And I said wait a second my boyfriend, you know, we 
had this thing, you can't do that. You know, I'm, I'm allowed to 
work here as long as you don't do that. And he said ok. Well, a 
couple months later I guess he assumed me and my boyfriend had 
broken up, and he just did it one day, he just did it without asking 
or anything. And then I said what are you doing I said you know 
that's not cool and he goes 'Oh I thought we did that last time.' 
And I said no we did not do that last time. And, then he goes, uh 
and then he just offered me more money. He's like, 'Well why 
don't I just give you something extra and we can try this out.' And 
I was like [sigh] all right. Very hard guy to say no to. I don't 
know if any of you guys ever talked to him. 
Persistent. 
Yeah. 
I haven't spoke with him but he is persistent from what I can tell. 
//Oh, yeah. Well if you talk to him I mean he straight up tries to 
control the situation. Every, every word that comes out of your 
mouth it seems like he knows what you are going to say. Like, 
that's his job, that's how he made his money is knowing what 
people are gonna say and what people are gonna do. 
What did he tell you he does for a living?

Well, there's a couple things, things that I found by myself, things 
3 	
that I've looked up on the intemet. Um, what he specifically told 
4 	
me when I asked him the first time was 'Oh I'm a brain scientist' 
5 	
and I said what the fuck is a brain scientist? I was like that's not a 
6 	
real job you're like tell me the truth but anyway I took that as he, 
7 	
he told me his explanation was 'It's my job to know how people's 
8 	
brains work' and I said, whatever the fuck that means, whatever, 
9 	
you know you're just some old guy, and I went home. And then I 
10 	
looked up on the internet, urn, about him and he was apparently an 
11 	
invest an he works for a financial firm and he would invest other 
12 	
people's money, like people sign their fortunes over to him he 
13 	
invests it and he gets commissions off of the money that they 
14 	
make. Umm and then he just takes, I know that he himself besides 
15 	
investing other people's fortunes you know he's invested all his 
16 	
money he owns tons of companies, umm sponsors sports teams, 
17 	
does stuff like that he makes his money everywhere. 
18 
19 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Right. 
20 
21 
And especially, he does a lot of modeling stuff with modeling 
22 	
agencies, and I know that he is involved in stuff like that also. 
23 
24 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
25 
26 
[giggle] You know what he promised me? I think the reason I held 
27 	
on so long is he promised me that I would get into NYU. That I 
28 	
would get into NYU and he would pay for it. And I waited and I 
29 	
waited and I scored great on my SATs, I got 4.0, like I did great in 
30 	
school. I filled out my application and he told me that it wasn't 
31 	
good enough. And, so I filled it out again and it was like three 
32 	
times so I'm pretty sure he wasn't checking into it he was just 
33 	
telling me that he was. But I think that has a lot to do with the 
34 	
reason I stayed there so long. Cause my dream was like right in 
35 	
front of me, you know. It was so close. 
36 
37 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Aside from having been with Na, uh, Nada or Nadia um was there 
38 	
anybody else that you brought to the house? 
39 
40 
	
I brought a few people. Urn, I brought 
She 
41 	
approached me actually cause it, it got out that I did this, like 
42 	
everyone at school knew. You know, everyone talks all 
43 
44 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//Well, it was a circle and

1 
It was a little circle and then yeah one girl told oh I got Alex to do 
2 	
this and then you know. He, not that I would want anybody to get 
3 	
involved in this but I brought girls I didn't like and really frankly 
4 	
did not give a shit about. Girls that I knew were skanks that would 
5 	
do anything. Who, like, girls that would just like suck dick in the 
6 	
bathroom at school. Like not even people that I was friends with 
7 	
I'd just hear a rumor about a girl and be like hey I know a way you 
8 	
can make two hundred dollars. But I would tell them before they 
9 	
went I would tell them flat out like this is what you gotta do, are 
10 	
you cool with this cause I am not going to take you if you're not. 
11 	
And I told them, they all knew that I got paid to bring them. And 
12 	
I, it was 	
Mandy Biorklin. Mandy never did anything 
13 	
though, she took off her shirt — she was a little overweight so he 
14 	
didn't want anything to do with [laughs], she was my best friend so 
15 	
I you know she was another story, I did care about her but urn she 
16 	
lost her house and stuff and really needed money. She had, she 
17 	
was homeless she had nowhere to go. So she did it out of 
18 	
desperation. But um I, the only people I can think of w
19 	
and Mandy. I might have asked other people but I don't think I 
20 	
ever actually brought other people. 
21 
22 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Did anything ever happen between you and the two girls 
23 	
that you brought there? 
24 
25 
Mandy, she was really nervous so she wanted me to go in with her. 
26 	
And I stayed with her, urn, I took all my clothes off and I did my 
27 	
regular thing, and she just took her shirt off. And then he said 
28 	
'Okay well 	
is gonna finish up here, do you want to go wait by 
29 	
the pool' and she went downstairs and went swimming and I was 
30 	
still naked. 
31 
32 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
33 
34 
And that was that. 
35 
36 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
37 
38 
She got paid I think three, two or three hundred dollars for that, 
39 	
probably two because it was her first time. The way it went was if 
40 	
you worked there for the first like three times, you got paid two 
41 	
hundred dollars. After that, if you were persistent and worked all 
42 	
the time it was the on average three hundred dollars. Sometimes I 
43 	
got paid a thousand. Just for the same thing. No varying in 
44 	
activities, just sometimes I'd walk out of there with a thousand 
45 	
dollars or I mean I got lots of gifts, like I got lots of stuff from this 
46 	
guy. I don't know.

Okay, what about
3

 she just went up in the room and did her thing and she 
5 	
continued to work for him afterwards. I don't know, I don't think 
6 	
she still does, urn, she may, may not. I don't know. 
7 
8 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Okay. Urn, you went quite a few times with the Neon. 
9 	
And, you actually had an encounter with one of his doormen, when 
10 	
you were coming to get an envelope. 
11 
12 
//That was in my Riata, actually, I drove a little Riata. Um, I was 
13 	
coming to get an envelope with two thousand dollars in it, my 
14 	
Christmas bonus. Umm, oh my god it and the cop actually was 
15 	
like how do you know Jeffrey and I was like all I I'm friends with 
16 	
his girlfriend I use his pool every once in a while, or something, 
17 	
but that was crazy. Yeah he the housekeeper just was expecting 
18 	
me, but he didn't know, he was gone when I arrived and he came 
19 	
home and saw that there was a car and he didn't realize that it was 
20 	
my car. But he was expecting me urn so he called the police and I 
21 	
was like what the fuck man I'm just coming here to pick up 
22 	
money. [giggles] But that was that. 
23 
24 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Let's get to the part where, urn, things escalated. Urn, I 
25 	
have to see something. 
26 
27 
UI 
28 
29 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Yeah, let me go ahead and stop this tape and start another one 
30 	
because it's almost at the end. 
31 
32 
	
[to friend] You don't have anything important to go do, do you? 
33 
Okay. 
34 
35 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay, at this point I'm gonna go ahead and stop the tape. The time 
36 	
by my watch is approximately 5:02 p.m. [pause] Uh, 5:02, 5:03 
37 	
p.m. Um, we're just about to get started with the, as it escalated. 
38 	
Urn, tell me how it, how it happened. 
39 
40 
He would just try things on occasion and if I let him do it then he 
41 	
would at the end put in more money without even like, it was kind 
42 	
of an unspoken thing, if it happened and I let it happen I'd get paid 
43 	
more. If it didn't happen then obviously it was the same. But urn, 
44 	
on a few occasions I told you, that I did say no. Um, and I let it be 
45 	
UI and I'd say stop on my word, and he still gave me extra money 
46 	
on that one. But then the couple of times that I said no he talked

2 	
more money, even if I never, even if I didn't do what he asked me 
3 	
to do extra. 
4 
5 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. So walk me through this, and and I know this is gonna be 
6 	
hard for you. Uh, walk me through this here. You're giving him a 
7 	
massage, you're naked. Right? 
8 
9 
Uh huh. 
10 
11 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Take it from there. 
12 
13 
He'd ask me to like, most of the time, I'd rub his lower back UI 
14 
15 	
[Cell phone interference; voices inaudible for about forty seconds.] 
16 
17 
...like, he didn't have to say any instructions. When I first started 
18 
going, I, he'd ask me to get naked, he'd ask what he could do, I 
19 	
mean, urn, and that was like that. Towards the end, like, I just got 
20 	
naked and, 
21 
22 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Would he, would he perform oral, oral sex on you? 
23 
24 
//Sometimes, sometimes. 
25 
26 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Did you ever perform anything on him? 
27 
28 	
I've never touched him inten — intentionally. I've never laid a 
29 	
hand on him, not a body part, nothing, not a hair on my head. I 
30 	
never touched him. 
31 
32 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. When he did oral on you, were you still sixteen? Was this 
33 	
towards the beginning? 
34 
35 
Yeah, it wasn't like, at the, at the end, like all this stuff was in the 
36 
beginning. Like, once we broke the barriers of me like letting him 
37 	
do stuff, all the major stuff took, took place in the beginning. Urn, 
38 	
I never, that was only like four, five times and none of it was since 
39 	
my birthday, since this last birthday none of it was after that. 
40 
41 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Did he ever hurt you?

He pulled my hair a lot harder than it should have been pulled, like 
2 
he, okay I can understand having sex, and you're all like, not, not 
3 	
that we were having sex but I mean like if you're all into it and you 
4 	
pull hair a little bit, like my ponytails just like a little bit, whatever. 
5 	
But he would pull it to where it would rip my hair out. It would rip 
6 	
my hair, and then sometimes he would pick me up and like throw 
7 	
me whichever way he wanted me, and then he would just like use a 
8 	
toy or like his hand or whatever. Never his penis though, ever, I 
9 	
never had sex with him. But urn 
10 
11 	
DETECTIVE: 	
But you're a little girl, I mean, so, 
12 
13 
I'm little, so he could pick me up, like, if you pick me up and 
14 	
throw me, obviously it's gonna hurt. If I get hurt, um

16 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Did you ever tell him that hurts you?

your vagina area?

Urn, I don't know, I'm sure he was a little rough on occasions, but 
29 	
none specifically, nothing that really stands out. I mean, there's 
30 	
been nights that I walked out of there barely being able to walk,

Like, I've gotten thousands of dollars worth of shit. Man, the 
2 	
underwear I'm wearing right now, he gave me, like I'd, I'd go over 
3 	
there and there'd be a bag of Victoria's Secret underwear like 
4 	
waiting for me like, talking like fifteen hundred dollars worth of 
5 	
stuff I got a plane ticket from him once, I got a car, I got 
6 	
Christmas bonuses, I got movie tickets, like he'd buy me movie 
7 	
tickets, like he'd say 'Hey, have you gone to the movies lately?' 
8 	
I'd be like I dunno, no, not really, he goes 'Do you want to go?' 
9 	
He'd give me like eight movie tickets. I got show tickets, I went 
10 	
and saw like David Copperfield I had like VIP like tickets or 
11 	
something like that. Um. 
12 
13 	
DETECTIVE 2: 	
The car, was that under your name or was it under his name? 
14 
15 
No, it was under his, like I didn't really care though, he'd let me 
16 	
drive it around as much as I wanted. You know, I, I just got the 
17 	
keys to it. And everything else was his business. He said if I ever 
18 	
got pulled over, just to say that it was his car and whatever, that's 
19 	
it. 
20

towards the end of my session or whatever you want to call it, so

she was probably either getting dressed or was still naked, I don't

If I went there, if I saw her up there I would not be surprised. I

sometimes she would just, like, she liked me. Like, she would

eat breakfast together. Or like hang out by the pool or something,

Nadia was — no, we, I was, this was at the end of like what, okay it 
6 	
was me him and Nadia and I'm pretty sure that me and Nadia, like 
7 	
she was like sucking his dick and like fucking him and stuff. But 
8 	
like, that was all I was like maybe kissing her, you know touching 
9 	
her some which way or the other. And um, towards the end of this 
10 	
I remember that I had already finished, cause I remember it being 
11 	
really uncomfortable. So I remember specifically that I had 
12 	
already finished. She, it was me, him 
13 
14 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//What do you mean by you finished with? 
15 
16 
He gave me an orgasm. With his hand. 
17 
18 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//Right. Okay. 
19 
20 
Urn, UI I need to show you, like what I'm talking about, like the 
21 	
positioning that we were. It was like, okay, here's the thing, 
22 	
there's the like little flower thing, then here's the massage table. I 
23 	
was right here, he was right here, she was here. Urn. And, I was 
24 	
standing up, and he just pushed me over the table, and he did his 
25 	
thing with me. 
26 
27 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Were you facing the table? Were you? 
28 
29 
I was, I was face down on the table. Like face down, hands like on 
30 	
my head, holding, I don't, I don't I mean I wasn't fighting really. 
31 	
So I don't know if he was holding me down to kinda stop me from 
32 	
fighting, or what he was doing. He's just a really weird, he's into 
33 	
really weird stuff. Like, I was just bent over and my face was on 
34 	
the table I was face down on the table. And then he did his thing. 
35 	
So. But anyway, Nadia was right here and I'm pretty sure she was 
36 	
naked and the couch is like right behind, but urn that's how it 
37 	
happened. 
38 
39 	
DETECTIVE: 	
How long was he, how long did that take? 
40 
41 
He was only in me for like a minute or two, I don't even know if 
42 	
you could say that long. He put it in, did a couple of pumps or 
43 	
whatever the fuck you wanna call it, and I was like 'What are you 
44 	
doing?' [giggles] I go 'What are you doing?' He's like, 'Oh, I just 
45 	
wanted Nadia to see this.' Then that was that.

DETECTIVE: 	
Did he ejaculate inside? 
2 
3 
	
No. Not in me, not on me. I don't remember any time. I don't 
4 	
remember specifically that time, um whether or not he finished 
5 	
from having sex with me or whatever you wanna call it. 
6 
7 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. How much did you call — that was in the middle of the two 
8 	
year thing? 
9 
10 
Not so much towards the end, but definitely once I was 
11 
comfortable with working there once I like would go there a lot, 
12 	
yeah. That was, it had to be towards the middle cause towards the 
13 	
end I only worked very sporadically throughout like maybe once or 
14 	
twice a month, not even. Urn, in the middle I was working the 
15 	
most, I'd work every day that he was in the country. Every single 
16 	
day. 
17 
18 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. From that moment on, that's when the car came in? After 
19 	
that the car came? 
20 
21 
I told him that my parents kicked me out, urn, well, oh. Okay, this 
22 	
is how it went. Like I'm sorry, I'm remembering more and more 
23 	
as I talk to you. I worked for him and then I, I think after like 
24 	
things started getting like too like in like once he started going 
25 	
further and further, urn I stopped working for him for a little while. 
26 	
Like, Sarah left a message on my cell phone. My mom took my 
27 	
cell phone away and she checked my messages and Sarah goes 
28 	
'Oh, Jeffrey wants to know if you can come by and bring a friend.' 
29 	
And my morn goes 'What the fuck are you doing? Like, are you a 
30 	
prostitute?' And I was like, `No mom, I'm just a secretary, and 
31 	
you know what, he has a girlfriend, Nadia urn doesn't have any 
32 	
friends,' I'm like 'she wanted me to bring over people to hang out, 
33 	
you know.' And my mom was like, okay, I don't know. She was 
34 	
in denial, obviously, she, I think she knows that deep down in her 
35 	
heart. But urn, after my morn heard that message she made me 
36 	
phone him, she made me call Sarah, urn, and tell her right in front 
37 	
of my— my mom made me tell Sarah right in front of her that I 
38 	
couldn't work there anymore, that I couldn't go there anymore. 
39 	
And then a few months went by at, no like, well I guess you could 
40 	
say like a month or two, I don't want to say a couple, like a few 
41 	
months cause it wasn't that long. But it was like a month or two, 
42 	
and then I called him and urn, I told him that I, my parents kicked 
43 	
me out and so they weren't, they weren't gonna interfere with 
44 	
anything and then I continued to work. Towards the end, I stopped 
45 	
working for about probably six weeks, um, cause my boyfriend 
46 	
Will, the kid that I'm still with now. Urn, he, it like tore him up to

know that I did this with somebody. Cause he, he cares a lot about 
2 	
me and stuff, and I stopped working but then I lied to, I lied to Will 
3 	
a couple times and I worked, but then Will found out. And that's 
4 	
when, like he, he broke up with me, and then that once he broke up 
5 	
with me that was what I needed to really snap me into reality and 
6 	
quit. But there was like a few, like a, like I'd say a three month, 
7 	
like three and a half months like during that time, 
8 
9 	
DETECTIVE: 	
This year? 
10 
11 
Well this year was only like, maybe six weeks that I didn't work, 
12 	
but since the New Year, since the beginning of this New Year, 
13 	
from January to like April, in between then was probably six 
14 	
weeks where I didn't work. Urn, and then I don't remember when 
15 	
my other hiatus was, like I don't really remember but that was 
16 	
towards like the beginning. 
17 
18 	
DETECTIVE: 	
What, what did you do with all the money that you made? 
19 
20 
Do I have to tell you? Cause I don't think it's any of your business 
21 	
[laughs]. 
22 
23 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay, you don't have to. 
24 
25 
I'm sorry. I'm not like involved in drugs or anything like that, but, 
26 	
I really just don't wanna tell you. 
27 
28 	
DETECTIVE: 	
That's fine. 
29 
30 
Cause I don't have anything to show for any of it. I spent it all. I 
31 	
spent it all.

was in New York on his dime. So, yeah. 
41 
42 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Were you there on his plane? 
43 
44 
No, not on his plane. He was using his plane, I think he had to do

something. He has, owns an island in the Caribbean, you guys all

and he had some work to do. He was going to originally, urn, fly 
2 	
me in his jet, but something happened with work and it just worked 
3 	
out better, so he paid for my ticket and then, because he was, he 
4 	
was supposed to be in New York when I went there, I was 
5 	
supposed to stay at his home but like I said he had to use his plane 
6 	
to go somewhere else unexpectedly. So I stayed with urn, my 
7 	
boyfriend's family while I was up there. But while I was up there 
8 	
he bought me like, four hundred dollar front row seats to Phantom 
9 	
of the Opera. Like he, he set it up real nice. He gave me spending 
10 	
money, paid for my plane ticket, he paid for everything. 
11 	
Everything. 
12 
13 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Have you ever been on his plane? 
14 
15 
No, I've seen it though, I've been to the airport and I've seen it. It 
16 	
has a JE, Julia Echo — urn sorry, that's like, I just remember that's 
17 	
what he told me it meant. It's a black plane, there's a black one 
18 	
and then there's like, I forget what the other one was like. I saw 
19 	
that one, the other one from afar. He has a black plane and then 
20 	
another plane. 
21 
22 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. Has he tried to contact you recently, or 
23 
24 
Yeah, I could call him today and be like I need — like 
25 
26 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//No, but I'm talking about recently like within the past couple of 
27 	
weeks. Like from the beginning of — 
28 
29 
//Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Urn, but only, only through email and 
30 	
my responses have been — I haven't responded, um, recently since 
31 	
I was contacted before but urn the last two contacts I had with him 
32 	
was before I moved here, urn, which I moved here on August 
33 	
Sometime before I moved here I told him or I wrote in an email 
34 	
that somebody mysteriously — do you need to stop? 
35 
36 	
DETECTIVE: 	
No. 
37 
38 
I told him that somebody mysteriously called my house and told 
39 	
my parents, excuse me and told my parents urn, what I did with 
40 	
him, and I just was like, I made it seem like somebody called and 
41 	
ratted me out to my mom and dad. And I was like I can't, you 
42 	
know, work for you as of right now, urn, blah blah blah. But at 
43 	
that point, I mean, I don't, I didn't want to work for him, I just 
44 	
didn't want to burn my bridge, if you catch my drift. Urn, so I just 
45 	
told him that I got ratted out, and then he answered, or actually it's

his assistant answered, but it's really, it's him, if you're talking to 
say, to his assistant 
//Sarah, you're talking about Sarah. 
//you're talking to him. Yeah, I'm talking about Sarah specifically. 
Sarah and Nada are not the same people. 
No, Nadia is urn some other chick, she's like his girlfriend or 
whatever you want to call it, and then 
 is one of his 
girlfriends also, I, I know her and then Sarah. And Sarah she's like 
his main assistant, like his official assistant who really does his 
assistant work. 
Who travels with him. 
Who travels with him and stuff like that. He has other girls that he 
calls assistants but they just screw him. That's it. Urn. I don't 
know. I'm, I'm sorry, I like go off on a tangent and I completely 
forget what the original thing was. 
Urn. We were talking about if you ever flew in the plane, or have 
you recently talked to 
//UI 
Oh, I'm sorry I was talking about the emails, I hate when I do that, 
I apologize. 
No, that's all right. 
Um, uh, he answered me with 'That's really unfortunate, blah blah 
blah, well if you need any help with school, any costs, tuition, 
books, anything like that, just let me know.' Urn, so I wrote back 
and I just asked, urn, I said [cell phone interference] and UI, you 
know, from him wrote accounting negotiation and basic law, like I 
remember that [laughs], he wrote those and um. He again 
reminded me that if I wanted anything, any like if I needed any 
financial help or anything like that, that he would set it up, he 
would help me out. No problem. And I haven't, I haven't 
contacted either of them since. And that was probably four or six

he has naked photos of other teenage girls like around his house. 
One thing that really bothered me though, he has a picture of his g-
d-daughter like, with no like panties on, and it always grossed me 
out. Like it's a picture of her, like she's mooning him and I don't 
know if you can, I wouldn't put a picture like that in my house, 
honestly. Like that, that causes a little — it raises a few questions, 
like it can, it's questionable if it can be considered pornography. 
Child pornography. But I wouldn't put a picture of a little girl with 
her skirt pulled up on my wall. Like no.

No, not with me there. I was just thinking, I don't remember

No I was under the impression that that was Nadia. She told me 
that she came from Yugoslavia when she was like fifteen with 
Jeffrey. So like I don't understand what the hell is going on 
You know that girl? [showing picture] 
I don't, no. I don't know, she looks like every other girl. 
Well, I don't have anything further do you? 
Did you show her the picture of the one girl or no? 
I did 
But that's not the same person she's saying 
No, that's not the same person. 
And the last time you spoke to him on the phone, was what six 
weeks ago? Or longer than that 
Probably even longer. 
//Did they leave you any messages recently? No one ever 
contacted you or anything? 
No, um I think I even deleted the emails, if my boyfriend found 
those emails he'd shoot me, I'd get kicked out of the house. Like, 
so I, I'm pretty sure they're gone, I deleted them. 
You remember his uh screen name? 
Uh, its Sarah's it's JKELLENS@earthlink.net

anything else to the statement? 
No. 
What do you want to see happening to Jeffrey? 
I don't think anything is going to happen to him. 
No that's not what I asked you. What do you think should happen 
to Jeffrey for what he did to you? 
He, I don't even care if he goes to jail, I just don't want this to 
happen to anybody else. Whatever that means to you guys. 
And that's what we're trying to stop here. 
Yeah, that, it means a lot.

girlfriend. She was our immediate superior. 
2 	
Q. 	
Did he have girls come over to give 
3 	
massages? 
4 	
A. 	
Yes. 
5 	
Q. 	
How many massages would he have in a day? 
6 	
A. 	
Sometimes one, sometimes two, three. 
7 	
Q. 	
Was it the same girl that would come back 
8 	
to do the massages? 
9 	
A. 	
Yeah, yeah. Not the same girl 	
I mean 
10 during eleven years, I probably saw a hundred, two 
11 	
hundred different massage therapists. 
12 	
Q. 	
Did they seem young to you? 
13 	
A. 	
No, sir. Mostly no. We saw one or two 
14 	
young ones in the last year. Before that, it was all 
15 	
adults. 
16 	
Q. 	
During your last year when you were working 
17 	
with him, what do you mean that they looked young? Did 
18 	
they look like they were still in high school? 
19 	
A. 	
I remember one girl was young. We never 
20 	
asked how old she was. It was not in my job. 
21 	
Q. 	
Right. I understand. 
22 	
A. 	
But I imagine she was 16, 17. In my 
23 	
judgment, she was 16, 17. 
24 	
Q. 	
Where would these massages take place? 
25 	
A. 	
All the time it was in his room. Sometimes

in the house -- and then there's another door going into 
2 	
his room. So it was a long corridor. So everything was 
3 	
closed and nobody saw anything. 
4 	
Q. 	
Would you clean up after? 
5 	
A. 	
Once in a while, yes, I did. Most of the 
6 	
times I did. I did the cleanup. 
7 	
Q. 	
Did it appear as if there was going to be 
8 more than one massage going on in the room? 
9 	
A. 	
More than one massage? I don't know. It 
10 was massages. There was massages, because it was a hot 
11 	
oil, and it was -- you know this vibrator, the neck 
12 	
vibrators with the long handles. And towels, a lot of 
13 	
towels. We used a lot of towels in the house. Used like 
14 maybe 40, 50 towels a day, because every time he go in 
15 	
into the pool, it was two or three towels. Everything 
16 had to be cleaned up. I went most of the time to pick up 
17 	
the room and get it ready. 
18 	
Q. 	
Did it ever appear to you that more went on 
19 in the room other than a massage? 
20 	
A. 	
I just imagine. I never saw anything. But 
21 	
I imagine there was more than 	
I never saw anything 
22 	
because it was closed doors. It was never done outside. 
23 
Based on the cleanup? 
24 	
A. 	
Based on the cleanup -- at the end, I 
25 	
cannot say there was. At the end, it was a few times

that the bed was undone. You know, we make the beds 
2 	
three or four times a day. And sometimes we went to 
3 	
clean up the massage to put it back, the massage table, 
4 	
to pick up the towels, but the bed was undone again. So 
5 	
either he took a nap or he went for a nap, I don't know. 
6 	
Q. 	
Or something else occurred? 
7 	
A. 	
Or something else. I cannot. 
8 	
Q. 	
Did the girls, would they bring their own 
9 	
stuff or they would use his stuff? 
10 	
A. 	
No. We had everything. We had gallons of 
11 	
stuff, different stuff. 
12 	
Q. 	
Different massage oils? 
13 	
A. 	
Different, all kinds. 
14 	
Q. 	
Different massagers? 
15 	
A. 	
Different stuff. 
16 	
They would buy all over the world different 
17 	
types of -- for different 
18 	
Q. 	
Did any of these massagers look like sex 
19 toys? 
20 	
A. 	
At the end, at the last year that we were 
21 	
there they had like sex toys, some of them. I can say 
22 maybe three or four occasions that I saw in the sink, 
23 	
they were left out on the sink, and just -- 
24 	
Q. 	
Where would he keep these massagers? 
25 	
A. 	
When I was there, we keep all the stuff in

Okay.

And, when I was in that guy's room, there was a like, where the drawers of lotion 
4 
were, there's like a shelf of pictures and he had so many pictures of girls about 
5 
16, 17, around that age, 17 or 18. And they were like on the walls and most 
6 
of....all the girls were topless or just plain naked. And they were in positions or 
7 
they were just standing up. 
8 
MP: 
Okay. 
9 
Looking at pictures. 
10 
MP: 
Okay. Well, I have to ask you. Do you know the difference between....and 
11 
you're a grown woman, so I'm asking you. You're pretty mature for your age. 
12 
Okay? Do you know the difference between right and wrong? 
13 
Yes. 
14 
MP: 
Do you know the difference between the truth and a lie? 
15 
yes. 
16 
MP: 
Can you tell me what a lie would be? 
17 
Urn, not saying the truth. 
18 
MP: 
Okay. So if I tell you you are wearing a blue sweater right now 
19 
I could tell you you're lying. 
20 
MP: 
Why? 
21 
Because I'm wearing a pink one. 
22 
MP: 
You got it. Is everything you've told me the truth? 
23 
Yes.

Det. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the 
South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was 
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the 
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered 
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The 
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL 
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active 
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power 
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the 
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU, 
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the 
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt. 
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were 
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence 
Custodians. 
I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a 
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer 
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on. 
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software, 
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active 
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed 
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other 
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was 
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic 
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related 
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and 
turned over the Evidence Custodians. 
This concluded my participation in the search of the residence.

On December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to 
subpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez, 
who resides in Miami, had eluded the process servers previously and 
was not served the investigative subpoena. a: telephone message was 
left as she is not available during the week of 12/19/2005i) I made 
contact with State Attorney Inv Theresa Wyatt and requeste the same 
via telephone message. 
I then researched the victim's
cellular telephone subpoena data 
which had been received from a previous subpoena request. I analyzed 
the records which depict several calls from Haley Robson. The 
telephone calls start on February 6, 2005 at 12:49 pm.; the same day 
which the victim and the victim's father stated the incident occurred 
at Epstein s house. The first incoming call was from Robson's 
residence at 561 333-0180. The second incoming call from Robson's

from
one. On March 7, 2006, at 11:03 am, 
made a call 
to the victim 	
which lasted 492 seconds (8 minutes and 2 seconds). 
The victim then returned the call at 11:16 am which lasted 6 seconds. 
The victim then made contact w
 11:22 am for 877.2 seconds 
(14 minutes and 6 seconds). These sequences of calls were consistent 
with what the victim had described to me on the date of the 
intimidation. Immediately after speaking with the victim
 makes 
a call to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, which lasts for 
forty-e9ht seconds. A call is then immediately received, a telephone 
number registered to a Corporation affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein 
located at 457 Madison Ave in New York.. An extensive computer check 
revealed 457 Madison Ave is a business address in which Epstein has 
his corporations assigned to. Epstein had corporation attorney, 
Darren Indyke, register the businesses and register himself as an 
agent. I also observed Epstein has his El Zorro Ranch Corporation, 
New York Strategy Group, Ghislaine Corporation, J Epstein and Company 
and the Financial Strategy Group registered to this same address. 
Finally, a third call is received by 	
at 12:02 pm from the same 
corporate number which lasts 12 minutes and 1 second. It should be 
noted that there is no further contact with either the victim during 
the month of March or April of 2006. I also noted that there was no 
further contact. with Sarah Kellen or Jeffrey Epstein during the 
mainder of the month of March or April 2006. 
COn June 1, 2006, ASA Lana Belohlavek telephoned me to inform me' of the 
meeting that occurred with Atty. Jack Goldberger and her reference 
this case. She advised she would make her determination pn whether to 
file on this case or not by Monday June 5, 2006

cellular phone 561-308-0282 occurred at 1:02 pm. The call durations 
were one minute or less. The time frame was within thirteen minutes 
apart. It should be noted that Robson s residence was in close 
proximity to the victim's. The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the 
victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after 
the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson. 
Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson's cellular 
telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6, 
2005. 
Additionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from 
305-710-5165. The subscriber information confirmed that the number is 
registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was 
crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private 
Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which 
also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located 
another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which 
Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy 
Black is among his clientele. 
The telephone calls revealed Lavery had telephone contact with
11•1111 either just after I attempted to 
interview them, or just prior. A background was conducted on Lavery 
which revealed he holds a current Private Investigator License. A 
criminal arrest record revealed he had been previously arrested for 
possession of cocaine and solicitation of prostitution. 
also researched the girls using www.myspace.com. This web site is a 
new social networking service that allows members to create unique

As we entered onto the property, we encountered the house manager, 
Janusz Banasiak who was in the guest portion of the house. The 
guesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made. 
made contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth 04-07-1953, Fl DL 
 and informed him of the search warrant for the 
premises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence 
and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and 
members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr 
Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior 
decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of 
515 W 20th Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for 
Mr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2005 to 
do a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone 
with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr. 
Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised, 
his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never 
witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or 
Nada. 
I then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 315 East 14th Street in New York. 
Mr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised 
he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr. 
Epstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein's 
assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with 
Epstein everywhere he goes. 
I interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey. 
Bailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and.has worked with Zeff 
for only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not 
seen him. The interview was then concluded. 
I then spoke with Douglas Schoettle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York 
City. Schoettle stated he has been Epstein's Architect for seven 
years. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and 
speaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoettle stated he mainly speaks 
with Sara Kellen, Epstein s main assistant, who travels with Epstein. 
Schoettle stated he only has contact with Epstein when his services 
are needed. 
At approximA.tely 10:30 am, I was informed that the videotaping was 
concluded. LT entered the residence and located two covert (hidden) 
cameras. The first camera was a covert wall clock in the garage area. 
I traced the wire behind the clock and removed the RCA wire and 
unplugged the camera. The other covert camera was located within a 
desk clock beside Epstein's desk. I traced the wire behind the clock 
and unplugged the RCA wire] I could not locate another camera. I 
then began with the search of the residence for the specified 
evidence.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a 
transcript for fiRlin Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E EpsteinElocated a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
-hich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
.rich showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk) 
On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met w

Ilk to the house to "work." They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. fri, was unable to 
remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom.and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom.ii, described the bathroom as a large

Entered By.: OREGERO, LAURA D. 	
10/06/03 
 
On Sunday 10/5/03 at approximately 0824 hours, I 
was dispatched to a burglary at 358 El Brillo Way. Upon 
arrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white 
male, dob/012053. Epstein advised he and hie personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/052579, arrived in 
the residence on Friday evening, 10/3/03. Epstein advised 
that on Saturday evening 10/4/03, he left his briefcase at his 
desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein 
said when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately 
$5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100 
bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase. 
Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday, 
10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had 
been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein 
believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase. 
Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was 
sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black 
Clock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind 
his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been 
taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was 
in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day 
weekend Aug. 30-Sept 1, 2003. The second time was a 
weekend in mid September, 2003. Epstein stated he did not

report these incidents because he was not sure the money 
was accounted for. Possible footage of the incident may 
exist. I next met with Kellen who advised she went to bed at 
approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see 
anything unusual through the night or on the morning of 
10/5/03. Cotrin, the resident chef advised that he went to 
bed at approximately 1030 pm on 10/4/03 and began work at 
approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03. Cotrin stated that he did 
not see or hear anything unusual from the staff residence 
locate don the east side of the property. I next spoke to Mike 
and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike 
stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately 
8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm 
same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said 
he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on 
10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated 
that she checked the exterior of the residence at 
approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties. 
Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything 
appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at 
approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30 
on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie 
Friedman have been employed as the house managers since 
9/24/03. Prior to them, the live on site house managers were 
Patrick and Evelyn, Epstein was unsure of the last name. 
Patrick Evelyn were employed at 358 El Brillo approximately 
9 months. Prior to the house manager was John Alessi who 
was employee at 358 El Brillo approximately 10 years. 
Epstein signed an affidavit of prosecution, it is attached to 
this report. Crime Scene manager Parkinson responded and 
processed the scene. Det. Melnichok also responded. See 
Det. Melnichok's report for further information. Officer Nault 
responded and conducted a neighborhood canvas which is 
also attached to this report. It should be noted that Epstein 
will contact Palm Beach Police Department with the serial 
number of the stolen handgun so that it may be entered into 
FCIC.

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way 
reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during 
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who 
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53. 
Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he 
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on 
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the 
amount of money in the carry on hag on any specific incident 
and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on 
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a 
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. 
Epstein then placed $4,000. in O.S. currency, one hundred dollar 
bill increments and left the bad on his desk as he always does 
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the 
camera system monitoring the bad and desk area, only to wake up 
and twice to have $100. missingifrom the bag and the suspects 
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there 
were thirteen one hundred dollat bills still in the white envelope 
and that nothing else in the hoUse appeared to be disturbed by the 
suspect. 
Epstein took me to the computerlroom where he showed me a computer 
monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The 
computer indicated a Lime of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into 
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and 
then opened the center drawer td the desk. It appeared as though 
the suspect was familiar with le house and the desk. Epstein 
told me that he did not know wh the suspect in the photo was 
but thought it might be his forMer houseman because of his size 
and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the 
video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman 
The suspect was a white male who

C:1-  advised Epstein that I would

have in hands. Epstein told me 
knowledge of the system but he 
had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. 
Epstein told me he would call wIllen he had more information. 
Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told 
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry 
into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side 
of the house but not the west s de of house because he had 
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. 
It is believed that the suspectlalso left the house by the 
same sliding door that was unlo ked as there were no pry marks 
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed 
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm 
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could 
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this 
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee 
Blvd. to obtain the information 
did due to his back injury. 
was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs 
and a hat. Epstein provided 
information which was Juan P

that he had limited working

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The 
girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage. 
cDri. November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated 
he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he 
was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for 
Epstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private 
plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein 
receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards 
the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi 
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's 
bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage) 
pn January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
Tovember 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
auffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to
or 
one•of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

cool cool. I went with Evelyn to Barnes and 
Noble at midnight. It was nuts, there was so 
many people there. We were like the 5th 
people to get it though. The next s2s show is 
this Thursday actually, but its in Pompano. It 
should be good though. I miss our coffee 
meetings too. We should go sometime this 
week? If you're not busy. Bye.

Thanks for stopping at work to see me. ;) 
I went to the beach again last night with Tony 
Dlaz. The police picked us up though. They 
didn't like us swimming with the sea turtles. 
Juno is a 24 hour beach. We watched the 
sunrise. Beautiful. 
How's your summer?

Hits From the BONG.. 
Lyrics By: Cypress Hill 
Hits from the Bong 
Hits from the Bong 
Hits from the Bong 
Hits from the Bong 
Pick it 
Pack It 
Fire it up, come along 
And take a hit from the bong 
Put the blunt down 
Just for a second 
Don't get me wrong 
It's not a new method 
Inhale 
Exhale 
Just got an ounce in the mail 
I like a blunt or a big fat cone 
But my Double-Barrel Bong 
Is gettin' me stoned 
I'm skill it 
There's water inside don't spill it 
It smells like shit on the carpet 
Still It 
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit 
Of the Skunky, Phunky, Smelly Green Shit 
Sing my song 
Puff all night long 
As I take hits from the Bong 
Hits from the Bong y'all 
Hits from the Bong

Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Let's smoke that bowl 
Hit the Bong 
And then take that finger off of that hole 
Plug it 
Unplug it 
Don't strain 
I love you Mary Jane 
She never complains 
When I hit mary 
With that flame 
I light up the cherry 
She's so good to me 
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen 
Don't get me stirred up 
The smoke, through the bubbling water 
Is makin' it pure so I got to 
Take my hit and hold it 
Just like Chong 
I get the bowl and I reload it 
Get my four-footer and bring it on 
As I take hits from the Bong 
Hlts from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Gonna get high 
Hits from the Bong 
Straighten your Dick out

When you learn to sew you will be ready for 
marriage. It's not hard. I'm sure they have 
womens groups dedicated to teaching all the 
necessary skills for finding a suitable husband.

FISHING TRIP 
A couple goes on vacation to a fishing resort in 
northern Saskatchewan. 
The husband likes to fish at the crack of dawn; 
the wife likes to read. 
One morning the husband returns after several 
hours of fishing and decides to take a nap. 
Although not familiar with the lake, the wife 
decides to take the boat out. She motors out a 
short distance, anchors, and continues to read 
her book.

Along comes a game warden in his boat. He 
pulls up alongside the woman and says, "Good 
morning Ma'am. What are you doing?" 
Reading a book, " she replies, thinking,-'"Isn't 
that obvious?" 
You're In a restricted fishing area, " he informs 
her. 
"I'm sorry officer, but I'm not fishing, I'm 
reading." 
"Yes, but you have all the equipment. For all I 
know you could start at any moment. I'll have 
to take you in and write you up." 
"If you do that, I'll have to charge you with 
sexual assault, " says the woman. 
"But I haven't touched you, " says the game 
warden. 
"That's true, but you have all the equipment. 
For all I know you could start at any moment." 
"Have a nice day ma'am, " and he left.

"/ just want to kiss her on the forehead and tell 
her she's the most beautiful girl in the world" 
right back at you, missy. that, along with the 
rest of what you said, meant a lot to me then, 
and still does. how serendipitous that i found it 
tonight. (it was a crying in the back room 
night.) =\ 
i meant to call you from work, but I'm sam,

Remember when the police had Ian pinned to 
the ground for threatening to slap you? 
Remember when you were crying on the bus 
and you used my jacket sleeve as a tissue? 
Remember when Kurt pulled my chair from 
beneath me and I didn't notice till my ass was 
on the floor? Remember when things weren't 
so difficult, when not everything had an alterior 
motive, when you didn't need to put time aside 
just to relax? 
This is making me feel old.

That reflector should have been attached to 
the ground. And you say you're cursed, any 
other reflector would have been stuck there for 
another hundred years, but you pulled up to 
the one that wasn't. The sky was beautiful that 
night, and so were you.

wait wait wait...remember when you used to 
want a mustang?? lol and then we continually 
called out colors whenever we saw one and i 
convinced you that YOU were not like everyone 
else, why should you drive a car that everyone 
else owned...

you and me 
Remember when we did that thing where you 
called me and said "We'll race!" then we raced 
and you won, technically. And we bought 
matching shirts. Then you lit napkins on fire. 
That was a good day. 
Mar 8, 2005 3:18 PM 
You haven't seen it yet, but still, i saw you 
online and had to post first.... Remember when 
we stayed up for how long watching Season 
one of 24? when you dyed my hair blonde? 
when you used to climb on the counters? when 
you snuck out and left me a note to tell me 
that you had? when we washed our hair in the 
rain at city place? or layed on the stage and 
looked at I Spy books? ohmygoodness we have 
so many... you can remember the harder ones 
though-101 MWAH!

It was nice seeing you at the show today. I 
appreciate the pen and paper. I am sure, that 
sooner or later, what I began writing on your 
clinic pass, may become something catchy, 
and altogether worth hearing.

I hope that by now you have learned to cook, 
clean, and sew. If not then you are disobeying 
a direct order from a man, and shll face 
punishment. As an inferior woman, this could 
Include death, or even imprisonment. I hope 
that you respond in a postive way. Later.
