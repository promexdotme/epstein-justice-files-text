Re: 
Teresa Helm v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10476-PGG-DCF 
 
 
 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We submit on behalf of Plaintiff Teresa Helm this reply in further support of her letter 
motion for a conference to address Defendants’ failure to comply with their discovery obligations 
(ECF No. 37), and in response to Defendants’ second letter in opposition, filed on May 13, 2020 
(ECF No. 43).  As an initial matter, the Court should disregard Defendants’ latest response as 
untimely.  Pursuant to Individual Rule 1.D., “[u]nless the Court orders otherwise, opposition to 
any letter motion shall be filed within three (3) days of the moving letter.”  Notwithstanding this 
rule, Defendants filed an incomplete and non-substantive opposition on May 8, and requested 
“permission to submit a response to the substantive issues raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020.”  
ECF No. 38.  Defendants’ letter did not comply with Individual Rule 1.B., which governs “requests 
for adjournments or extensions of time.”  In any event, the Court did not issue an order extending 
Defendants’ time to respond, much less grant Defendants leave to file two oppositions as opposed 
to one.  But even if the Court were to consider Defendants’ untimely filing, each of their arguments 
is meritless, and confirms the need for immediate Court intervention to resolve the parties’ disputes.   
First, Defendants refuse to engage in discovery for more than a narrow, less than one-year 
period in 2002.  This is improper, as information concerning Epstein’s abuse of other girls and 
young women throughout the span of his sex-trafficking conspiracy is plainly relevant, and 
therefore discoverable under Rule 26.  Defendants deride Plaintiff’s allegations as a “sex 
trafficking scheme–which,” according to Defendants, “is based on unproven allegations in the 
S.D.N.Y.’s 2019 indictment of Mr. Epstein.”  ECF No. 43 at 2 (emphases added).  But given all 
that has been discovered about the scope of Epstein’s operations and the numerous ways in which 
Plaintiff’s abuse mirrored Epstein’s abuse of others, Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff “does not 
need discovery about Mr. Epstein’s interactions with other individuals” is baseless.  As set forth 
in Plaintiff’s opening letter, “[d]ocuments relating to the sexual trafficking and/or sexual assault 
of others at any point during that period would make the fact that Epstein trafficked and sexually 
assaulted Plaintiff, the key fact that Plaintiff bears the burden of proving in this case, more probable 
than it would be without such evidence.”  ECF No. 37 at 2.  Moreover, Rule 415 (which Defendants 
fail to address) unambiguously provides that “[i]n a civil case involving a claim for relief based on 
a party’s alleged sexual assault or child molestation, the court may admit evidence that the party

committed any other sexual assault or child molestation.”  Fed. R. Evid. 415.  Defendants are free 
to attempt to prove Epstein innocent, and can try to prove that the allegations set forth in Plaintiff’s 
complaint and the S.D.N.Y.’s indictment are false.  They cannot, however, prevent Plaintiff from 
accessing the information that would prove otherwise. 
 
Defendants argue that allowing discovery into a period of time greater than a few months 
is somehow “not proportional to the needs of this case and would impose an undue burden on the 
Co-Executors.”  ECF No. 43 at 1.  But “unsubstantiated claims of undue burden, overbreadth and 
lack of relevancy” in situations where a party has “produced no documents and answered no 
interrogatories . . . are a paradigm of discovery abuse.”  Jacoby v. Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 
254 F.R.D. 477, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  Defendants do not even attempt to quantify what the burden 
of reviewing documents through the present would be, or how that number would compare to that 
for the time period they propose.  The only information Defendants offer in their letter is a 
representation that they are “reviewing a database of over 730,000 documents.”  ECF No. 43 at 1 
(emphasis in original).  That representation is ambiguous, however, as it sheds no light on (i) how 
many of those documents Defendants will review (as opposed to just being a number of documents 
housed on a “database”); (ii) how those documents were collected; or (iii) whether any of those 
documents are currently being reviewed in response to the discovery requests Plaintiff served in 
this case (as opposed to those served in cases brought by other victims).  And the fact that Epstein’s 
Estate is “large and complicated” does not change Defendants’ discovery obligations or the 
deadlines that this Court imposed.  Absent any particularized showing that compliance with 
Plaintiff’s discovery requests would pose an undue burden, Defendants’ proposal to limit the 
discovery period to less than a year is unfounded. Again, to date Defendants have not produced a 
single document—not one.                      
Second, Defendants improperly refuse to answer interrogatories or produce documents that 
do not specifically reference Plaintiff or the specific instances in which she was abused.  
Defendants claim that they “have and will continue to search for and produce documents that relate 
to Plaintiff and her claims of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of 
whether they specifically reference Plaintiff.”  ECF No. 43 at 3.  As set forth above, however, 
Plaintiff is entitled to information concerning Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy as a whole, 
including his abuse of others, his communications with his co-conspirators, and the various ways 
in which he operated his scheme throughout the years.  Because the parties’ disagreement hinges 
on whether or not defined topics are discoverable under Rule 26, Defendants’ suggestion that the 
dispute can be resolved by exchanging “bilateral search-term proposals” is disingenuous at best.1  
Id. at 3.  Court intervention is required now so that Defendants can begin reviewing and producing 
documents concerning the sex-trafficking conspiracy they are trying to keep secret.                     
Third, the Court should compel Defendants to answer Plaintiff’s interrogatories in full.  In 
a desperate attempt to convince the Court that this issue is somehow “moot” or that Plaintiff’s 
pre-motion letter was “premature,” Defendants claim that Plaintiff’s request was merely “that Co-
                                                        
1 Plaintiff already offered to provide a list of search terms to Defendants, and their counsel 
responded by stating that Defendants would only consider any other names Plaintiff goes by as 
search terms.  If that was not Defendants’ position, they never corrected it or otherwise indicated 
that they would change it.

Executors supplement their interrogatory responses.”  ECF No. 43 at 3.  To be clear, Plaintiff’s 
anticipated motion will be to compel Defendants to respond meaningfully to all of Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories, which has still not happened despite Defendants’ belated “supplementation.”  
Defendants’ “supplemental responses,” attached hereto as Exhibit A, remain deficient, and only 
insert cosmetic changes based on information that should have been obvious to Defendants at the 
time they served their “initial” responses, 2 or parrot back information taken from Plaintiff’s 
complaint and Plaintiff’s own production of documents.  In any event, each of Defendants’ 
“supplemental” responses “is limited to the Relevant Time Period,” which means that Defendants 
still refuse to answer Plaintiff’s interrogatories for more than a one year period.  Court 
intervention is required to compel Defendants to answer these interrogatories in full.     
Finally, although irrelevant to the pending motion concerning Defendants’ discovery 
efforts, Plaintiff has fully complied with her discovery obligations to date, and will continue to do 
so.  Defendants complain that Plaintiff included within her productions what they claim are 
“irrelevant documents from another case,” ECF No. 43 at 4, but Plaintiff produced these 
documents because Defendants specifically asked for the documents identified in Plaintiff’s initial 
disclosures, and Plaintiff correctly produced those documents.  Plaintiff has and will continue to 
engage with opposing counsel in good faith to answer any questions they may have.3                                
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her request 
for a conference.   
  
 
 
                                                        
2 Together with their “supplemental responses,” Defendants’ served verifications for their “initial 
responses” on May 13, 2020.  Ex. B.  Whereas the initial responses were served on April 16, the 
signatures for the verifications for those responses are dated May 12, 2020, which is the same date 
as the verifications for the supplemental responses.     
3 In a footnote, Defendants mention a ruling in Giuffre v. Dershowitz, which disqualified Boies 
Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) as counsel for another Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre, in a 
defamation case brought by that victim against Alan Dershowitz.  Giuffre v. Dershowitz, 410 F. 
Supp. 3d 564, 578-79 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Judge Preska’s disqualification of the law firm was not a 
sanction.  Instead, it was based on the advocate-witness rule because Dershowitz claimed that a 
BSF attorney (while representing the victim) said something to him during a settlement negotiation 
that would implicate the truth or falsity of one of Dershowitz’s allegedly defamatory statements.  
Id. at 579. Indeed, BSF continues to represent Virginia Giuffre before Judge Preska in the Giuffre 
v. Maxwell matter.  Defendants disingenuously state that “[t]he Court should be aware” of that 
ruling, despite the fact that it has nothing to do with whether or not Plaintiff herself was a victim 
of Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy.  If Defendants and their counsel are actually seeking to 
prove Epstein innocent or otherwise insulated from accounting for his misconduct, they should 
drop their baseless objections to discovery, stop ad hominem attacks on counsel, cease their delay 
tactics, and welcome a trial on the merits.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
TERESA HELM, 
Plaintiff,  
                       v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN 
in their capacities as the executors of the ESTATE  
OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.  
 
 
    Case No. 1:19-cv-10476-PGG-DCF 
 
 
DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF 
TERESA HELM’S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS 
 
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), by their attorneys, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
26 and 33, provide the following supplemental responses to Plaintiff Teresa Helm’s (“Plaintiff”) 
First Set of Interrogatories to Defendants (the “Interrogatories”).  
RESERVATION OF RIGHTS 
 
These supplemental responses are made solely for the purpose of and in relation to 
discovery in the above-captioned action.  The Co-Executors submit these supplemental responses 
subject to, and without intending to waive, and expressly preserving:  (i) any objections as to 
relevancy, materiality, competency, privilege and admissibility of any documents and information 
produced in discovery, including without limitation herein; and (ii) the right to object to any other 
discovery requests.  The Co-Executors have been placed in charge of a large and complex estate 
and are working to determine the existence of responsive information concerning the affairs of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Decedent”) and those efforts are continuing. Much of the requested 
information is outside of their knowledge, possession or control.  To the extent non privileged

responsive information would be available to them at all, access to such information has been 
severely hampered by the current pandemic.  Accordingly, Co-Executors reserve their right to 
amend or further supplement these responses if and when appropriate.  Further, these supplemental 
responses are neither an admission nor acceptance of any alleged facts, including without 
limitation those stated in the Interrogatories. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS  
The Co-Executors incorporate their initial objections to the definitions and instructions as 
if stated fully herein. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO 
INTERROGATORIES 
INTERROGATORY NO. 1 
 
List the names and addresses of all persons who are believed or known by You, Your 
agents, or Your attorneys to have any knowledge concerning any of the issues in this lawsuit, and 
specify the subject matter about which the witness has knowledge. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors also object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither 
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and 
unduly burdensome.   
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors identify the 
following individual who has knowledge concerning the battery and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress allegedly committed by Decedent against Plaintiff:  Plaintiff. 
In addition, in her Complaint, Plaintiff identifies the following individuals with whom she

42245383v6  
alleges she interacted with or communicated with:  Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Kellen, and the 
unidentified fellow massage therapy student described in paragraph 36 of the Complaint.  Co-
Executors do not know whether these individuals ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff, or 
have knowledge concerning Plaintiff’s claims. 
In addition, the Co-Executors identify the following individuals, believed to have worked 
at Decedent’s home in New York, which is the only place where Plaintiff alleges she encountered 
Decedent, during the period from June 1, 2002, to December 31, 2002, which based upon the 
allegations of the Complaint, appears to cover the entire time period during which Plaintiff’s 
claims could have accrued (the “Relevant Time Period”):  Luciano Fontanilla, Rosalyn Fontanilla, 
Richard Barnett, Ghislaine Maxwell and Adam Perry Lang.  Co-Executors do not know whether 
these individuals ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff, or have knowledge concerning 
Plaintiff’s allegations. 
To the extent additional individuals are identified in response to other interrogatories, those 
individuals may, but not necessarily, have such knowledge.  The Co-Executors’ search for relevant 
information remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any additional 
responsive information is ascertained.  
INTERROGATORY NO. 2 
 
Identify all email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:  
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 2 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
Case 1:19-cv-10476-PGG-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 4 of 14

42245383v6  
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state that it is 
their understanding that the email addresses listed below were created for or on behalf of Decedent, 
but only jeevacation@gmail.com and jeeproject@yahoo.com were actively used by Decedent 
himself.  Moreover, Co-Executors currently do not believe that jeevacation@gmail.com existed or 
was in use during the Relevant Time Period and do not know whether jeeproject@yahoo.com was 
in use during the Relevant Time Period: 
• columbiadental1@yahoo.com 
• jeevacation@me.com 
• jeevacation1@me.com 
• jeeproject@yahoo.com 
• jeevacation@gmail.com 
• jeffrey@jeffreyepstein.org 
• jeffreyepsteinorg@gmail.com 
• jeffreyepsteinorg@yahoo.com 
• jeffreyepstein@live.com 
• jeeitunes@gmail.com 
• littlestjeff@yahoo.com 
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 3 
 
Identify all telephone numbers used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents acting 
on his behalf, including beepers, Blackberry or PDA devices, cellular phones and land lines in any 
of his residences, by stating the users name, complete telephone number(s), type of device and 
name of the service provider. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 3 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on

the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state that it is 
their understanding that the following phone numbers were used by Decedent or registered to 
properties where Decedent stayed at different times, but are unaware of the specific time period 
that the numbers were in use:

The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 4 
 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and locations of 
employment, who performed work or services in or on any property owned, leased, occupied, or 
used by Epstein, including but not limited Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach, Florida, New York 
City, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, London and Paris, and provide the name and contact 
information of the individual who hired, trained and supervised each employee. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 4 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to those individuals who are believed to have worked during the Relevant Time 
Period at Decedent’s home in New York, which is the only place where Plaintiff alleges she 
encountered Decedent.   Co-Executors do not know whether these individuals ever spoke with or 
interacted with Plaintiff during the Relevant Time Period.

Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors identify the 
following individuals: Luciano Fontanilla, Rosalyn Fontanilla, Richard Barnett, Ghislaine 
Maxwell and Adam Perry Lang. 
 
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 5 
 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and location of 
employment, who performed work as an assistant, scheduler, secretary, masseuse or traveling 
masseuse for Epstein and provide the name and contact information of the individual who hired, 
trained and supervised each employee. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 5 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the terms “scheduler” and “traveling masseuse” are vague and ambiguous.  The Co-
Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is 
unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time 
Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors identify Lesley 
Groff and Sarah Kellen, who were Decedent’s assistants during a portion of the Relevant Time 
Period.  Co-Executors do not know whether Ms. Groff or Ms. Kellen ever spoke with or interacted 
with Plaintiff.  Co-Executors also refer Plaintiff to the documents produced by Plaintiff at Bates 
Nos. THELM 3736-3832, which purports to list contact information for masseuses.  Co-Executors

relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any 
additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 6 
 
Identify all companies and/or persons who provided transportation services to Epstein, 
whether as an employee or independent contractor, including without limitation drivers, 
chauffeurs, boat captains, pilots, and aircraft crew, and provide the contact information for each 
listed person or company. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 6 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case, as Plaintiff 
does not allege that she traveled anywhere with Decedent; it is also overly broad and unduly 
burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the grounds that the phrase 
“transportation services” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors further object to this 
Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-
Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors identify Shoppers 
Travel, Inc., which is a travel agency that provided travel-related services to Decedent at certain 
times, although Co-Executors do not know if services were provided by Shoppers Travel, Inc. 
during the Relevant Time Period.   
INTERROGATORY NO. 7 
Identify all females by name and age for whom Epstein or his employees or agents provided 
accommodations at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York for any period of time. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 7 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also

overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the phrase “provided accommodations” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors 
further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.   
Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state the 
following individuals stayed at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York for some period of time, 
but it is unknown whether any of them stayed at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York during 
the Relevant Time Period: 
• Roslyn Fontanilla 
• Susan Hamblin 
• Sarah Kellen 
 
Co-Executors do not know whether the individuals listed have ever spoke with or interacted 
with Plaintiff during the Relevant Time Period.  The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information 
remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any additional responsive 
information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 8 
 
Identify by name and age all persons who gave a massage or were asked to give a massage 
to Epstein, Maxwell or a guest, or to whom Epstein or Maxwell gave a massage, at any of Epstein’s 
residences and provide the location of each massage. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 8 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors further object on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither relevant to 
Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and unduly

burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent 
that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant 
Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors refer Plaintiff to 
the documents produced by Plaintiff at Bates Nos. THELM 3736-3832, which purports to list 
contact information for masseuses.  Co-Executors do not know whether any individuals identified 
therein are masseuses or if those individuals provided massages to Decedent during the Relevant 
Time Period. The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will 
supplement this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 9 
 
Identify any telecommunications, information technology, or audio-visual technology 
company that Epstein hired for work in any of his residences or offices and provide the name and 
contact information for each individual or company listed, in addition to the residence or office 
serviced. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 12 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the phrase “hired for work” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors further object 
to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, 
Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors believe that 
Mark Lundberg may have performed information technology work in some or all of Decedent’s 
homes during the Relevant Time Period.
