Defendants Darren K.Indyke and Richard D.Kahn,Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey
E.Epstein (incorrectlynamed herein as “Joint Personal Representatives”of the Estate of Jeffrey
E.Epstein),Nine East 71st Street,Corporation,Financial Trust Company,Inc.,and NES,LLC
(together,“Defendants”),bytheir attorneys,submit this memorandum of law in response to
Plaintiff’s Motion For Leave To Proceed Anonymously(the Motion)(ECF #4):
ARGUMENT
Defendants do not object to Plaintiff proceeding under a pseudonym to prevent the
disclosure of her identityto the general public.However,this response is necessaryfor two
separate reasons.
First,Plaintiff’s Motion asserts numerous unproven statements,couched as facts already
in evidence,as well as conclusions of law.Defendants object to these unproven and conclusory
assertions.In anyevent,the Court does not need to consider suchassertions to resolve Plaintiff’s
Motion.
Second,it is imperative that Plaintiff’s desire to shield her identityfrom the general
public not come at the expense of Defendants’fundamental right to fullyand fairlyrespond to
Plaintiff’s allegations in her Complaint.Therefore,Defendants respectfullyrequest that the
Court resolve Plaintiff’s Motion byentering the proposed order annexed hereto as Exhibit A (the
“Proposed Order”).The Proposed Order would protect Plaintiff’s identityfrom public disclosure
while enabling Defendants to fullyrespond to the Complaint withminimal prejudice. The
Proposed Order would also permit the parties to seekto modifyit as necessaryto meet the needs
of this case as it evolves.1
The Proposed Order accords withwell-established Second Circuit law because it
1Should this matter proceed to discovery,the Parties would be able to address discovery issues implicated by
Plaintiff’s desire to proceed anonymously in a separate discovery order that otherwise addresses general
confidentialityconcerns.

balances Plaintiff’s legitimate desire to maintain confidentialitywithDefendants’right to fully
defend themselves in this action.See Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant,537F3d 185,189(2d
Cir.2008)(“W e agree that the interests of boththe public and the opposing partyshould be
considered when determining whether to grant an application to proceed under a pseudonym.”);
Doe v. Skyline Automobiles Inc.,375F Supp 3d 401,407(S.D.N.Y.2019)(“Allowing Plaintiff
[alleging sexual assault,harassment,and discrimination]to proceed anonymouslywould
disadvantage Defendants at all stages of litigation,including settlement,discovery,and trial.
Plaintiff's anonymitywould make it more difficult to obtain witnesses and witness testimony,
Defendants would have less leverage in settlement negotiations,and Defendants would not be
able to fullyand adequatelycross-examine the Plaintiff.”);Doe I v. Four Bros. Pizza, Inc.,13-
CV-1505VB,2013W L6083414,at *31(S.D.N.Y.Nov.19,2013)(“Significantly,it will not be
feasible for the parties to proceed withdiscoveryin a meaningful waywhile plaintiffs remain
anonymous.”).
The Proposed Order is also consistent withPlaintiff’s positions in her Motion.The
Motion provides that Plaintiff’s counsel “will cooperate withthe court and the Defendants and
reveal Plaintiff’s true identityto defendants for discoverypurposes on the condition that
Defendants do not disclose Plaintiff’s name to the general public.” (ECF #4-1at p.7).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing,Defendants respectfullyrequest that the Court enter the Proposed
Order and grant Defendants suchother and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
