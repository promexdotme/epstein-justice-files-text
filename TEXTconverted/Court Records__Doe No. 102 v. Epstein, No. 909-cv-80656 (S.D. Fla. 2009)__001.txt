STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, was an adult male, spanning the 
ages of 45 and 55 years old. Epstein is known as a billionaire financier and money manager with 
a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power, 
and influence. He owns a fleet of aircraft that includes a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a 
Boeing 727, as well as a fleet of motor vehicles. Until his incarceration, he maintained his 
principal place of residence in the largest home in Manhattan, a 51,000-square-foot eight-story 
mansion on the Upper East Side. Upon information and belief, he also owns a $6.8 million 
mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a $30 million 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico he named 
"Zorro," a 70-acre private island known as Little St. James in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, a 
mansion in London's Westminster neighborhood, and a home in the Avenue Foch area of Paris. 
The allegations herein concern Defendant's conduct while at his lavish homes and/or numerous 
other locations both nationally and internationally. 
9. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant has a sexual preference for underage 
minor girls. He engaged in a plan, scheme, or enterprise in which he gained access to countless 
vulnerable and relatively economically disadvantaged minor girls, and sexually assaulted, 
molested, and/or exploited these girls, and then gave them money. 
10. 
Beginning in or around 1998 through in or around September 2007, Defendant 
used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor girls to engage in a systematic pattern 
of sexually exploitative behavior.

11. 
Defendant's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. 
Defendant coerced and enticed impressionable, vulnerable, and relatively economically less 
fortunate minor girls to participate in various acts of sexual misconduct that he committed upon 
them. Defendant's scheme involved the use of underage girls, as well as other individuals, to 
recruit other underage girls. Upon information and belief, Defendant and/or an authorized agent 
would call and alert Defendant's assistants shortly before or after he arrived at his Palm Beach 
residence. His assistants would call economically disadvantaged and underage girls from West 
Palm Beach and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered and who 
Defendant and/or his assistants perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have 
credibility issues if allegations of improper conduct were made. The then minor Plaintiff and 
other minor girls, some as young as 12 years old, were transported to Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion by Defendant's employees, agents, and/or assistants in order to provide Defendant with 
"massages." 
12. 
Many of the instances of illegal sexual conduct committed by Defendant were 
perpetrated with the assistance, support, and facilitation of at least three assistants who helped 
him orchestrate this child exploitation enterprise. These assistants would often arrange times for 
underage girls to come to Defendant's residence, transport or cause the transportation of 
underage girls to Defendant's residence, escort the underage girls to the massage room where 
Defendant would be waiting or would enter shortly thereafter, urge the underage girls to remove 
their clothes, deliver cash from Defendant to the underage girls and/or their procurers at the 
conclusion of each "massage appointment," and, upon information and belief, take nude 
photographs and/or videos of the underage girls for Defendant with and/or without their 
knowledge. Defendant would pay the procurer of each girl's "appointment" hundreds of dollars.

13. 
Epstein designed this scheme to secure a private place in Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion where only persons employed and invited by Epstein would be present, so as to reduce 
the chance of detection of Defendant's sexual abuse and prostitution as well as to make it more 
difficult for the minor girls to flee the premises and/or to credibly report his actions to law 
enforcement or other authorities. The girls were usually transported by his employees, agents, 
and/or assistants or by a taxicab paid for by Defendant in order to make it difficult for the girls to 
flee his mansion. 
14. 
Upon arrival at Defendant's Palm Beach mansion, each underage victim would 
generally be introduced to one of Defendant's assistants, who would gather the girl's personal 
contact information. The minor girl would then be led up a flight of stairs to a room that 
contained a massage table and a large shower. The staircase leading to the room was plastered 
with nude photographs of young girls, including some photographs depicting two or more young 
girls engaged in lewd acts. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, had such 
photographs in each of his six homes and/or on his computers. 
15. 
At times, if it was the girl's first "massage" appointment, another female would 
be in the room to "lead the way" until Defendant would have her leave. Generally, Defendant 
would start his massage wearing only a small towel, which eventually would be removed. 
Defendant and/or the other female would direct the girl to massage him, giving the minor girl 
specific instructions as to where and how he wanted to be touched, and then direct her to remove 
her clothing. He would then perform one or more lewd, lascivious, and sexual acts, including 
masturbation, fondling the minor's breasts and/or sexual organs, touching the minor's vulva, 
vagina, and/or anus with a vibrator and/or back massager and/or his finger(s) and/or his penis, 
digitally penetrating her vagina, performing intercourse, oral sex, and/or anal sex, and/or 
coercing or attempting to coerce the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or prostitution and/or

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 5 of 27
enticing the then mmor girl to engage in sexual acts with another female in Defendant's 
presence. The exact degree of molestation and frequency with which the sexual exploitations 
took place varied and is not yet completely known; however, Defendant committed such acts 
regularly on a daily basis and, in most instances, several times a day. In order to facilitate the 
daily exchanges of money for sexual assault and abuse, Defendant kept U.S. currency readily 
available. 
16. 
Defendant, Epstein, traveled to his mansion in Palm Beach for the purpose of 
luring minor girls to his mansion to sexually abuse and/or batter them. He used the telephone to 
contact these minor girls for the purpose of coercing them into acts of prostitution and to enable 
himself to commit sexual battery against them and/or acts of lewdness in their presence, and he 
conspired with others, including assistants and/or his driver(s) and/or pilot(s), and his socialite 
friend/partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, to further these acts and to avoid police detection. 
Defendant's systematic pattern of sexually exploitative behavior referred to in paragraph 10 and 
described in paragraphs 11 through the present paragraph occurred in all of Defendant's 
domestic and international residences and/or places of lodging and/or modes of transportation. 
17. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Defendant used his money, 
wealth, and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then minor Plaintiff. 
A vulnerable young girl, Plaintiff was working as a changing room assistant at The Mar-A-Lago 
Club in Palm Beach making approximately $9 an hour when she was first lured into Defendant's 
sexually exploitative world. In or about the summer of 1998, when Plaintiff was merely fifteen 
years old while attending to her duties at Mar-A-Lago, Plaintiff was recruited by Ghislaine 
Maxwell, who lived, traveled, socialized, and worked with Defendant. Ms. Maxwell asked 
Plaintiff if she was interested in learning massage therapy and earning a great deal of money 
while learning the profession. Plaintiffs father, who was a maintenance manager at The Mar-A-

Lago Club, was not apprehensive because he felt comforted that an older woman had approached 
Plaintiff with this opportunity. As a result, Plaintiffs father dropped off Plaintiff at Defendant's 
mansion that same day. Ms. Maxwell met Plaintiff and her father outside of Defendant's Palm 
Beach mansion, where Ms. Maxwell assured the minor girl's father that Ms. Maxwell would 
provide transportation home for his teenaged daughter. Ghislaine Maxwell led Plaintiff up a 
flight of stairs to a spa room with a shower and a massage table. Defendant was lying naked on 
the massage table. Plaintiff was shocked, but, with no experience with massages, thought this 
could be massage therapy protocol. Ms. Maxwell then took off her own shirt and left on her 
underwear and started rubbing her breasts across Defendant's body, impliedly showing Plaintiff 
what she was expected to do. Ms. Maxwell then told Plaintiff to take off her clothes. The minor 
girl was apprehensive about doing this, but, in fear, proceeded to follow Ms. Maxwell by 
removing everything but her underwear. She was then ordered to remove her underwear and to 
straddle Defendant. 
The encounter escalated, with Defendant and Ms. Maxwell sexually 
assaulting, battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff in various ways and in various locations, 
including the steam room and shower. At the end of this sexually exploitive abuse, Defendant 
and Ms. Maxwell giddily told Plaintiff to return the following day and told her she had "lots of 
potential." Defendant paid Plaintiff hundreds of dollars, told her it was for two hours of work, 
and directed one of his employees to drive her home. 
18. 
Defendant and/or his procurers thereafter lured the then minor Plaintiff to his 
Palm Beach mansion every day for the next two weeks in order to engage in a similar pattern of 
sexual exploitation. Defendant and/or his procurers arranged at the end of each incident the 
transportation and scheduling for the following day's appointment. Additionally, Defendant 
telephoned the minor Plaintiff himself and/or had Ms. Maxwell telephone Plaintiff to make 
arrangements. 
Plaintiff was often times driven to and from Epstein's mansion by Epstein

Podhurst Orseck, P.A. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 7 of 27
himself or his driver. Alternatively, Defendant or Ms. Maxwell would arrange and pay for 
Plaintiffs transportation home by taxicab. 
19. 
During Plaintiffs second incident of being sexually exploited and assaulted by 
Defendant at Defendant's Palm Beach mansion, Defendant asked Plaintiff to quit her job at The 
Mar-A-Lago Club and travel with him to earn much more money while learning the massage 
profession. Thus, Plaintiff, an impressionable and vulnerable young girl of modest means, quit 
her job as a changing room assistant, was lured by Defendant, and continued to be victimized by 
Defendant, who immersed the minor Plaintiff into Defendant's lewd and abusive lifestyle. 
Under Defendant's dominion and control, Defendant continuously "groomed" the minor 
adolescent. 
Defendant's daily routine required the minor Plaintiff to perform sexually on 
Defendant multiple times per day and to provide Defendant massages multiple times per day. 
Plaintiff had absolutely no say as to when, how many times, or what was done during each 
sexual encounter. Often, Plaintiff was joined by Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell's assistant, and/or a 
countless array of young women who would be brought to one of Defendant's homes for the 
sexual trysts and then be sexually exploited by Defendant. 
20. 
The first time that Defendant transported Plaintiff to another state in order to 
engage in sexual acts with her occurred when she was merely fifteen years old and after only two 
weeks of daily sexually abusive encounters with Defendant. Defendant used his private jet to 
transport the minor Plaintiff to Manhattan, where he provided her with spending money and 
accommodations with him at his mansion. 
From the time that Plaintiff was 15 years old, 
Defendant abused her to serve his every sexual whim, obtaining and purchasing passports and 
whatever was needed for her to travel with him and/or for him. Defendant transported Plaintiff 
in his private jet to locations that included Palm Beach, New York City, Santa Fe, Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, St. Louis, and numerous other domestic destinations, as well as international

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 8 of 27
destinations, including Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa. He provided accommodations with 
him in order to have her available to him at all times wherever he went, including while 
transporting the minor Plaintiff on his private jet. Each time they would travel to one of these 
destinations, the same pattern of sexual abuse would occur, often with a vast array of aspiring 
models, actresses, celebrities, and/or other females, including minors, from all over the world. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant transported minor girls from Turkey, the Czech 
Republic, Asia, and numerous other countries, many of whom spoke no English. To Plaintiffs 
knowledge, the only females specifically excluded from Defendant's sexual escapades were 
African-Americans. 
21. 
In addition to being continually exploited to satisfy Defendant's every sexual 
whim, Plaintiff was also required to be sexually exploited by Defendant's adult male peers, 
including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal 
acquaintances. Whenever Defendant transported Plaintiff with him in his private jet to any 
destination, Defendant would pay Plaintiff a flat rate per day while he and/or his above-
mentioned associates would sexually exploit and abuse minor Plaintiff. 
22. 
Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when Defendant knew that 
Plaintiff was approximately 15, 16, and 17 years old, and, after years of daily sexual exploitation, 
continued into her adulthood. Despite Defendant's stating shortly before Plaintiffs sixteenth 
birthday that he soon would have to trade her in because she was getting too old, Defendant 
continued to sexually exploit Plaintiff until she fled at age 19. Defendant's predilection for 
young girls was well known to those who regularly procured them for him and to his circle of 
friends. On one of Defendant's birthdays, a friend of Defendant sent him three 12-year-old girls 
from France who spoke no English for Defendant to sexually exploit and abuse. After doing so, 
they were sent back to France the next day.

23. 
Any assertions by Defendant that he was unaware of the age of the then minor 
Plaintiff are belied by his own actions, and are rendered irrelevant by the provision of applicable 
federal statutes concerning the sexual exploitation and abuse of a minor child. Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, at all times material to this cause of action, knew and should have known of 
Plaintiffs age of minority. Defendant and Ms. Maxwell acknowledged and celebrated Plaintiffs 
16th birthday. Defendant's preference for underage girls was well-known to those who regularly 
procured them for him. 
24. 
As previously stated in paragraph 14, Defendant displayed nude photographs of 
underage girls throughout his homes in New York City, Palm Beach, Santa Fe, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, saw photographs of naked young girls in each of 
Defendant's homes, including a photograph of herself naked at Defendant's home in Palm 
Beach. When she asked Defendant about it, he stated dismissively that he had naked photographs 
of her in all of his homes. 
25. 
Upon information and belief, some of the photographs in Defendant's possession 
were taken with hidden cameras set up in his home in Palm Beach. On the day of his arrest, 
police found two hidden cameras and photographs of underage girls on a computer in 
Defendant's home. Upon information and belief, Defendant may have taken lewd photographs 
of Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, with his hidden cameras and may have transported lewd 
photographs of Plaintiff ( among many other victims) to his other residences and elsewhere using 
a facility or means of interstate and/or foreign commerce. In addition, while Plaintiff was a 
minor teenager and upon Ms. Maxwell's insistence after Ms. Maxwell rejected as inappropriate 
photographs that Plaintiff presented of herself fully clothed, Ms. Maxwell photographed Plaintiff 
naked in different sexually explicit positions. 
Ms. Maxwell then presented these nude 
photographs of Plaintiff to Defendant as a birthday present for Defendant from Ms. Maxwell.

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 10 of 27
Upon information and belief, one or more nude photographs of Plaintiff that were taken when 
she was a minor were confiscated by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office during its execution of a 
search warrant of Defendant's Palm Beach mansion on October 20, 2005. Upon information 
and belief, those photographs are still in the custody of law enforcement. 
26. 
It is virtually impossible to calculate the exact number of times that Defendant 
sexually exploited and abused Plaintiff. From the age of 15, Plaintiff was sexually exploited and 
abused by Defendant on a daily basis and, most often, multiple times each day. While some of 
the precise dates these acts occurred are unknown to Plaintiff, these dates are known to 
Defendant, as he is reported to have kept a written log of each instance in which he engaged in 
these lewd acts with then minor Plaintiff and others. Upon information and belief, these logs are 
also in the custody of law enforcement. 
27. 
In or around September 2002, Defendant purchased a commercial round-trip 
airline ticket, and provided a passport, U.S. currency, and accommodations for Plaintiff to fly to 
Thailand. While thousands of miles away from Defendant on this extended trip alone for the 
first time in more than four years, Plaintiff met, fell in love, and married a young man. She 
escaped from Defendant's abuse with the help and insistence of her new husband and, instead of 
returning to Defendant, boarded a plane to Australia with one suitcase. 
28. 
Since November 2002, Plaintiff has lived a modest life in Australia, while 
maintaining lines of communication with her family and without contact with Defendant or any 
of the people in his entourage. However, suddenly, in 2008, Plaintiff received numerous phone 
calls from one of Defendant's agents. During these phone calls to Plaintiff, he repeatedly asked 
whether she knew anything about the civil cases against Defendant, whether she knew any of the 
females who were proceeding with the civil suits, whether she was planning on filing suit, 
whether she was communicating and/or cooperating with anyone against Defendant, and whether 
Podhurst Orseck, P.A. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 11 of 27
she would return to the United States to testify. Terrified by Defendant's demonstrated ability to 
track her down on her changed cell phone number halfway across the world, Plaintiff attempted 
to reassure Defendant's agent that she would remain quiet. During the course of one of these 
phone calls from Defendant's agents, Defendant himself spoke on the phone, continued to 
question her intentions, and, upon being reassured by Plaintiff, thanked her for not getting 
involved. 
29. 
Around January 2009, Plaintiff received a letter from the United States Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida, informing her of her potential civil claims against 
Defendant under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Plaintiff contacted undersigned counsel within days and 
diligently and repeatedly pursued a good faith viable settlement of her claims against Defendant. 
Unable to reach a settlement, this lawsuit followed. 
30. 
As a result of these encounters with Defendant, Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, has in 
the past suffered, and will in the future continue to suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, 
emotional distress, psychological and/or psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, 
confusion, embarrassment, loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, 
invasion of her privacy, separation from her family, and other damages associated with 
Defendant's controlling and manipulating her on a daily basis for years into a perverse and 
unhealthy way of life. 
31. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, committed the above-referenced acts upon Plaintiff in 
violation of federal statutes condemning the coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in 
prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex 
trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor children, transport of visual depictions of a 
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, transport of child pornography, child exploitation 
enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those crimes designated

In June 2008, after investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department, the Palm 
Beach State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, entered pleas 
of "guilty" to various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and 
the procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in 
Palm Beach County, Florida. Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is in the same position as if he had 
been tried and convicted of the sexual offenses committed against Plaintiff and, as such, must 
admit liability unto Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102. Plaintiff hereby exclusively seeks civil remedies
