Re: 
Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as 
the Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors 
of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. 
We write pursuant to Your Honor’s Individual Practices § (III)(B) to request approval to 
file the Co-Executors’ Statement on Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed Anonymously 
(“Statement”) with redactions to ensure Plaintiff’s identity is not made public pending the 
Court’s determination of her Application (ECF No. 29) (the “Application”). The unredacted 
and redacted versions of the Statement and accompanying Declaration of Bennet J. 
Moskowitz1 are being filed under seal and publicly, respectively, contemporaneously 
herewith in accordance with Individual Practices § (III)(B).  
As a matter of context, on March 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed her complaint under the 
pseudonym “Jane Doe.” (ECF No. 1.) On July 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed the Application, 
requesting approval to prosecute this lawsuit pseudonymously. The Co-Executors have 
never sought to prevent any alleged victim of Mr. Epstein from proceeding under a 
pseudonym—and they do not do so here. However, in this unique situation, the Co-
Executors have determined that it is appropriate to bring to the Court’s attention material 
facts not contained in Plaintiff’s Application so that the Court may rule on it with the benefit 
of all relevant information and case law.  
1 The exhibits to the Declaration are filed entirely under seal.
