AFFIDAVIT 
I, Christina J. Pryor, being duly sworn, do state and attest as follows: 
1. 
I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (FBI) and have 
been so employed for three (3) months. I am currently assigned to the Safe Streets Task 
Force, Miami Field Division, FBI Squad PB-2. Prior to joining the Miami Field Division, 
I attended the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, for five (5) months where I received 
training in federal criminal laws and investigation techniques, including the laws related to 
obstruction of justice. 
2. 
This affidavit is based upon my own personal knowledge of the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the investigation, and information provided to me by other law 
enforcement officers. This affidavit does not purport to contain all the information known 
to me about this case but addresses only that information necessary to support a finding of 
probable cause for the issuance of a criminal complaint charging Alfredo Rodriguez with 
obstruction of official proceedings, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 
1512(c). 
3. 
On October 27, 2009, agents of the FBI met with and interviewed a 
cooperating witness ("CW"). The CW reported that, while conducting discovery in a 
pending civil case before the United States District Court for the Southern District ofFlorida, 
he came into contact with Alfredo Rodriguez ("Rodriguez"), who was a subpoenaed witness 
in the civil case. 
4. 
Rodriguez had been interviewed by FBI agents on January 18, 2007, in 
connection with a federal criminal investigation into the sexual exploitation of minors. Prior 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-11   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 3 of 7
Case 9:09-mj-08308-LRJ ~ument 3 
Entered on FLSD Dock~2/09/2009 Page 3 of 7 
to being interviewed by FBI, Rodriguez had also been contacted and interviewed by local 
police detectives, and had been asked to produce documents related to the criminal 
investigation. The civil litigation involving the CW related to civil damages claims made by 
victims of the criminal activity that formed the basis of the state and federal criminal 
investigations. 
5. 
The CW explained to agents that Rodriguez had been deposed under oath on 
two occasions. The first deposition occurred on July 27, 2009, and the second deposition 
was conducted on August 9, 2009. In connection with those depositions, Rodriguez was 
served with a subpoena duces tecum that called for the production of several types of 
documentary evidence. The CW was present for both depositions and Rodriguez testified 
that he had no documents responsive to the subpoena duces tecum. 
6. 
In August 2009, after the conclusion of the second deposition, the CW received 
a phone call from Rodriguez. Rodriguez informed the CW that he had additional information 
that he had not previously disclosed to any law enforcement agency or any of the civil 
attorneys. Rodriguez described the information as, the Holy Grail or Golden Nugget and 
explained that he had compiled lists of additional victims in the case and their contact 
information. Rodriguez explained that the information contained hundreds of additional 
victims and their phone numbers from diverse geographic locations, including New York, 
New Mexico, and Paris, France. 
7. 
Rodriguez asked the CW to pay him $50,000.00 and, in return, Rodriguez 
would tum over the documents relating to the victims. In his initial and subsequent 
2 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-11   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 4 of 7
Case 9:09-mj-08308-LRJ ~ument 3 
Entered on FLSD Dock~2/09/2009 Page 4 of 7 
communications with Rodriguez, the CW explained to Rodriguez that he was under 
subpoena to tum over such information and that it would be illegal for Rodriguez to demand 
money for turning over the information. Rodriguez persisted that he would only tum over 
the information in his possession in exchange for $50,000.00. 
8. 
On October 28, 2009, in a consensually-monitored phone call, the CW 
telephoned Rodriguez. 
Rodriguez again indicated that he would not tum over the 
information relating to the additional victims without monetary compensation. Rodriguez 
was told that an associate of the CW would be in touch with him regarding the information 
and exchange. The associate that the CW referred to was, in fact, an undercover employee 
(UCE) of the FBI. 
9. 
On October 29, 2009, the FBI UCE contacted Rodriguez via telephone. 
Rodriguez again explained that he would only tum over the information in exchange for 
monetary compensation. The UCE advised Rodriguez that it would take several days to 
acquire the funds and that once the funds were obtained, he/she would contact Rodriguez. 
During the conversation, Rodriguez admitted that he knew that the information was relevant 
to the FBI' s criminal investigation and was called for by the investigation. Rodriguez 
explained that he had not turned over the information to the FBI because: (1) it was his 
"property" and he should be compensated for it; and (2) he was afraid that the target of the 
investigation would make him "disappear" or otherwise harm him, and the information was 
his "insurance policy." 
10. 
On November 2, 2009, the UCE made contact with Rodriguez via telephone.

In that conversation, Rodriguez and the UCE continued the discussion regarding the purchase 
of the documents and scheduled a meeting for the following day. 
11. 
On November 3, 2009, Rodriguez met with the UCE at a predetermined 
location. During the meeting, Rodriguez produced a small bound book and several sheets 
of legal pad paper containing hand written notes. Rodriguez explained that he had taken the 
bound book from his former employer's residence while employed there in 2004 to 2005 and 
that the book had been created by persons working for his former employer. Rodriguez 
discussed in detail the information contained within the book, and identified important 
information to the UCE. In addition, Rodriguez admitted he had previously lied to FBI. 
Rodriguez asked the UCE about the $50,000.00, took possession of the money, and began 
counting it. 
12. 
Rodriguez was then detained for Obstruction of Official Proceedings, Title 18, 
U.S. Code, Section I 512( c ), and questioned. After Miranda warnings were administered by 
agents, Rodriguez waived his rights and signed a written waiver of those rights. Rodriguez 
admitted that he had the documents and book in his possession and had never turned them 
over to local law enforcement or the FBI. In addition, Rodriguez advised he had witnessed 
nude girls whom he believed were underage at the pool area of his former employer's home, 
knew that his former employer was engaging in sexual contact with underage girls, and had 
viewed pornographic images of underage girls on computers in his employer's home. 
Rodriguez was then released from custody for further investigation.

The items that Rodriguez had attempted to sell to the UC for $50,000.00

w 
were reviewed by an agent familiar with the underlying criminal investigation. As Rodriguez 
had described, the items contained information material to the underlying investigation that 
would have been extremely useful in investigating and prosecuting the case, including the 
names and contact information of material witnesses and additional victims. Had those items 
been produced in response to the inquiries of the state law enforcement officers or the FBI 
Special Agents, their contents would have been presented to the federal grand jury. 
Based upon the foregoing, your affiant believes that probable cause exists to believe 
that, from at least as early as January 18, 2007 through on or about November 3, 2009, in 
Palm Beach County, in the Southern District of Florida, and elsewhere, Alfredo Rodriguez 
did corruptly conceal a record, document, or other object, with the intent to impair the 
object's availability for use in an official proceeding and otherwise corruptly obstructed or 
impeded an official proceeding, in violation ofTitle 18, United States Code, Section 1512( c ).
