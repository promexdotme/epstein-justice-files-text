CONSENT ORDER 
WHEREAS, the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America 
(“Comptroller”), through his national bank examiners and other staff of the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), has conducted examinations of JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, 
California; and Chase Bank USA, N.A., Newark, Delaware (collectively referred to as 
“Bank”). The OCC has identified deficiencies in the Bank’s overall program for Bank 
Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (“BSA/AML”) compliance and has informed the 
Bank of the findings resulting from the examinations. 
WHEREAS, the Bank, by and through its duly elected and acting Boards of 
Directors (collectively referred to as “Board”), has executed a “Stipulation and Consent 
to the Issuance of a Consent Order,” dated January__14___, 2013, that is accepted by the 
Page 1 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 2 of 37

Comptroller (“Stipulation”).  By this Stipulation and Consent, which is incorporated by 
reference, the Bank has consented to the issuance of this Consent Cease and Desist Order 
(“Order”) by the Comptroller, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b).  The Bank has begun 
corrective action, and has committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to 
remedy the deficiencies identified by the OCC, and to enhance the Bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program. 
ARTICLE I 
COMPTROLLER’S FINDINGS 
The Comptroller finds, and the Bank neither admits nor denies, the following: 
(1) 
The OCC’s examination findings establish that the Bank has deficiencies 
in its BSA/AML compliance program.  These deficiencies have resulted in the failure to 
correct a previously reported problem and a BSA/AML compliance program violation 
under 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s) and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. § 21.21 (BSA 
Compliance Program).  In addition, the Bank has violated 12 C.F.R. § 21.11 (Suspicious 
Activity Report Filings). 
(2) 
The Bank has failed to adopt and implement a compliance program that 
adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate system 
of internal controls, and ineffective independent testing.  The Bank did not develop 
adequate due diligence on customers, particularly in the Commercial and Business 
Banking Unit, a repeat problem, and failed to file all necessary Suspicious Activity 
Reports (“SARs”) related to suspicious customer activity. 
(3) 
The Bank failed to correct previously identified systemic weaknesses in 
the adequacy of customer due diligence and the effectiveness of monitoring in light of the 
Page 2 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 3 of 37

customers’ cash activity and business type, constituting a deficiency in its BSA/AML 
compliance program and resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(B). 
(4) 
Some of the critical deficiencies in the elements of the Bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program, resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(A) and 12 C.F.R. 
§ 21.21, include the following: 
(a)  
The Bank has an inadequate system of internal controls and 
independent testing. 
(b)  
The Bank has less than satisfactory risk assessment processes that 
do not provide an adequate foundation for management’s efforts to 
identify, manage, and control risk.  
(c)  
The Bank has systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring 
systems, due diligence processes, risk management, and quality 
assurance programs. 
(d)  
The Bank does not have enterprise-wide policies and procedures to 
ensure that foreign branch suspicious activity involving customers 
of other bank branches is effectively communicated to other 
affected branch locations and applicable AML operations staff.   
The Bank also does not have enterprise-wide policies and 
procedures to ensure that on a risk basis, customer transactions at 
foreign branch locations can be assessed, aggregated, and 
monitored. 
Page 3 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 4 of 37

(e)  
The Bank has significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making 
protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and 
alerts are properly documented, tracked, and resolved. 
(5) 
The Bank failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and 
file the required SARs concerning suspicious customer activities, in violation of 
12 C.F.R. § 21.11. In some of these cases, the Bank self-identified the issues and is 
engaged in remediation. 
(6) 
The Bank’s internal controls, including filtering processes and 
independent testing, with respect to Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) 
compliance are inadequate. 
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: 
ARTICLE II  
COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE  
(1) 
The Board shall appoint and maintain a Compliance Committee of at least 
three (3) directors, of which a majority may not be employees or officers of the Bank or 
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  The names of the initial members of the Compliance 
Committee shall be submitted in writing to the Examiner-in-Charge for a written 
determination of no supervisory objection.  In the event of a change of the membership, 
the name of any new member shall be submitted in writing to the Examiner-in-Charge at 
the Bank (“Examiner-in-Charge”) for a written determination of no supervisory 
objection. The Compliance Committee shall be responsible for coordinating and 
Page 4 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 5 of 37

monitoring the Bank’s adherence to the provisions of this Order.  The Compliance 
Committee shall meet at least monthly and maintain minutes of its meetings. 
(2) 
Within ninety (90) days of this Order, and quarterly thereafter, the 
Compliance Committee shall submit a written progress report to the Board setting forth 
in detail the actions taken to comply with each Article of this Order, and the results and 
status of those actions, including improvements to the BSA/AML Program. 
(3) 
The Board shall forward a copy of the Compliance Committee’s report, 
with any additional comments by the Board, to the Deputy Comptroller for Large Bank 
Supervision (“Deputy Comptroller”) and the Examiner-in-Charge within ten (10) days of 
receiving such report. 
ARTICLE III  
COMPREHENSIVE BSA/AML ACTION PLAN  
(1) 
Within sixty (60) days of this Order, the Bank shall submit to the Deputy 
Comptroller and the Examiner-in-Charge a plan containing a complete description of the 
actions that are necessary and appropriate to achieve full compliance with Articles IV 
through XI of this Order (“BSA/AML Action Plan”).  The Bank shall implement the 
BSA/AML Action Plan upon the Deputy Comptroller’s issuance of a written 
determination of no supervisory objection.  In the event the Deputy Comptroller requires 
the Bank to revise the plan, the Bank shall promptly make and the Board shall approve 
necessary and appropriate revisions and resubmit the BSA/AML Action Plan to the 
Deputy Comptroller and Examiner-in-Charge for review and determination of no 
supervisory objection. Following implementation, the Bank shall not take any action that 
Page 5 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 6 of 37

unless and until the Bank has received a prior written determination of no supervisory 
objection from the Deputy Comptroller. 
(a)  
The Board shall ensure that the Bank achieves and thereafter 
maintains compliance with this Order, including, without 
limitation, successful implementation of the BSA/AML Action 
Plan. The Board shall further ensure that, upon implementation of 
the BSA/AML Action Plan, the Bank achieves and maintains an 
effective BSA/AML compliance program, in accordance with the 
BSA and its implementing regulations. In each instance in this 
Order in which the Board is required to ensure adherence to or 
undertake to perform certain obligations of the Bank, it is intended 
to mean that the Board shall: Authorize and adopt such actions on 
behalf of the Bank as may be necessary for the Bank to perform its 
obligations and undertakings. 
(b)  
Require the timely reporting by Bank management of such actions 
directed by the Board to be taken under this Order;  
(c)

Page 6 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 7 of 37

BSA/AML Action Plan shall be consistent with any deadlines set forth in these Articles, 
unless modified by written agreement with the Deputy Comptroller or the Examiner-in-
Charge. 
(3) 
Upon request by the Deputy Comptroller or the Examiner-in-Charge, the 
Bank shall modify the BSA/AML Action Plan to address any Matters Requiring 
Attention concerning BSA/AML matters, or citations of violations of law concerning 
BSA/AML matters, which the OCC may issue to the Bank following the effective date of 
this Order. 
(4) 
The Bank shall ensure that it has sufficient processes, personnel, and 
control systems to implement and adhere to this Order.  The BSA/AML Action Plan must 
specify in detail budget outlays and staffing, including aggregated staff compensation 
information in a format acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge, that are necessary to 
achieve and maintain full compliance with Articles IV through XI of this Order. 
(5) 
Any independent consultant or auditor engaged by the Bank or the Board 
to assist in the assessment of the BSA/AML Action Plan or other compliance with this 
Order must have demonstrated and specialized experience with the BSA/AML matters 
that are the subject of the engagement, and must not be subject to any conflict of interest 
affecting the consultant’s or auditor’s independence.

ARTICLE IV  
MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
(1) 
The Bank shall ensure there are clear lines of authority and responsibility 
for BSA/AML and OFAC compliance with respect to lines of business and corporate 
functions, and that competent and independent compliance management is in place on a 
full-time basis.  
(2) 
The Bank shall ensure that compliance staff has the appropriate level of 
authority to implement the BSA/AML Compliance Program and, as needed, question 
account relationships and business plans. Compliance staff shall maintain independence 
from the business line.  The Bank shall follow any applicable guidance addressing 
independence issued by the OCC or the FFIEC. 
(3) 
The Bank shall ensure that senior management and line of business 
management are accountable for effectively implementing bank policies and procedures, 
and fulfilling BSA/AML/OFAC obligations.  The Bank shall incorporate BSA/AML and 
OFAC compliance into the performance evaluation process for senior and line of 
business management.  Additionally, written Bank policies and procedures shall clearly

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 9 of 37

(5) 
The Board shall not permit any other party, including but not limited to the 
Bank’s holding company, to perform any act on behalf of the Bank which is the subject 
of this Order, unless the Bank requires that party to perform such act in the manner and 
under safeguards and controls as least as stringent as required by the Bank under the 
terms of this Order as implemented by the Bank. 
ARTICLE V 
BSA/AML AND OFAC COMPLIANCE PROGRAM EVALUATION 
AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
(1) 
Within 60 days of this Order, the Bank shall provide an action plan for the 
completion of an evaluation of the Bank’s BSA/AML and OFAC Compliance Programs 
to the Examiner-in-Charge for no supervisory objection.  If the Examiner-in-Charge 
recommends changes to the evaluation, the Bank shall incorporate those changes or 
suggest alternatives that are acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge. 
(2) 
The evaluation required pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this Article shall be 
completed and submitted to the Examiner-in-Charge within 90 days following the non-
objection of the Examiner-in-Charge to the action plan referred to in Article V(1). This 
evaluation shall include assessments of the BSA/AML and OFAC Compliance Programs’ 
organizational structure, enterprise-wide effectiveness, competency of management, 
accountability, staffing requirements, internal controls, customer due diligence processes, 
risk assessment processes, suspicious activity monitoring systems, audit/independent 
testing, and training. The evaluation shall include recommendations for enhancements 
needed to achieve remediation of any deficiencies identified in the evaluation. 
Page 9 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 10 of 37

(3) 
This evaluation shall also include a comprehensive assessment of the 
Bank’s BSA/AML risk, including detailed quantification of risk to accurately assess the 
level of risk and the adequacy of controls.  The comprehensive assessment shall include: 
(a)  
An assessment of the AML risk associated with each line of 
business, and an enterprise-wide assessment of AML risk.  This 
evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the 
risk associated with correspondent banking, pre-paid cards and 
mobile banking, cash-intensive businesses, remote deposit capture, 
business, commercial, and private banking, and other higher risk 
products, services, customers, or geographies.  The purpose of the 
enterprise-wide assessment is to identify systemic AML risk that 
may not be apparent in a risk assessment focused on line of 
business or assessment units;      
(b)  
Evaluation of the Bank’s current methodology for identifying and 
quantifying the level of BSA/AML risk associated with categories 
of customers and for specific customers.  The methodology should 
ensure that the relationships are reviewed holistically, across lines 
of business, taking into consideration the risk within the Bank.  
This evaluation shall result in the development of a comprehensive 
approach to quantifying BSA/AML risk for new and existing 
customers.  The quantification of risk shall encompass a 
customer’s entire relationship with the Bank, include the purpose 
of the account, actual or anticipated activity in the account (e.g., 
Page 10 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 11 of 37

type, volume, and value (number and dollar) of transaction activity 
engaged in), nature of the customer’s business or occupation, 
customer location (e.g., customers’ geographic location, where 
they transact business, and have significant operations), types of 
products and services used by the customer, material changes in 
the customer’s relationship with the Bank, as well as other factors 
discussed within the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual; 
(c)  
The identification of specific lines of business, geographies, 
products or processes where controls are not commensurate with 
the level of AML risk exposure; 
(d)  
The risk assessment shall be refreshed periodically, the timeframe 
for which shall not exceed twelve months, or whenever there is a 
significant change in AML risk within the Bank or line of business.  
The AML risk assessments shall also be independently reviewed 
by the Bank’s internal audit function for the adequacy of 
identification of risk; control plan to manage identified risks; gap 
analyses where controls are not sufficient; and action plans to 
address gaps; and 
(e)  
The aggregation of the Bank’s enterprise-wide AML risk shall be 
logical and clearly supported in the work papers.  The work papers 
and supporting documentation shall be readily accessible for   
OCC review. 
Page 11 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 12 of 37

(4) 
OFAC risk shall be included within the BSA/AML risk assessment, using 
the same criteria as described above in paragraphs 2(a) through (e) of this Article.  
ARTICLE VI  
CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE  
(1) 
Within 90 days of this Order, the Bank shall ensure that appropriate 
customer due diligence policies, procedures, and processes are developed.  These controls 
shall be implemented and applied on a Bank-wide basis.  Minimum corporate standards 
shall provide general guidance, and individual lines of business and AML compliance 
management shall develop standards based on their client base, products, services, 
geographic risk, and other AML risk factors.  Customer due diligence shall be 
commensurate with the customer’s risk profile, and sufficient for the bank to develop an 
understanding of normal and expected activity for the customer’s occupation or business 
operations. The customer due diligence process shall include the following items: 
(a)  
Information regarding the client’s/customer’s relationships with 
the Bank, all lines of business within the Bank, and all Bank 
subsidiaries or affiliates (that are subject to management control by 
the Banks’ holding company).  This includes accounts within other 
lines of business, regions, and countries (as permitted by 
jurisdiction).  The relationship includes its owners, principals, 
signers, subsidiaries, affiliates, and parties with the ability to 
manage or control the account or client; 
Page 12 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 13 of 37

(b)  
An electronic due diligence database, which includes information 
specified in subparagraph (a) above, that is readily accessible to 
the relationship manager or other parties responsible for the 
customer relationship, AML compliance personnel, suspicious 
activity monitoring alert analysts and investigators, and quality 
control and assurance personnel; 
(c)  
Customer due diligence shall be periodically updated to reflect 
changes in the customer’s behavior, activity profile, derogatory 
information, periodic reviews of the customer relationship, or other 
factors that impact the AML risk for the client and shall include 
any remediation required by the standards required by the Article. 
The frequency of the periodic update of due diligence shall be 
based on risk with the update performed at least annually for high-
risk relationships, triennially for low-risk business relationships, 
and as appropriate for low-risk individuals.  The periodic updates 
shall be documented, and subject to quality assurance processes; 
(d)  
The client relationship AML risk shall be detailed in the customer 
due diligence record, along with the supporting factors, including 
transaction activity, geographies involved, and suspicious activity 
monitoring alert and filing history, among others; 
(e)  
Specialized or enhanced due diligence for higher risk clients and/or 
products and services shall be implemented enterprise-wide.  
These due diligence standards shall comply with the FFIEC 
Page 13 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 14 of 37

BSA/AML Examination Manual, the Interagency Guidance on 
Beneficial Ownership Information (OCC 2010-11), as well as 
industry standards; and 
(f)  
Management processes to periodically review, based on the 
relationship risk, the type, volume, and value of customer activities 
in relation to normal and expected levels.  The purpose of these 
reviews shall be to determine if the customer’s activity is 
reasonable, that customer due diligence is current and complete, 
and the customer risk rating is accurate.  These reviews shall be 
documented and quality assurance processes must ensure the 
reviews are comprehensive and accurate.  Standards and processes 
shall be established for elevating reviews for additional 
management consideration regarding increased monitoring, 
additional due diligence, or account closure/   
(2) 
The Bank shall submit its policies and procedures for customer due 
diligence to the Examiner-in-Charge for prior no supervisory objection.  If the Examiner­
in-Charge recommends changes to the policies or procedures, the Bank shall incorporate 
those changes or suggest alternatives that are acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge. 
ARTICLE VII  
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING  
(1) 
Within 60 days of this Order, the Bank shall develop and thereafter shall 
maintain a written program of policies and procedures to ensure, pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 
Page 14 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 15 of 37

§ 21.11, the timely and appropriate review and disposition of suspicious activity alerts, 
and the timely filing of Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”). 
(2) 
Within 30 days of this Order, the Bank shall retain or continue an existing 
or newly revised relationship with one or more independent consultants acceptable to the 
Examiner-in-Charge to evaluate its suspicious activity identification processes to ensure 
they are effective and provide comprehensive coverage to the Bank.  This evaluation 
shall include an assessment of the capabilities of any surveillance and transaction 
monitoring systems used; the scope of coverage provided by the systems; and the 
management of those systems.  Upon completion, the Bank shall submit this evaluation 
to the Examiner-in-Charge for no supervisory objection.  The evaluation shall address, 
but not be limited to, the following issue: 
(a)  
An assessment of the functionality of automated transaction 
monitoring systems used to determine if the systems are 
sufficiently robust to provide for the timely identification of 
potentially suspicious activity.  A comprehensive listing of 
weaknesses or deficiencies in the system and the risks presented by 
these deficiencies shall be highlighted for management 
consideration; 
(3) 
Management’s implementation of each surveillance and transaction 
monitoring system shall ensure the following: 
(a)  
The integrity of data feeding the transaction monitoring systems; 
(b)  
The system has been sufficiently tailored to the Bank’s risk profile 
and operations;

(c)  
The system’s functionality is being utilized to appropriately 
address risk, including the ability to aggregate data across 
platforms, lines of business, and relationships; and 
(d)  
The business logic units, parameters, rules, or other factors 
selected for automated monitoring are appropriate and effective in 
identifying client activity that is unreasonable or abnormal given 
the nature of the client’s occupation or business and expected 
activity. In addition, there shall be:  
(i)  
Sufficient management information and metrics to manage 
and adjust the system, as necessary; and 
(ii)  
Statistically valid processes to validate and optimize 
monitoring system settings and thresholds, and to measure 
the effectiveness of the automated system and individual 
scenarios, where appropriate.  
(4) 
Management implementation of the alert investigation processes shall 
ensure the following: 
(a)  
The adequacy of staffing to investigate and clear alerts;   
(b)  
The quality and completeness of information available to analysts 
working transaction monitoring alerts and conducting 
investigations;   
(c)  
The standards for dispositioning different types of alerts are 
reasonable, communicated in writing to relevant staff, and are 
adhered to by the alert investigators;     
Page 16 of 26

(d)  
Adequate documentation is maintained to support the disposition 
of alerts; 
(e)  
The availability and adequacy of information to investigate 
potentially suspicious activity, including, if applicable, information 
from multiple lines of business a customer transacts with or 
information from bank subsidiaries or affiliates (that are subject to 
management control by the Banks’ holding company), and 
information concerning foreign suspicious activity reports 
involving United States customers;  
(f)  
Standards that ensure accounts with high volumes of alerts are 
identified, elevated, and properly categorized as high risk, and 
subject to enhanced due diligence and monitoring; and 
(g)  
Sufficient quality control processes to ensure the surveillance and 
transaction monitoring system, alert management process, and 
SAR decisioning and filing are working effectively and according 
to internal standards. 
ARTICLE VIII 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT REVIEW (“SAR LOOK-BACK”) 
(1) 
Within 30 days of this Order, the Banks shall provide to the Examiner-in-
Charge for prior no supervisory objection an action plan to review the quality of SAR 
filings (“SAR look-back”).  The purpose of the SAR look-back is to review the quality of 
SARs filed and determine whether corrections or amendments are necessary to ensure 
Page 17 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 18 of 37

that the suspicious activity identified was accurately reported in accordance with 12 
C.F.R. § 21.11, and whether additional SARs should be filed on additional subjects or for 
continuing suspicious activity. 
(2) 
The SAR look-back must be supervised and certified by independent 
consultant(s) acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge with expertise in conducting look-
back reviews for large institutions. 
(3) 
Upon completion of the SAR look-back: (i) the Bank shall ensure that 
SARs have been filed, in accordance with 12 C.F.R. § 21.11, for any previously reported 
suspicious activity identified during this review; (ii) the written findings shall be reported 
to the Board; and (iii) the Bank will provide the Examiner-in-Charge with a report, 
containing relevant information, including the number of modified or amended SARs and 
any additional or continuing activity SARs filed as a result of the review.   
(4) 
Based upon the results of the SAR look-back, the OCC may expand the 
scope of the independent review or require a longer SAR look-back period.  If an 
additional SAR look-back is deemed appropriate by the OCC, the Bank shall complete 
the SAR look-back in accordance with this Article.  
ARTICLE IX  
ACCOUNT/TRANSACTION ACTIVITY AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT  
REVIEW (“ACCOUNT AND TRANSACTION LOOK-BACK”)  
(1) 
Within 30 days of this Order, the Bank shall provide to the Examiner-in-
Charge for prior no supervisory objection an action plan to conduct an independently 
supervised review of account and transaction activity (“account and transaction look-
Page 18 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 19 of 37

back”) covering non-bank financial institutions, as defined in the FFIEC BSA/AML 
Examination Manual.  
(2) 
The purpose of the account and transaction look-back is to determine 
whether suspicious activity was timely identified by the Bank, and, if appropriate to do 
so, was then timely reported by the Bank in accordance with 12 C.F.R. § 21.11. 
(3) 
The account and transaction look-back must be supervised and certified by 
independent consultant(s) with expertise in conducting look-back reviews for large 
institutions. The account and transaction look-back shall be risk-based, including the 
risks identified in the Bank’s risk assessment as revised under Article V, and shall 
identify the sampling, software screening, or analytical techniques used to identify 
transactions that are subject to review for suspicious activity. 
(4)

The Bank’s Audit Program shall report all internal audit- and OCC-
identified deficiencies to the Compliance Committee, the Bank’s Audit Committee, and 
to senior compliance management.  The reports shall indicate the severity of the

ARTICLE XI  
NEW ACCOUNTS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR MARKET  
SEGMENTS/INDUSTRIES  
(1) 
The Bank shall ensure that new products and services are subject to senior

increase in alert volume as a result of the new business. 
(2) 
The Bank shall not enter into a new high-risk (inherent quantity) market 
segment/industry, enter into new or expand existing high-risk (inherent quantity) lines of

has the ultimate responsibility for proper and sound management of the Bank. 
(2) 
If, at any time, the Comptroller deems it appropriate in fulfilling the

otherwise prevent the Comptroller from so doing.

(3) 
This Order constitutes a settlement of the cease and desist proceeding 
against the Bank contemplated by the Comptroller, based on the unsafe or unsound 
practices and violations of law or regulation described in the Comptroller’s Findings set 
forth in Article I of this Order. The OCC releases and discharges the Bank from all 
potential liability for a cease and desist order that has been or might have been asserted 
by the OCC based on the practices and violations described in the Comptroller’s Findings 
set forth in Article I of the Order, to the extent known to the OCC as of the effective date 
of the Order. Provided, however, that nothing in the Stipulation or this Order shall 
prevent the Comptroller from instituting other enforcement actions against the Bank or 
any of its institution-affiliated parties, including, without limitation, assessment of civil 
money penalties, based on the findings set forth in this Order, or any other findings, and 
nothing in the Stipulation or this Order shall preclude or affect any right of the OCC to 
determine and ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of the Stipulation or this 
Order. 
(4) 
This Order is and shall become effective upon its execution by the

issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b), and expressly does not form, and may not be 
construed to form, a contract binding the Comptroller or the United States.  Without
