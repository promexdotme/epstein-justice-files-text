CASE NO.: ST-2021-RV-

Originating Case No.: 
ST-2019-00080 
AFFIDAVIT OF DANIEL H. WEINER 
I, Daniel H. Weiner, Esq., declare and affirm as follows: 
1. 
I am an attorney admitted to practice in Florida and New York. I am admitted pro 
hac vice to practice in the Virgin Islands in connection with this probate proceeding (the 
"Probate Action"). 
2. 
I am a 1981 graduate cum laude of Princeton University and a 1984 graduate of 
the New York University School of Law. Since 1993, I have been a partner at Hughes Hubbard 
and Reed LLP ("Hughes Hubbard"), counsel for Darren K. Indyke as Co-Executor of the estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein in the Probate Action. 
3. 
I attach as Exhibit A a copy of my professional profile as posted on Hughes 
Hubbard's website. The facts contained therein are true and accurate. 
4. 
My current standard hourly billing rate is $1,450. Clients customarily pay this 
rate for my services. 
5. 
In my representation of Mr. Indyke, I charged $1,315 per hour for hours billed in 
in January 2020, which was my standard rate at the time and reflects a 9% discount from my 
current standard rates. For hours billed in 2021, I charged $1,251 per hour, which reflects a 10% 

discount from my standard rate at the time of $1,390 per hour and a 13.7% discount from my 
current standard rates. The Epstein Estate pays these rates for my representation of Mr. Indyke. 
2 
6. 
My hourly rates are customary and reasonable for similarly experienced attorneys 
practicing law with firms similar to Hughes Hubbard in New York City. 
7. 
I attach as Exhibit B a chart showing my contemporaneous time entries relating to 
the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, as those terms are defined in the Motion for Award of Costs 
and Attorneys' Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof, filed herewith. 
The services for which I charged were actually and necessarily performed in connection with the 
GVI Motions and GVI Appeal. 
8. 
I affirm and declare under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States of 
America that the foregoing is true and correct.
