ARGUMENT 
- -· ... -----------------------
"The power to stay proceedings Is incidental to the power Inherent In every court to control the disposition of the causes on its 
docket with economy of time and effort for Itself, for counsel, and for litigants". •Burke V. Treasure Bay V.I. Corp., 2016 WL 
9503682, at •3 (V.1. Super. Oct. 6, 2016) (citing Landis V. North American Co., 299-U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936). Generally, the party 
seeking a1sta.y •must make out a ctear case of hardship or inequity In being required to go forward, If there Is even a fair 
possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to someone else.• Landis, 299 U.S. at 254. To that end, In 
determining whether to grant a motion to stay, courts have considered the following factors: (1) whether a sta.y will simplify 
issues and promote judicial economy; (2) the balance of harm to the parties; and (3) tJ,6 length of the requested stay. See 
Burke, 2016 WL 9503682, at *3; Cheyney State Coll. Faculty V. Hufstedler, 703 F.2d 732, 737•38 (3d Clr.1983' (citing Landis, 
299 U.S.at 254 -55). There Is no prejudice to the Defendants', nor have they suggested any, for the Court tft-bt to grant a 
stay, and there Is llkellhood·that the Plaintiff will prevail In the court of Appeal.

Plaintiff filed her appeal 28th February 2023. (See Appear}. (See Exhibit B). Plaintiff has asked the Appeal court to over tum her 
conviction based on errors made by both the govemment'and the trial court, several of which are fatal and whl"h would result in 
the dismissal of the criminal proceedings. Point 1:·•A11 counts should be dismissed pursuant to the Non Prosecution 
agreement". Point 2. "All counts are barred by statute of Jlmltatlons'. Point 3 "Plaintiff was denied her constituUonal right to a 
fair and Impartial jury because a juror made false statements in Volr Dire as to material facts that If known would have provided 
valid basis to remove him for cause•. Point 4. "The court constructively amended counts 3 & 4 of the indictment•. Defendants\ 
In case before this court. have argued for Its dismissal, In part, as Plaintiff, "cannot be indemnified for intentional wrong doing 
Including criminal conduct• (See RBMD at pp 3-4 n.2.). (Doc. 20). The outcome of the Plaintiffs appeal could render various of 
the Defendants' arguments for dismissal Invalid as ti ,ay would not hold water as the Plaintiff would no longer ~~ ~r.•i!cti;-1 of 
criminal conduct. A stay Is requested for judicial economy until such time that the Appeal court has ruled. 
PLAJNTlFF SEEKING NEW COUNSEL 
Plaintiff Is seeklng·New·counsel as she Is aware It Is preferable for all parties to be represented for efficiency and for judicial 
economy. Plalntfff !aces challenges finding New Counsel as many potential candidates are conflicted and Plaintiff Is facing 
financial constraints. All Incarcerated people have communication challenges, as Plaintiff does. Her situation is not unique but 
for the court_s consideration, It bears noting that Plaintiff has no ablllty to write snail mall, E Mall, or call any potentlal new 
attomeywlth client attorney privilege. Communications with client attorney privilege are permitted with attorneys of record. 
Communications with othe~ req~lre pre app,:ov" which ten~s Itself to potential delays for approval. Plaintiff Is seeking a stay 
because .~t ttie extiiflim~ she'needs, due td ttje· partlcular challenges· elucidated, to find and communicate with potential new 
Counsel. ,.

CLAIMS AGAINST NES ANO OTHER ENTITIES 
Plaintiff Is surprised by Defendants' improper invitation to dismiss Plaintiff's claims based on NES 2014 Operating Agreement, a 
period of time long after Plafntlff ceased working for Epstein. (see Compl. p15. n46). (Doc 1 ). It Is a bridge to far to suggest a 
sophisticated businessman like Epstein, sole member of NES, with experienced lawyers and financial advisors, would forgo the 
protections afforded by an'Operating Agreement"for 16 years, from 1998- 2014 the date the Defendants' produced NES 
Operating Agreement. (See MTO & attached Exhibit C, NES Operating Agreement). (Doc 7). Defendants' suggest there Is no 
legal or factual bast~ to, b,~.u~v~. ~at an eartfe~ ~lffe~!'_t ~reem~nt ~ver existed (telllng the language of ~e NES operating 
agreement' does riot reference or purport to amend ·any prior operating agreement) (see RBMD. p.8 n.9.). (Doc. 20). These 
arguments1 a~ self serV!ng. Everi If the court were 'to CflK!ft Defendants' arguments, and It should not, under New York Law 
llmited Uablilty coi:Jipanf~s·, when no Operating Agreement exists, the LLC Is subject to •numerous sections In the (Limited 
llabll1ty·Compariy Law) that set'forth default provisions applfcabfe to the limited llablllty company"). N.Y. Limit. Llab. Co. 420. 
Plaintiff seeks a~clltional 6me to review NY'~lrtijt~cf'llablllty Compahy law, and additional case law relevant to arguments 
presented·, and to review Vlrgfn Island law whilst searching for an eartler Operating Agreement Plaintiff believes exists.

Resp_o 
to a status hearing 
Plaintiff was employed by various other entitles owned by Epstein (see Compl. p.8 n.52). (Doc.1 ). Defendants' suggested that 
other entities Plaintiff said she was employed by only ilkely" had Indemnity, and that her claims are ioo thin• to satisfy the 
requirement for all elements of her claim. (see MTO p.8 n.8). (Doc 7). Plaintiff has located a lawsuit filed In earty 2000's. United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nelson Shanks v. Leslie Wexner and Abigail Wexner, Jeffrey 
Epstein and J. Epstein and Co. Inc and Ghislaine Maxwell. Case No. 02-7671. ("Shanks"). (See Exhibit E). The lawsuit was 
regarding the non payment for painting the Wexner family by Shanks. Plaintiff wasJndemnifled for her Involvement In the 
Shanks suit, as she was for other suits (see PB p.12). (Doc 39). This affirmatively demonstrates Defendants' indemnifying 
, 
Plaintiff for legal costs and ts Illustrative of a pattern that supports Plaintiffs argument that she was indemnified for all legal 
proceedings Incurred by reason of her employment by Epstein. Plaintiff Is also aware of new ongoing litigation surrounding 
Epstein and the Estate through which previously undisclosed information continues to surface, and Plaintiff Is researching, 
believing that it contains pertinent information. As an example of new probative information that has come to light, in an 
interview that Epstein gave In his own voice that was recently aired, Epstein Is quoted saying in part of the Interview, "it's, it's 
just unfair because she (Plaintiff) really plays no role, and Ghislaine was never, never ever a apart of any of this stuff.• (Netfllx: 
Filthy Rich. 25th Nov, 2022). 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth herein Plalntlff respectfully requests a 180 day stay of pro~dlngs, or until Plaintiff's Appeal is 
rendered or any amount of time this court deems right and proper. 
Respectfully submitted,
