mmor. 
5. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State ofNew York. 
6. 
This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million. 
7. 
This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
8. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) as a substantial 
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations 
9. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
10. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one 
of his victims. 
11. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
12. 
An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/25/2008   Page 3 of 7
Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
13. 
Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at 
Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, 
who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen 
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition 
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter 
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and 
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and 
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
14. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room 
with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He demanded that Jane remove her 
clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her 
underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane. 
15. 
After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought 
Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane 
to him. 
16. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral.
