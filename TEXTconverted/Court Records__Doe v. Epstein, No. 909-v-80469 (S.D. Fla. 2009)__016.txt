PLAINTIFF’S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO SERVE
REPLY TO DEFENDANT, JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S, MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff, JANE DOE II, respectfully requests an enlargement of time to serve her
Reply to Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S, Motion to Dismiss, and would show in support:
1.
The Reply to Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S, Motion to Dismiss is due May
15, 2009. Due to the press of other business, Plaintiff’s counsel has been unable to finish
the reply to said motion which raises many complex issues that are typically not addressed
on a motion to dismiss.
2.
Counsel certifies that he has today consulted with Robert Critton, Esq.,
Counsel for Jeffrey Epstein, and he does not oppose an enlargement of time until Friday
May 22, 2009, for Plaintiff to serve her Reply to Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S, Motion
to Dismiss. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant an extension to
serve the Reply to Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S, Motion to Dismiss up to and including
May 22, 2009.
