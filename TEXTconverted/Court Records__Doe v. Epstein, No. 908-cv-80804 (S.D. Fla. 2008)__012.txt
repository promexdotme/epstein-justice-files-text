JANE DOE NO. 1, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, • 
Defendants. 
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE 
AND EXPEDITE. CERTAIN.DISCOVERY 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rules 26 an:d 34 to Preserve Evidence and Expedite 
the Discovery of this Evidence and states: 
1.. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008. (DE 1). 
2. 
Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand on August 18, 2008. (D.E. 11). 
3. It has come to the attention of Plaintiffs counsel that on July _21; 2008, Defendant 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN filed a Motion with the Florida State Court to return the 
evidence seized at his horne in conjunction with his criminal prosecutiofL (Ex. 1 ). 
4. 
This evidence is relevant and critical to the prosecution of not only the insta:ntclaim, 
but for six (6) other claims filed against Defendant EPSTEIN, including .but not 
limited to the Florida RICO claims filed in State Court

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2008   Page 2 of 5
expedite the duplication of this evidence immediately upon its return, in advance of any Rule 26

MEM0RANJ)UM0FLAW 
Pursuant to Rules 26, 30 and 34, of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this court has 
the authority to modify the normal time limitations under the Rules. See AT&T Mobility LLCv. 
Dynamic Cellular Corp., 2008 WL 2139518 (S.D. Fla. 2008); see also Trac/one Wireless, Inc. v. 
King Trading, Inc., 2008 WL 918243 (N.D. Tex. 2008). Additionally, when there is a good faith 
belief that evidence may be lost the Court has the authority to enter an Order preserving such 
evidence. Id at 1. An injunction is not required, nor ate the elements of an injunction necessary 
before entering an Order preserving such evidence. Id at 2. 
Given that Defendant EPSTEIN has plead guilty and is currently serving a year in jail 
based on the charges which form the fourrdation of Plaintiffs (and many other Plaintiffs') claims, 
it is reasonable to assume the State's seized evidence is extremely harmful to Defendant 
EPSTEIN. As a result, without a Protective Order Defendant EPSTEIN has no reasonto keep or 
maintain this negative evidence. 
Plaintiff has put Defendant EPSTEIN on notice that this 
evidence is relevant to the instant action and any destruction could potentially constitute 
spoliation. If this evidence were destroyed Plaintiff would be severely prejudiced. 
CERTIFICATE OF COMPL1ANCE WITH LOCAL RlJLE 7.LA.3 
On August 21,·2008; undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for the Defendants in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues raised in this motion, and Defendants' counsel advised that 
Defendants oppose this motion.
