(Case called) 
MR. ROOS:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Nicolas Roos
and Rebekah Donaleski for the United States.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. FOY:  May it please the Court, your Honor, my name
is Jason Foy, attorney for Ms. Tovah Noel, standing to my left.
Good afternoon, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you.  Good
afternoon.
MR. FIGGINS:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Montel
Figgins, from the Law Offices of Montel Figgins, on behalf of
Michael Thomas, who's standing to my left.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Good afternoon to all of you.
My name is Judge Netburn.
Can I have the date and time of the defendants'
arrests?
MR. ROOS:  Both defendants self-surrendered to the FBI
this morning at approximately 10:00 a.m.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
The purpose of today's proceeding is to advise you of
certain rights that you have, inform you of the charges against
you, consider whether counsel shall be appointed for you, and
decide under what conditions, if any, you shall be released.
I'm now going to explain certain constitutional rights
that you have.

You have the right to remain silent.  You are not
required to make any statements.  Even if you have already made
statements to the authorities, you need not make any further
statements.  Any statements that you do make can be used
against you.
You have the right to be released, either
conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find
that there are no conditions that would reasonably assure your
presence in court or the safety of the community.
You have the right to be represented by an attorney
during all court proceedings, including this one and during all
questioning by the authorities.
If you cannot afford an attorney, I will appoint one
to represent you.  I understand that each of you has retained
private counsel.  If at any point in time you run out of money
and you are unable to afford counsel, you can petition the
Court to appoint counsel at the government's expense and at no
cost to you.
You both have been charged in a six-count indictment,
and I will just state that I understand that Judge Torres has
referred this not just for presentment but also for
arraignment.
MR. ROOS:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  The defendants have both been charged in a
six-count indictment.

Count One charges the defendants with conspiracy in
violation of Title 18 of United States Code, Section 371.  And
Counts Two through Six each charge an individual act of false
records in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections
1001(a)(3) and (2).
Let me ask, Ms. Noel, have you received a copy of this
indictment?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Have you had an opportunity to review it
and discuss the charges with your lawyer?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Would you like me to read the indictment
to you in open court?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  No, thank you.
THE COURT:  How do you plead to the charges?
DEFENDANT NOEL:  Not guilty.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
DEFENDANT NOEL:  You're welcome.
THE COURT:  Mr. Thomas, I'm going to ask you the same
questions.
Have you received a copy of the indictment?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Have you had an opportunity to read the
indictment and discuss the charges with your lawyer?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Would you like me to read the indictment
to you in open court?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  How do you plead to the charges?
DEFENDANT THOMAS:  Not guilty, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Be seated.
Have the parties discussed an appropriate bail
package?
MR. ROOS:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Shall we begin with Ms. Noel?
MR. ROOS:  Certainly, your Honor.  I actually think
the bail packages are nearly identical with the exception of
one or two conditions that are set forth in the pretrial
services report, so maybe I'll first give your Honor all of the
conditions that are the same for each of the defendants and I
will note the variation at the end.
For both defendants, it's $100,000 bond, secured by
two financially responsible persons and their own signature;
pretrial supervision, as directed; surrender of travel
documents, and no new applications; no contact with
codefendants; surrender of firearms.
For travel restrictions, for Defendant Thomas, it will
be Southern District of New York, Eastern District of New York,
and the District of New Jersey.
And for Defendant Noel, it will be Southern District

of New York, Eastern District of New York, District of New
Jersey, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
And then the special conditions that are set forth in
the pretrial reports, it's condition number 4, relating to use
of alcohol for Defendant Thomas, and condition 7 for Defendant
Noel, which relates to mental health evaluation and treatment
as directed by pretrial services.
And, finally, your Honor, that they be both released
today on their own signature.
THE COURT:  And how long do the parties propose to
satisfy the balance of the conditions?
MR. ROOS:  A week is appropriate, your Honor, for the
two cosigners.
THE COURT:  Any objection from defendants?
MR. FIGGINS:  No, your Honor.
MR. FOY:  There is one.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. FOY:  Before today's proceedings, we did have an
agreement on the terms of release.  And, of course, as part of
that process, pretrial services is involved and they're not
necessarily privy to the terms of our agreement.  And I
understand that we've added some things that were not part of
the agreement, and I'm fine with that.  But there's one
condition I'm not fine with and I'd like your Honor to
consider.

With regards to the surrender of firearm, I'm asking
that your Honor not make that a requirement of her release.  I
ask that because - in this nonviolent allegation, in which no
firearm was involved, with a history of having no criminal
record of any kind or any history of violence - she, who
legally possesses and has a permit for the firearm, should
still be able to possess her firearm because she's not a
convicted felon and someone who's not permitted to do so.
She's --
THE COURT:  Is that a duty firearm or personal use?
MR. FOY:  Personal.
So that's the only issue that I have, because I think
that at this time, to sacrifice that right that she legally
has, and has complied with everything that it means to have
that firearm, that she still be able to do so.  I could imagine
that there could be an argument about safety of others;
however, there's nothing to really corroborate the fact that
her continuing to possess her firearm, just like she has in the
past, would actually endanger anyone.  We voluntarily
surrendered.  We participated in a pretrial interview.  There's
just no reason for it, other than probably a policy that says
that's what they would like to do.
Now, it's a meaningful one, I'm not saying that it's a
bad thing, but under the unique circumstances here, in this
case, in the history and type of case that it is, I'm asking

that that one condition be withheld and with all the other
conditions being fine.
THE COURT:  Just so I understand your argument, you
would like your client to retain her personal-use firearm
because she otherwise has the right to do so?  She doesn't need
it for any particular reason?
MR. FOY:  Well, I suppose a person who has a firearm
may feel that they need it for their self-protection.  Now, I'm
not suggesting that there's been some specific threat or
anything, other than the world is crazy, but if she hasn't done
anything improper with regards to that important right, it
shouldn't be sacrificed now, at an arraignment, as a condition
of her release, when she has fully cooperated with everything
up until this point.  We've been in communication with the
government since August 14th, and communicated about her
international travel since this investigation began.  All we've
done is comply and put the government on notice as to her
whereabouts and what's going on.  We've been completely
cooperative in that respect.
But when you talk about removing someone's personal
firearm, that they legally possess in their home - she doesn't
have a license to carry it anywhere, just in her home - unless
there is a reason connected to the case, to the crime, that
suggests that it could be in fact a danger to a third party or
someone else, then, in that case, I would understand, but not

in this kind of case, which is an allegation about documents.
THE COURT:  Understood.  Thank you.
I have a few responses.  The first is, although I
greatly appreciate when the parties are able to reach agreement
on the terms of a defendant's release, that agreement is
meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling.  I
ultimately decide how defendants should be released.  And there
have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement
between the parties.  So the fact that you and the government
reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be
imposed may be different than that agreement.  It's simply, the
way that court proceeds.  And the fact of the agreement - while
very helpful and I appreciate it, and it suggests that the
parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean
that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.
The second thing to say with respect to the issue of
firearms is that it is in fact a policy.  It's not a policy of
the U.S. Attorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial
service office, because they are going to be sending officers
in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you
said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety
concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety
concerns about Ms. Noel.  And, as you point out, this case is
not a violent case and there are not allegations that your
client has engaged in violence, either in connection with this

case or in her history, but I need to be concerned about
sending law enforcement officers who work for the Court, who
are going to be supervising your client, and it is for their
safety that we impose that condition.
So I am going to impose the condition.  I am going to
require your client to surrender her firearm.  Both defendants
will have to surrender their firearms and their permits so that
they can't secure new firearms.  That is a safety precaution
that we undertake to protect our people who are going to be
enforcing the terms of this release.  It has nothing to do with
the government per se.
So with that, I will release the defendants today on
their own signature and the posting of $100,000 bond that needs
to be secured by two financially responsible cosigners.
You're going to report, each of you, to your pretrial
officer, as directed.
I believe you've surrendered your travel documents,
your passports, and the like.  If you haven't, you need to
surrender your travel documents, and you're prohibited from
making any new travel applications.
Each of you is prohibited from having contact with the
other, meaning your codefendant, except in the presence of
counsel.  As I just stated, each of you needs to surrender any
firearms, both personal use and duty firearms, and the permits
that authorize those, to pretrial.

With respect to travel for Mr. Thomas, your travel
will be restricted to the Southern District of New York, the
Eastern District of New York, and the District of New Jersey.
And for Ms. Noel, your travel will be restricted to
the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the District of
New Jersey and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
In addition, I'm imposing the requirement for
Mr. Thomas that he refrain from the excessive use of alcohol,
and, for Ms. Noel, the requirement that she -- I'm going to
give the authority to pretrial to determine whether or not a
mental health evaluation or support is needed, but that will be
at the direction of your pretrial services officer.
Let me warn each of you that if you fail to appear in
court or if you violate any of the conditions of your release,
a warrant will be issued for your arrest, and you and anybody
who cosigned the bond may be responsible for paying its full
amount, which is $100,000, and you will be charged with a
separate crime of bail-jumping.
In addition, if you commit an offense while you're on
pretrial supervision, you may be subject to a more severe
punishment than you would receive if you committed the very
same offense at any other time.
Has Judge Torres set the next conference date?
MR. ROOS:  Yes, your Honor.  The judge set it for
November 25, 2019.

And the government would move to exclude time between
today's date and that date so that the government may produce
discovery and the defense may begin to review the discovery.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Any objections from defense counsel?
MR. FOY:  No, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  No, Judge.  I think there is just an
issue of the timing of the court date.  The time --
THE COURT:  You should just reach out to Judge Torres'
deputy.  I'm sure, if necessary, it can be rescheduled.  For
now, I'm going to exclude time, on defendants' consent, from
today to November 25th.
Anything further from either side?
MR. ROOS:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
MR. FOY:  No, thank you, your Honor.
MR. FIGGINS:  No, Judge.  Thank you.
