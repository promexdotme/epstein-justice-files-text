Narrative 
On 11/24/05 at about 21:49 hours I went to 
 reference to a 
suspicious person. I met wit
who stated she has two juvenile daughters. 
Tonight she noticed they went across the street to a vacant house with some boys. When she 
went to check on them she caught the boys drinking alcohol. She knew the boys were juveniles 
so she took the alcohol (tequila) from them she said a couple of the boys ran off. Juvenile one 
got in his silver Mitsubishi and went to the end of the street. He then stopped infront of her 
house. The juvenile stated he wanted his tequila back and he would come back at midnight 
Mrs.
is concerned juvenile one might return and damage her guests vehicles. Mrs. 
asked her juveniles who the subject was and they were unfamiliar. I gave Mrs. 
a case card. I returned into service with no further incident. I informed morning watch 
of this address for an extra patrol for tonight only.

Narrative 
While on patrol, I was dispatched to a missing person call a
 arrived 
and made contact with the caller/mother of the missing juvenile female, _ 	" J. She 
stated her juvenile daughter left yesterday for school, and had not returned. - 	
l told me she 
had spoken with her daughter around 1900 and she was going to the high school basketball 
game. Later on that night, some of the juveniles's friends called the mother and informed her 
they had not seen the juvenile at the game. 
When the juvenile didn't return this morning, - 	
said she became worried and started to 
contact some of her daughters friends. They told her they heard she was handing hanging 
around with Mr. Byron Elrod in an area known as "The Cut" which is located off Old Donaldson 
and Highway 140. "The Cut" is a known drug area in the county. I completed a missing person's 
checklist and obtained a recent picture of the juvenile. I called Detective Allen and informed her 
of the situation. The mother did not want a juvenile complaint filed. I issued - 	
a case card 
and asked her to call if she found any more information regarding her daughter. D/S Ballard and 
I left the residence and returned to service. 
After patrolling Old Donaldson Rd and the Crissler Street area, we were unable to locate any 
additional information as to the whereabouts of the female. Around 1200, I received a telephone 
call from 	
stating that she had found her daughter, and she was located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments off Bells Ferry Rd. The mother told me a friend of the family was going to pick the 
female up, and escort her back to the parents house. I told - 	
to call 911 when her daughter 
returned and a deputy would be sent out to check on the well being of the juvenile. 
When the juvenile returned Sgt Thompson met with the juvenile and parents at the house. The 
Juvenile stated she had been drinking and had done some drugs fast night, and that she had 
been scared to call her parents. She then went to a friends house located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments and spent the night.

and he was taking a report of a missing juvenile age 15. He stated she was supposed to have 
went to a basketball game last night but she didn't. He stated she went off with some black 
males. He told they were stopped by some white friends of her and they fought with the black 
males. WS Ballard said the mother had contact with her daughter around 8:00 last night but 
had not heard from her since then.

AL 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home 
by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a 
burglary had been reported at 358 81 Brillo. I responded to the 
scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up 
the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process 
the crime scene 
I went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. 
Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west 
end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with 
the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two 
story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim 
is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with 
metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch 
pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops 
of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals 
approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. 
The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way 
leading to a three car garage. 
The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage 
two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on 
them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The 
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was 
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west 
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep 
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with 
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk 
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra 
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any 
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have 
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None 
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was 
79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small 
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer 
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been 
touched or tampered with. 
On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr. 
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the 
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer 
room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass 
windows present. The eastern most and western most are 
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has 
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of 
14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a 
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was 
found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did 
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The 
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism 
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to 
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were 
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the 
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a 
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a 
rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central 
window. 
Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is 
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The 
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on 
the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The 
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash 
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar 
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen 
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of net. 
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned 
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the 
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for 
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found 
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters 
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a 
supplement to that effect that will follow.

on 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to 
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video 
footage of the suspect burglar. 
Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at 
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before 
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein 
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk 
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto 
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a 
property receipt3 
At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers 
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm 
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed 
several video cameras on the outside of the building and 
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the 
building.

At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager 
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the 
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach 
identification card application. 
At 1630 hours, i called the Towers Condominium and 
spoke with the manager of the condominium who 
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement. 
Dement gave me his direct business number 
561-833-8170, and his home phone number 
561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar 
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't 
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several 
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance 
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday 
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes. 
Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight 
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and 
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door 
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement 
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to 
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on 
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with 
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he 
advised that he would check and call me back in the 
morning.

On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into 
the police department and informed me that earlier today he met 
with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm 
Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph 
obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi 
admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi 
told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that 
Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the 
gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having 
problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun 
because he was contemplating suicide. 
Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the 
stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi 
to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of 
Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that 
Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would 
make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to 
be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute 
Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said 
he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi 
said he does not have it. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein 
and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of 
the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

building, 1515 South Flager Drive, at approximately 2:00 a.m. 
Mrs. Alessi stated she contacted West Palm Beach Police Department 
via 911, and officer's responded. I contacted the West Palm Beach 
Police Department which queried their CAD system and confirmed 
Officer Sean Phillips responded to that address in reference to a 
911 phone call. There is no report on file and list said CAD 
entry only that Juan P. Alessi was in the building reference to a 
civil matter, They have no current information for Mr. Alessi.

On 10/13/03, Det. Pagan and I went to 1515 So. Flagler 
Drive, Apt. #1901, West Palm Beach, Florida, in an 
attempt to locate suspect Juan Alessi. As we were 
getting into the elevator on the ground floor, we came in 
contact with Alessi's wife, Marie Alessi. I explained to 
Marie why we were there and she agreed to speak to us. 
Marie said she and her husband, Juan Alessi, have been 
separated for approximately two months and they are 
going through divorce proceedings. Marie said Juan no 
longer lives with her at this address and she has a court 
order which states Juan is to have no contact with her. 
Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours, 
Juan drove by her as she was walking out of the Ross 
Department Store located on the southeast corner of 
Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan 
waved at her and that was the extent of their contact. 
Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She 
said he is driving a white Caravan. Marie supplied me 
with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie 
advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their 
separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her 
surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she 
comes in contact with him to call the police 
immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's 
phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645. 
I called Juan Alessi on hie cell phone. Juan agreed to 
come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview. 
Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him 
in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read 
Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in 
which he stated he understood and signed . 
I asked Juan what his connection was with Mr. Epstein,

he lives at: 358 El Brillo. Juan said he worked for Mr. 
Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as 
the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with 
Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked 
Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the 
past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did 
take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained 
approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed 
about hie break up with his wife along with a cancerous 
medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he 
became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. 
Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. 
Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. 
Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver 
revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan 
did not know the exact date, but he eaid it was 
approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a 
Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's 
house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the 
gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it 
in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the 
house through an unlocked sliding glass door located 
near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office 
and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched 
the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then 
went into Epstein's briefcase and removed 
approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he 
immediately left the house. 
Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at 
approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 
El Brillo in order to steal money once again from 
Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white 
Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan 
entered the house through the sliding glass door and 
entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase 
and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said he left through the same 
glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he 
wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a 
short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did 
not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the 
money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers. 
I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was 
not and that he was seeing a psychologist an a weekly 
basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan 
once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house. 
Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03, 
and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the 
money that was taken,

On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan 
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers 
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's 
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag 
U72UGL. 
On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met 
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money 
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time. 
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and 
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had 
denied taking the Glock hand gun. 
In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location 
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the 
books behind hie desk. The surveillance video does not show 
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun. 
On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution 
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that 
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with 
mailing the original back to me for my case file. 
At 1500 hours, net. Recarey removed the video surveillance 
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo. 
Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution 
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met 
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that 
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at 
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan 
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS; Please show a full recovery of the U.S. 
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.

Entered By.: OREGERO, LAURA D. 	
10/06/03 
On Sunday 10/5/03 at approximately 0824 hours, 
was dispatched to a burglary at 358 El Brillo Way. Upon 
arrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white 
male, dob/012053. Epstein advised he and his personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/052579, arrived in 
the residence on Friday evening, 10/3/03. Epstein advised 
that on Saturday evening 10/4/01, he left his briefcase at his 
desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein 
said when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately 
$5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100 
bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase. 
Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday, 
10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had 
been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein 
believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase. 
Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was 
sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black 
Glock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind 
his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been 
taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was 
in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day 
weekend Aug. 30-Sept 1, 2003. The second time was a 
weekend in mid September, 2003. Epstein stated he did not

report these incidents because he was not sure the money 
was accounted for. Possible footage of the incident may 
exist. I next met with Kellen who advised she went to bed at 
approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see 
anything unusual through the night or on the morning of 
10/5/03. Cotrin, the resident chef advised that he went to 
bed at approximately 1030 pm on 10/4/03 and began work at 
approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03. Cotrin stated that he did 
not see or hear anything unusual from the staff residence 
locate don the east side of the property. I next spoke to Mike 
and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike 
stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately 
8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm 
same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said 
he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on 
10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated 
that she checked the exterior of the residence at 
approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties. 
Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything 
appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at 
approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30 
on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie 
Friedman have been employed as the house managers since 
9/24/03. Prior to them, the live on site house managers were 
Patrick and Evelyn, Epstein was unsure of the last name. 
Patrick Evelyn were employed at 358 El Brillo approximately 
9 months. Prior to the house manager was John Alessi who 
was employee at 358 El Brillo approximately 10 years. 
Epstein signed an affidavit of prosecution, it is attached to 
this report. Crime Scene manager Parkinson responded and 
processed the scene. Det. Melnichok also responded. See 
Det. Melnichok's report for further information. Officer Nault 
responded and conducted a neighborhood canvas which is 
also attached to this report. It should be noted that Epstein 
will contact Palm Beach Police Department with the serial 
number of the stolen handgun so that it may be entered into 
FCIC.

reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during 
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who 
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53. 
Epstein told me that over the )apt couple of months, when he 
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on 
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the 
amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on 
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a 
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. 
Epstein then placed $4,000. in d.s. currency, one hundred dollar 
bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does 
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the 
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up 
and twice to have $100. missinglfrom the bag and the suspects 
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there 
were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope 
and that nothing else in the hoUse appeared to be disturbed by the 
suspect. 
Epstein took me to the computeroom where he showed me a computer 
monitor that was displaying a sill frame of the suspect. The 
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into 
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and 
then opened the center drawer td the desk. It appeared as though 
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein 
told me that he did not know whd the suspect in the photo was 
but thought it might be his forMer houseman because of his size 
and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the 
video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman

that he had limited working 
ould contact the company who 
had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. 
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. 
Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told 
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry 
into the house from the slidingglass doors on the south side 
of the house but not the west aside of house because he had 
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. 
It is believed that the suspectlalso left the house by the 
same sliding door that was unlo ked as there were no pry marks 
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed 
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm 
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could 
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this 
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee

AL 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home 
by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a 
burglary had been reported at 358 El Grillo. I responded to the 
scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up 
the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process 
the crime scene. 
went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. 
Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west 
end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with 
the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two 
story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim 
is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with 
metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch 
pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops 
of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals 
approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. 
The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The 
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was 
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west 
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep 
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with 
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk 
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra 
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any 
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have 
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None 
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was 
79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small 
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer 
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been 
touched or tampered with. 
On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr. 
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the 
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer 
room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass 
windows present. The eastern most and western most are 
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has 
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of 
14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a 
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was 
found ajar, however the eandy area directly outside of the door did 
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The 
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism 
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to 
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were 
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the 
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a 
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a 
rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central 
window. 
Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is 
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The 
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on 
the sbuthern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The 
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash 
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar 
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen 
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of net. 
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned 
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the 
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for 
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found 
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters 
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a 
supplement to that effect that will follow.

Entered By.: GREENE, LINDA C. 	
46. 
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video 
footage of the suspect burglar. 
Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at 
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before 
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein 
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk 
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto 
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a 
property receipt. 
At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers 
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm 
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed 
several video cameras on the outside of the building and 
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the 
building. 
At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager 
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the 
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach 
identification card application. 
At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and 
spoke with the manager of the condominium who 
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement. 
Dement gave me his direct business number 
561-833-8170, and his home phone number 
561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar 
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't 
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several 
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance 
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday 
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes. 
Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight 
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and 
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door 
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement 
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to 
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on 
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with 
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he 
advised that he would check and call me back in the 
morning.

On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into 
the police department and informed me that earlier today he met 
with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm 
Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph 
obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi 
admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi 
told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that 
Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the 
gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having 
problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun 
because he was contemplating suicide. 
Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the 
stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi 
to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of 
Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that 
Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would 
make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to 
be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute 
Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said 
he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi 
said he does not have it. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein 
and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of 
the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

building, 1515 South Flager Drive, at approximately 2:00 a.m. 
Mrs. Alessi stated she contacted West Palm Beach Police Department 
via 911, and officer's responded. I contacted the West Palm Beach 
Police Department which queried their CAD system and confirmed 
Officer Sean Phillips responded to that address in reference to a 
911 phone call. There is no report on file and list said CAD 
entry only that Juan P. Alessi was in the building reference to a 
civil matter. They have no current information for Mr. Alessi.

On 10/13/03, Det. Pagan and I went to 1515 So. Flagler 
Drive, Apt. #1901, West Palm Beach, Florida, in an 
attempt to locate suspect Juan Alessi. As we were 
getting into the elevator on the ground floor, we came in 
contact with Alessi's wife, Marie Alessi. I explained to 
Marie why we were there and she agreed to speak to us. 
Marie said she and her husband, Juan Alessi, have been 
separated for approximately two months and they are 
going through divorce proceedings. Marie said Juan no 
longer lives with her at this address and she has a court 
order which states Juan is to have no contact with her. 
Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours, 
Juan drove by her as she was walking out of the Ross 
Department Store located on the southeast corner of 
Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan 
waved at her and that was the extent of their contact. 
Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She 
said he is driving a white Caravan. Marie supplied me 
with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie 
advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their 
separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her 
surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she 
comes in contact with him to call the police 
immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's 
phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645. 
I called Juan Alessi on his cell phone. Juan agreed to 
come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview. 
Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him 
in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read 
Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in

Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as 
the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar _with 
Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. u asked 
Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the 
past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did 
take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained 
approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed 
about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous 
medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he 
became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. 
Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. 
Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. 
Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver 
revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan 
did not know the exact date, but he said it was 
approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a 
Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's 
house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the 
gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it 
in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the 
house through an unlocked eliding glass door located 
near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office 
and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched 
the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then 
went into Epstein's briefcase and removed 
approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan sai after taking the money he 
immediately left the house 5 
Onan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at 
approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 
El Brillo in order to steal money once again from 
Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white 
Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan 
entered the house through the sliding glass door and 
entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase 
and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said he left through the same 
glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he 
wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a 
short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did 
not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the 
money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers. 
I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was 
not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly 
basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan 
once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house.

taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time 
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and 
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had 
denied taking the Glock hand gun. 
In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location 
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the 
books behind hie desk. The surveillance video does not show 
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun. 
On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution 
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that 
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with 
mailing the original back to me for my case file. 
At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance 
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo. 
Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution 
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met 
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that 
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at 
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan 
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.

Center from Cingular Wireless for telephone number 561-308-0282. This 
was the telly number for Haley Robson during the time frame when 
the victim, 	
was brought to the Epstein house to "work." 	
An 
analysis of the phone records, of all incoming and outgoing calls, 
showed that on February 6, 2005, the day the victim, 41110 was brought 
to the house, Robson first called Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, 
at 917-855-3363at 12:50 pm (EST). The next call was made to Epstein's 
house in Palm Beach, at 12:52 pm (EST). The following call was made 
to the victim, 	
at 1:01 pm (EST) and at 1:02 pm (EST). This 
confirms the information provided by the victim and victim's father. 
I photo copied the records and enlarged the page 8 of 10 to show the 
calls made by Robson on February 6, 2005.

parents. I 
will attempt to establish contact with them during the evening hours.

delivered at the police station. Within the package, was a letter 
from Alan Dershowitz, and two www.myspace.com profiles. The profiles 
were that of

MySpace.com is a social 
networking service that allows members to create unique personal 
profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new 
friends. This package was in response to a previous meeting in which 
Mr. Dershowitz called to assist in the investigation in providing any 
\dditional witnesses such as house employees who have been reluctant 
o speak with law enforcement. 
I reviewed the pr files Mr. Dershowitz enclosed.

(The letter Mr. Dershowitz sent advised he was looking into the 
allegation that one of the private investigators used by the private
