Fed.Prac. & Proc. Civ. 3d §1280 Effect of Failure to Deny - Privilege Against Self-
Incrimination (" ... court must treat the defendant's claim of privilege as equivalent to a 
specific denial."). See also 24 Fla.Jur.2d Evidence §592. Defendants in civil actions. -
" ... a civil defendant who raises an affirmative defense is not precluded from asserting 
the privilege [against self-incrimination], because affirmative defenses do not constitute 
the kind of voluntary application for affirmative relief" which would prevent a plaintiff 
bringing a claim seeking affirmative relief from asserting the privilege. 
4. As to the allegations is paragraph 4, Defendant is without knowledge as to 
whether "Ms. DOE II is a natural person residing in Palm Beach County, Florida," and 
denied the same. As to the remainder of the allegations, Defendant realleges and 
adopts his response in paragraph 3 above herein. 
5. As to the allegations in paragraph 5, Defendant asserts his Fifth Amendment 
privilege against self-incrimination. See Delisi v. Bankers Ins. Company, 436 So.2d

Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause applies to the states through the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - "[i]t would be incongruous to have different

WHEREFORE Defendant requests that this Court deny all relief sought by Plaintiff. 
Affirmative Defenses 
1. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and was a willing participant 
in the acts alleged, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to 
be reduced accordingly. 
2. As to the claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and participated in conduct similar 
and/or identical to the acts alleged with other persons which were the sole or 
contributing cause of Plaintiff's alleged damages. 
3. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff impliedly consented to the acts alleged by not 
objecting, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be 
reduced accordingly.

4. As to Plaintiff's claim, Defendant reasonably believed or was told that the Plaintiff 
had attained the age of 18 years old at the time of the alleged acts. 
5. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff's claims are barred as she said she was 18 years 
or older at the time. 
6. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff's alleged damages were caused in whole or part 
by events and/or circumstances completely unrelated to the incident(s) alleged in the 
complaint. 
7. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
8. Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and can not show a 
violation of a predicate act under the applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) -the 
version in effect prior to the 2006 amendment, eff. Jul. 27, 2006. 
9. As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time 
of the alleged conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount 
should Plaintiff prove the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any 
multiplier. 
10. As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, Plaintiff is entitled to only a single recovery of her 
actual damages. 
Should Plaintiff prove actual damages in an amount less than 
$50,000, the applicable statutory minimum, she is entitled to a single recovery of 
$50,000, regardless of the number of acts. Allowing a multiplication of the damages 
recoverable would be in violation of the prohibition against the recovery of duplicative 
damages.

11.As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, effective July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against 
retroactive application of an amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional 
principles, including but not limited to, the "Ex Post Facto" Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, 
§9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1, and procedural and substantive due process, U.S. Const. 14th 
Amend., 5th Amend. The statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct applies. 
12.As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, effective July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the 
Rule of Lenity. A criminal statute is required to give " 'fair warning ... in language that 
the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is 
passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.' " United 
States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259,265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting 
McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)) 
(omission in original). The "three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement" 
are: (1) the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or 
requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must 
necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict 
construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving 
ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered; (3) due 
process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct 
that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its 
scope.

13. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of 
a "minor." Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and 
accordingly, her cause of action is barred. 
14.Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in 
violation of the constitutional principles of due process, the "Ex Post Facto" clause, and 
the Rule of Lenity, in that in amending the term "minor" to "person" as to those who may 
bring a cause of action impermissibly and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of 
persons able to bring a §2255 claim. 
15. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment 
under the U.S. Constitution, and thus Plaintiff's claim thereunder is barred. 
16. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and 
substantive due process. Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without notice and opportunity to be heard. 
Substantive due process protects fundamental rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff's cause of 
action thereunder is barred. 
WHEREFORE Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief sought by Plaintiff.
