MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There are no PC

There was originally an 
Indictment, the second charge was filed 
arising out of the booking. 
It was all 
testimony presented to the grand jury. 
THE COURT: 
Let me see the Indictment 
then? 
I have one Indictment, one 
Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct.

THE COURT: 
So one case is charged by 
Indictment, one is charged by Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct.

In case 2006036744 you 
are charged with procuring a person under

felony, maximum penalty of fifteen years

No mandatory minimum

Yes.

And the guideline score

client to community control, sex offender 
status. 
THE COURT: 
I understand. 
Okay. 
What is proposed -- those 
are the maximums and minimums, Mr. Epstein. 
What is proposed is that you will be 
pleading guilty to felony solicitation to 
prostitution and procuring a person under 
18 for prosecution. 
A PSI would be waived, 
you would be adjudicated guilty of both 
felonies, is that correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
And on 06 9454, the 
defendant to be sentenced to 12-months in 
the Palm Beach County 
detention 
facility? 
He's going to do time in the 
jail? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes.

THE COURT: 
With credit for one day 
served. 
And on 08 9381, he is to be 
sentenced to six months in the Palm Beach 
County jail detention facility, with credit 
for one day served. 
And the six month 
sentence is to be served consecutive to the 
12 month sentence?

MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
Following the six months 
sentence, the defendant will be placed on 
12-months of community control one. 
The 
conditions of the community control are 
attached hereto and incorporated herein. 
As a special condition of 
community control, he's to have no 
unsupervised contact with minors and the 
supervising adult must be approved -- and I 
would say, pre-approved, approved ahead of 
time, not after the fact by the Department 
of Corrections. 
And you would mean by that 
his community control officer? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
The defendant is 
designated as a sexual offender pursuant to 
Florida Statute 943.0435 and must abide by 
all the corresponding requirements of the 
statute, a copy of which is attached hereto 
and incorporated herein. 
The defendant 
must provide a DNA sample in court at the 
time of this plea. 
Is this the --
and the 
attachments are the terms and conditions of 
community control.

Statute 948.101, Mr. Epstein, is that

Actually Your Honor, 
the agreement of the parties is to, it's 
community control one which is not monitor. 
THE COURT: 
Oh, community control 
one, is that spelled out in here? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, it is, Your

I can go through

None of the them appear

These are the

standard conditions of community control by 
statute would apply to anyone that goes on 
community control and out of an abundance 
of caution, we simply memorialized those 
standard conditions in the plea sheet 
agreement.

intensive supervision and surveillance for 
an offender placed on community control

specified contact with the parole and

PROBATION OFFICER: 
Specified by you, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
I don't see that in the 
plea sheet. 
That's why I'm asking the 
questions. 
No one has specified how often, 
how frequently he is to have contact with 
his parole and probation officer. 
Confinement to an agreed upon residence 
during the ·hours away from employment and. 
public service activity, has that been 
articulated? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I believe 
Judge Mcsorley has a standard order 
somewhere on the bench up there regarding 
this, I'm told by the prosecutor. 
MS. LENHARDT: 
Judge, usually this is 
the probation sheet she hands out to folks. 
THE COURT: 
I have seen those 
sheets --
I have seen them incorporated in 
plea agreements which is why I'm asking. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I see. 
THE COURT: 
Is there some reason you 
didn't use this particular document in this 
case?

this just unspecified.

that Judge Mcsorley normally uses.

latitude given the court in putting 
somebody on community control. 
If you

agree to some change, let me know, but 
understand at the outset that I'm a big fan 
of specificity. 
I want to know what he 
will be doing for employment. 
I want to 
know exactly where he is going to.be living 
and I want it on the record now. 
It can 
change but it can only change with 
preapproval by DOC. 
I want it crystal

I don't want the community control 
officer who gets this case the day he walks 
out the Palm Beach County to have any doubt 
or confusion as to exactly what this 
defendant is supposed to do, where he is 
supposed to be when, exactly what I am 
requesting that officer to supervise.

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, we are 
back on Jeffrey Epstein, actually it 
worked, we had an opportunity to go through 
Judge McSorley's conditions of community 
control and we asked the Department of 
Corrections representative to assist us to 
make sure we did everything properly. 
They were very helpful and we executed the 
document. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes, and Your Honor, 
this defendant doesn't fall under the sex 
offender probation but we have included 
special sex offender conditions as part of 
the community control and they are all 
circled there. 
THE COURT: 
The plea agreement stated 
the defendant is designated as a sexual 
offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
942.035. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
But the 
sex offender probation, the statute is 
different and only applies to certain 
offenses and this one was not enumerated.

Okay.

Correct.

Correct.

And we will talk about 
MR. GOLDBERGER:

But it is not the one

that requires the special conditions of sex 
offender probation?

Correct.

Now, rather than 948, do 
you want me to disregard 948? 
He's read 
it? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
He's read it.

We will leave it in 
there. 
But these conditions we are going 
to go over right now are going to be viewed 
in my mind, yes, and they have been signed 
by the defendant and we will go over that

officer. 
B, you will maintain an hourly 
accounting of all your activities on a

log, maybe I'm just confused from other 
cases I've heard, is the daily log is a 
weekly log, I guess it is submitted ahead 
of time, is that correct?

That is correct,

So part A, where he has 
to stay in his residence except for one 
hour before and after the approved

other activity.

THE COURT: 
Okay. 
for whatever reason 
Should he not be 
18-months is a long 
time, should he not be owning that 
residence or able to reside there, he will 
have the obligation of notifying his 
probation officer prior, and I emphasize 
this, prior to his release from custody. 
I 
assume that the department will be notified 
prior to, to his release?

All address --
I assume 
all of this to and from work and any other 
approved activities restricts him to Palm 
Beach County, is that correct? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
So let's be clear, 
everything, from the day he walks out 
18 
occurs in Palm Beach County, is that clear? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We understand, Your 
Honor. 
That's correct. 
THE COURT: 
Then the additional 
condition of his probation, they are not 
sex offender standard conditions, they are 
just conditions that are being imposed 
especially in this case? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
They are as follows, you 
shall submit to a mandatory curfew from 10 
p.m. to 6:00 a.m. regardless of any other 
restrictions regarding work or approved 
activity, there will be no exceptions to 
being at home in house from 10 p.m. to 6

If the victim was under 
age of 18 years which I gather is the case 
because it's circled, you shall not live 
within 1000 feet of a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
where children regularly congregate. 
Has someone verified that 358 El 
Brillo is such a place? 
19 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
No, but that will be 
done prior to his release. 
THE COURT: 
So 358 El Brillo will not 
be approved if it should happen to be one 
thousand feet from a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
this is rather open. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Where children 
gather. 
THE COURT: 
Where children regularly 
congregate. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Right.

are there areas there where children

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We have done our due 
diligence, for what it's worth, there is a 
residential street. 
There are not children 
congregating on that street. 
We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Dis, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There's several. 
THE COURT: 
Several, all of the 
victims. 
So this should be plural. 
I'm 
making that plural. 
You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this 
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. 
By 
indirect, we mean no text messages, no 
e-mail, no Face Book, no My Space, no 
telephone calls, no voice mails, no

any of these victims with a message of any

THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am 
THE COURT: 
And then it states, 
unless approved by the victim, the 
therapist and the sentencing court. 
Okay. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
I understand. 
THE COURT: 
And the sentencing court. 
So, if there is a desire which, I would 
think would be a bit strange to have 
contact with any of the victims the court 
must approve it. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
If the victim was under 
the age of 18, which was the case, you 
shall not until you have successfully 
attended and completed the sex offender 
program. 
So, is this sex offender program 
becoming a condition of probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
That is not. 
I 
don't believe I circled that one.

It was the agreement 
of the parties, Your Honor. 
We just 
decided that was the best way to accomplish 
what needed to be done here and the parties 
agreed that that sentence satisfied 
everyone's requirements.

The taxpayers of Palm 
Beach County is going to pay 18 months to

And this registration 
occurs when?

Within 48-hours of 
release.

the Palm Beach County jail, he needs to 
register?

who 
is going to provide him with the form?

He actually 
registers out at the Sheriff's Office, Your 
Honor, we can do it out there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
It has been 
brought to my attention that FDLE is the 
one who is statutorily required to handle 
these registrations but some of our 
municipal jurisdictions have taken it upon 
themselves to impose additional 
requirements, y'all understand that?

he has to do is the official State of 
Florida registration? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein, I need to 
make sure you understand that that's what's 
required by this plea. 
Anyone on 
probation, community control is required to 
live and abide by the laws. 
So if a 
jurisdiction you choose to reside in should 
have some additional municipal requirements 
you will be required in order to comply 
with the law of living there, just like you 
can't get a parking ticket or speeding 
ticket, to comply with those regulations 
but I want to make sure you understand 
because I have seen some defendants who 
have been confused about this. 
If you 
don't, for example, if the Town of Palm 
Beach has you register that does not take 
care of your requirement. 
Your requirement 
to register with FDLE through the Sheriff's 
office is separate, distinct and must be 
done on their form according to their 
schedule. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am.

THE COURT: 
And if my experience the 
last few months is of any value, they are 
very serious about enforcing this. 
They 
will be tracking you for the rest of your 
life. 
Do not move. 
Do not go --
I don't 
care when you are done with community 
control, they need to know exactly where 
35 
you are and if you go anywhere without 
registering, they will find and you will be 
locked up. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Any questions 
about that? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
No, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Did you read the plea in 
the circuit court form that describes all 
the rights you are giving up by entering 
this plea? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
I think I asked you 
before, can you read? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
Are you under the 
influence of alcohol, drugs or medication

THE COURT: 
Defendant needs to 
approach as well. 
(Whereupon, there was a conference at 
the bench.) 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
The reason why I 
asked to come sidebar, there is a 
nonprosecution agreement with the United 
States Attorney's office that triggers as a 
result of this plea agreement. 
In other 
words, they have signed off and said they 
will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the 
Southern District of Florida for any 
offense upon his successful taking of this 
plea today. 
That is a confidential 
document that the parties have agreed to. 
Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted 
to tell the court. 
THE COURT: 
I understand, that would 
also be invalidated should he violate his 
community control?

Absolutely.

THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein needs to come 
closer. 
Mr. Epstein, 
your attorney has 
told me that in addition to everything, we 
talked about another Inducement, shall we 
say, to your taking this plea is that the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, 
has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement 
with you, meaning that if you successfully 
complete probation and do everything you're 
supposed to, they have, have agreed not to 
prosecute you federally, did you understand 
that? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
And I would view that as 
a significant inducement in accepting this 
plea. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
They are actually in 
court here today, also.

THE COURT: 
I find a sufficient 
factual basis to support the pleas. 
Are all of the victims in both of 
these cases in agreement with the terms of 
this plea? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I have spoken to 
several myself and I have spoken to 
counsel, through counsel as to the other 
victim, and I believe, yes. 
THE COURT: 
And with regard to the 
victims under age eighteen, is that 
victim's parents or guardian in agreement 
with the plea? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
That victim is not 
under age 18 any more and that's why we 
spoke with her counsel.

with the plea? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes.

454 AMB, and 
procuring a person under 18 for 
prostitution, a second degree felony 08 CF 
009381AMB. 
With respect to the solicitation 
of prosecution, I will sentence you to 
twelve months in the Palm Beach County 
detention facility with credit for the one 
day served.

With respect to 08 CF 009381, I 
will sentence you to six months in the Palm 
Beach County detention facility, with 
credit for the one day served. 
That six 
month sentence is to be served consecutive 
to the twelve month sentence. 
Following the six month sentence 
you will be placed on 12 months of 
community control. 
That will be on both 
cases, I assume, to run concurrently, 
correct?

THE COURT: 
Okay. 
So only on case 
number 08 CF 009381AMB will you be on one 
year community control which would then 
invoke a potential penalty of fifteen years 
were you to violate. 
The special conditions are that 
you are to have no unsupervised contact 
with minors and the supervising adult must 
be approved by the Department of 
Corrections. 
You are to be designated a 
sexual offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
943.0435 and you must abide by all 
requirements of that statute which I have 
read and we have discussed. 
You will remain confined to your

after your approved employment, community 
service work or other activities approved 
by your probation officer. 
You will

activity on a daily log which you submit to
