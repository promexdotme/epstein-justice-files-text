UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
 
 
 
Case No. 0:16-mc-61262-JEM 
 
In re: SUBPOENA TO  
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS 
 
Underlying Case:  
 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,  
 
 
Plaintiff 
 
v.  
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,  
 
 
Defendant 
 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y) 
 
______________________________/ 
 
MOTION TO SEAL BRADLEY J. EDWARDS’ 
MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,  
FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER  
 
 
Subpoena respondent Bradley J. Edwards, a non-party and attorney for the plaintiff in the 
Giuffre v. Maxwell action, hereby files this motion for leave to file materials under seal for his 
reply in support of his motion to quash.   
 
In his reply to his motion for to quash subpoena, Edwards attached eight exhibits.  Five of 
these exhibits contain a document that is under seal in another court, specifically: 
1. 
Exhibit 1 – Victims Response to Dershowitz Motion to Intervene, under seal in the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida; 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 15     Filed 07/07/16     Page 1 of 3

2. 
Exhibit 3 – Ms. Giuffre’s Motion for Leave to Exceed the Presumptive Ten 
Deposition Limit, the salient portions of which (i.e., the portions relied upon in this case) are under 
seal in the underlying case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; 
3. 
Exhibit 4 – Excerpts from the Confidential Deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell, which 
is under seal in the underlying case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; 
4. 
Exhibit 5 - Excerpts from the Confidential Deposition of Rinaldo Rizzo, which is 
under seal in the underlying case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; and 
5. 
Exhibit 6 – The Opinion of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York (Sweet, J.) in Giuffre v. Maxwell, June 20, 2016, which is under seal in the underlying case 
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
 
In addition, portions of the reply memorandum itself quote from or refer to the sealed 
materials.  Accordingly, a redacted version of the reply memorandum has been prepared for 
inclusion in the public court file, which avoid disclosing the sealed information. 
 
Because the indicated materials are under seal by order of other federal courts, Edwards 
seeks leave to file these materials under seal here.  Edwards has followed the procedures of the 
Southern District of Florida for the handling of sealed materials.   
 
Opposing counsel has simply filed similar materials in this case under seal without seeking 
leave of court.  Accordingly, Edwards believes that opposing counsel would have no objection to 
his filing of similar materials under seal.  Because Edwards believes that a motion is required for 
a sealed filing, he proceeds by way of motion to this Court.

CONCLUSION 
 
For the forgoing reasons, Edwards respectfully requests that this Court allow him to submit 
materials under seal in his reply memorandum supporting his motion to quash.
