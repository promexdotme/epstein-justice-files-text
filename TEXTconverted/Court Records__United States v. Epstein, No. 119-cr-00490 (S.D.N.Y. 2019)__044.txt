I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary repo11s identifying the exact cause of death. An 
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively 
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has 
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter 
as well.

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, 
Warden
