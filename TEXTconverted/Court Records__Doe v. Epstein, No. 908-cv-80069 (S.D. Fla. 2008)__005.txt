Plaintiffs,

----------------------'/ 
MOTION TO INTERVENE AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Applicant, JANE DOE'S MOTHER, individually and as parent and natural guardian of 
JANE DOE NO. 1, by and through the undersigned counsel, moves this Court, pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b ), for leave to intervene as a plaintiff in this action in order 
to assert the claims against Defendant JEFFREY EPSTEIN set forth in Applicant's proposed 
complaint (attached hereto as EXHIBIT "A''). In support of this motion, Applicant states that: 
1. Applicant has claims that share common questions of law or fact with the main action. 
2. Applicant's motion to intervene is timely. 
3. The original parties to this action will not be prejudiced by the intervention of Applicant. 
4. Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1.A.3, counsel for Applicant, in a good faith attempt to resolve 
this dispute, made a reasonable effort to confer with all parties who may be affected by 

Case 9:08-cv-80069-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2008   Page 2 of 3
her intervention in this action. Counsel for Applicant conferred with Counsel for JANE 
DOE'S FATHER, who do not agree to her intervention in this action. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
"' 
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(l)(B), "[o]n timely motion, the court may 
permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a 
common question of law or fact." "Rule 24(b) should be liberally construed. 'Basically, anyone 
may be permitted to intervene if his claim and the main action have a common question of law or 
fact,' unless the court in its 'sound discretion (determines that) the intervention will unduly delay 
or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties."' Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish 
School Bd., 298 F. Supp. 288, 292-93 (D.C. La. 1969) (quoting Allen v. County School Board of 
Prince Edward County, 28 F.R.D. 358,363 (E.D. Va. 1961)) (citation and footnote omitted). 
Applicant, JANE DOE'S MOTHER, is the parent and natural guardian of JANE DOE 
NO. 1. As demonstrated in the attached proposed complaint, Applicant has claims for the same 
causes of action as JANE DOE'S FATHER. Therefore, her claims share common questions of 
law and fact with the main action. Applicant's motion to intervene is timely because it has been 
filed within days of the filing of the initial complaint in this action. And, because this action has 
just been initiated, permitting Applicant to intervene at this stage will not unduly delay the 
proceedings or prejudice the original parties.
