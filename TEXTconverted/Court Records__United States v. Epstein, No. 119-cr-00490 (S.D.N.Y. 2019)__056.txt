Dear Professor Green, 
September 4, 2019 
Thank you for your letter of August 30, 2019. I appreciate your taking the time to clarify 
the record. 
I learned that you had been "retained to provide opinions as an expert on legal ethics" in 
Giuffre v. Dershowitz following the August 27, 2019 public hearing in US v. Epstein. I learned 
of your role in the Giuffre case by reading your affidavit, dated June 7, 2019, which includes 
your legal ethics opinion that David Boies should be disqualified from representing Ms. Giuffre 
in that matter. As you are aware, both Mr. Boies and Ms. Giuffre were invited to testify at the 
August 27, 2019 hearing. 
I remain surprised that your advocacy of Mr. Boies' disqualification from representing 
Ms. Guiffre (in a case obviously related to US v. Epstein) was not disclosed simultaneously with 
your August 26, 2019 Law Journal opinion piece entitled "The Judge in Epstein's Case Should 
Not Tum the Dismissal Into a Drama for the Victims." I am also surprised that you would find 
the August 27, 2019 public hearing to be an inappropriate occasion for transparency in light of 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57 and the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. 
You wrote: "This is an odd moment for transparency in a criminal case."

Finally, it is unfortunate that your opinion piece may have been construed as an effort to 
chill Ms. Giuffre's and Mr. Boies' right to be heard under 18 U.S.C. § 3771 at the August 27, 
2019 public hearing. You wrote: "[W]hatever informational interests the victims may have 
would be served by affording them a chance to attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking 
role."
