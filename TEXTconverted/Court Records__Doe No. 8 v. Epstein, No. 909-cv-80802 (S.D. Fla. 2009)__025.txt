" ... a civil defendant who raises an affirmative defense is not precluded from asserting 
the privilege [against self-incrimination], because affirmative defenses do not constitute 
the kind of voluntary application for affirmative relief' which would prevent a plaintiff

WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief sought by Plaintiff. 
Affirmative Defenses 
1. As to all counts, Plaintiff consented to and was a willing participant in the acts 
alleged, and therefore her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be 
reduced accordingly. 
2. As to all counts alleged, Plaintiff actually consented to and participated in 
conduct similar and/or identical to the acts alleged with other persons which were the 
sole or contributing cause of Plaintiffs alleged damages. 
3. As to all counts, Plaintiff impliedly consented to the acts alleged by not objecting, 
and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be reduced 
accordingly.

Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 7 
4. As to all counts, Defendant reasonably believed or was told that the Plaintiff had 
attained the age of 18 years old at the time of the alleged acts. 
5. As to all counts, Plaintiff's alleged damages were caused in whole or part by 
events or circumstances completely unrelated to the incident alleged in the complaint. 
6. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Plaintiff's 
claims as alleged in Counts I, II, and Ill of the Amended Complaint arose in 2001. 
Plaintiff did not file suit until 2009 - approximately 8 years later - and, thus, her claims 
are time barred. 
7. As to Count I, Plaintiff's claim for assault and battery is time barred under 
§95.11 (3)(o), Fla. Stat., as Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege "abuse" under §39.01, 
Fla. Stat., and thus, §95.11 (7), Fla. Stat., is inapplicable. 
8. As to Count I and Count II, the Counts are duplicative of each other and thus, 
Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action in one or the other. 
9. As to Count Ill, such claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, 18 
U.S.C. §2255(b). 
10. As to Count 111, such claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, 18 
U.S.C. §2255(b). Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege and cannot allege and facts 
that would implicate the doctrine of delayed discovery. 
11.As to Count 111, Plaintiff has failed to and cannot state a cause of action under 18 
U.S.C. §2255, as she has failed to sufficiently and cannot allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§2422, as the requisite predicate act.

Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 8 
12. As to Count 111, Plaintiff has failed to and cannot state a cause of action under 
18 U.S.C. §2255, as she has failed to sufficiently and cannot allege a violation of 18 
U.S.C. §2422. Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege and cannot allege - "using the 
mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly persuade, 
induce or entice ... " JANE DOE NO. 8 in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422(b). 
13.As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault & 
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," such claims are 
subject to the limitations as set forth in §768.72, et seq., Florida Statutes. 
14.As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault & 
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," such claims are 
subject to the constitutional limitations and guideposts as set forth in BMW of North 
America v. Gore, 116 S.Ct 1589 (1996); Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 127 S.Ct. 1057 
(2007); State Farm v. Campbell, 123 S.Ct 1513 (2003); Engle v. Ligget Group, Inc., 945 
So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution and Florida's Constitution, Art. I, §§2 and 9, prohibit the 
imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments 
15.As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault & 
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," the determination of 
whether or not Defendant is liable for punitive damages is required to be bifurcated from 
a determination of the amount to be imposed. 
16. Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for sexual assault and/or battery 
under Count I.

Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 9 
17.As to Count Ill, Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and 
can not show a violation of a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005). 
18.As to Count Ill, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time of the alleged 
conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount should Plaintiff 
prove the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any multiplier. 
19.As to Count Ill, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, effective 
July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against retroactive application of 
an amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional principles, including but 
not limited to, the "Ex Post Facto" Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1, and 
procedural and substantive due process, U.S. Const. 14th Amend., 5th Amend. The 
statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct applies. 
20.As to Count Ill, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, effective 
July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the Rule of Lenity. 
A criminal statute is required to give " 'fair warning ... in language that the common 
world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make 
the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.' " United States v. Lanier, 
520 U.S. 259,265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting McBoyle v. United 
States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)) (omission in original). The 
"three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement" are: (1) the vagueness 
doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an 
act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its 
meaning and differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict construction of criminal 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/17/2009   Page 10 of 11
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 10 
statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal 
statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered; (3) due process bars courts from 
applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor 
any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope. 
21. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of 
a "minor." Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and 
accordingly, her cause of action is barred. 
22. Because Plaintiff has no claim under 18 U.S.C. §2255, this Court is without 
subject matter jurisdiction as to all claims asserted. 
23.Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in 
violation of the constitutional principles of due process, the "Ex Post Facto" clause, and 
the Rule of Lenity, in that in amending the term "minor" to "person" as to those who may 
bring a cause of action impermissibly and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of 
persons able to bring a §2255 claim. 
24. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment 
under the U.S. Constitution, and thus Plaintiff's claim thereunder is barred. 
25. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and 
substantive due process. Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without notice and opportunity to be heard. 
Substantive due process protects fundamental rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff's cause of 
action thereunder is barred.
