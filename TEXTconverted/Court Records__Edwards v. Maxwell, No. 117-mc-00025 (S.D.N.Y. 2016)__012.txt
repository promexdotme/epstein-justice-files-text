Case No. 0:16-mc-61262-JEM 
 
In re: SUBPOENA TO  
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS 
 
Underlying Case:  
 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,  
 
 
Plaintiff 
 
v.  
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,  
 
 
Defendant 
 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y) 
 
______________________________/ 
 
MOTION OF BRADLEY J. EDWARDS TO FILE AN OVER LENGTH  
REPLY IN SUPPORT OF HIS MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA OR,  
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
 
         COME NOW Bradley J. Edwards, by and through undersigned counsel, to file this 
motion for leave to file a reply not to exceed 25 pages in support of his Motion to Quash 
Subpoena or, in the Alternative, for a Protective Order in this action.   
 
As the Court is aware, on June 13, 2016, Bradley J. Edwards filed a twenty page motion 
to quash a subpoena that had been served on him by Defendant Maxwell in connection with a 
complicated case in the Southern District of New York, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-07433-
RWS (S.D.N.Y.).  The motion was supported by seven exhibits.  The Court opened the case as a 
miscellaneous case.

On June 30, 2016, Defendant Maxwell filed a sixteen-page response to the Motion to 
Quash.  The response made allegations about whether Edwards had engaged in proper filings in 
other court cases. The response also suggested that Edwards’s client, Ms. Giuffre, had withheld 
discovery information that she was required to produce in the Southern District of New York.  
The response was supported by 18 exhibits, including 5 exhibits that were under seal.  The 
exhibits total approximately 200 pages in length. 
 
Edwards has now drafted a reply to the response filed by Maxwell.  The reply contains 
nine pages of introductory and factual material and fourteen pages of argument.  The fourteen 
pages of argument are required to fully address the issues raised by Maxwell’s response, 
including discussing recent developments in the underlying case in the Southern District of New 
York.  The subpoena at issue contains multiple sub-parts and a number of complicated issues are 
presented by the requests it contains.   
 
Opposing counsel have been contacted for a position on the motion. Plaintiff will 
supplement this motion once such position has been obtained.
