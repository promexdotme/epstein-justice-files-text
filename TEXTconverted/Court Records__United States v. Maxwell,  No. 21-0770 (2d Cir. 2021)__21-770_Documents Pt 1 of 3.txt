7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-770, Document 1-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page5 of 24

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-770, Document 1-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page9 of 24

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can

80 LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

95 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated

thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine

Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-770, Document 1-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page17 of 24

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge

THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges 
of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.   
On July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant 
was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her 
appearance.  It therefore denied bail.  On December 8, 2020, the Defendant filed a renewed 
motion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December 
14, 2020.  Dkt. No. 96.  On December 28, 2020, the Court denied that motion, concluding that 
the Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her 
appearance.  Dkt. Nos. 104, 106.   
The Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2021.  Dkt. 
No. 160.  In this motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the reasons that the Court

provided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her 
second motion for bail.  Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship, 
and she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be 
monitored by a retired federal judge.  See Dkt. No. 160 at 2.   
As set forth below, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and 
proposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no 
combination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance.  Thus, for substantially the 
same reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the 
Court DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail. 
I. 
Background 
On July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.  
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a 
flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  The 
Defendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
The Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2020.  The Court 
again denied the Defendant’s motion.  In doing so, the Court explained that none of the 
Defendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of 
flight.  It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry 
lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, 
including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s 
substantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for

escape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations 
raised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.  
See Dkt. No. 106.  
On February 23, 2021, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail.  Dkt. No. 
160 (“Def. Mot.”).  The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2021.  Dkt. 
No. 165 (“Gov’t Opp’n”).  The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March 16, 
2021. 
II. 
Legal Standard 
The parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from 
granting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending.  See Gov’t 
Opp’n at 2–3; Reply at 2–3; see also United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(“As a general matter, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—
it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over 
those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omitted).  Under Rule 37(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer 
considering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court 
of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 
37(a).  Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of 
whether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.   
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq.  The Bail Reform Act 
requires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or 
combination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 3 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page3 of 12

 
 
 
4 
person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B).  The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after 
considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that “no condition 
or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and 
the safety of any other person and the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). 
 
After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allows the 
Court to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not known to the movant at the 
time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is 
warranted.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new 
information would not have a material bearing on the issue.  See United States v. Raniere, No. 
18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2018) (noting that 
“[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v. 
Havens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing 
because the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant 
until trial).  In addition, the Court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)’s statutory text.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) 
(noting that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v. 
Petrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).

If, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense 
specifically enumerated in § 3142(e)(3), a rebuttable presumption arises “that no condition or 
combination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the 
community or others.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3).  In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a 
limited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that 
he does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”  United States v. English, 629 
F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 
2001)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) (“[A] defendant must 
introduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).  
Nonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing 
evidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”  English, 629 F.3d at 
319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 
(2d Cir. 1986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).  
Even when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” however, “the presumption favoring 
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed 
by the district court.”  United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290–91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
III. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent powers to review 
its own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of 
the Court’s earlier rulings.  See Def. Mot. at 4.  She also argues that the strength of the 
Government’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions, 
which are currently pending before the Court.  Id. at 7.  Having considered those arguments, the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 5 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page5 of 12

 
 
 
6 
Court’s view has not changed.  The Court again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no 
set of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to 
reasonably assure her appearance.  The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the 
evidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that 
conclusion.  The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.    
A. The Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors has not changed 
To begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.  
See Dkt. No. 106 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7–8.  And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant 
has met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among 
those weighed by the district court.”  Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 
1144).  The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of 
flight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate 
to secure their appearance.”  Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted).   
The Court’s analysis of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors also remains unchanged.  
Because the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor 
victim, the first 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.  
And the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or 
to the community.  The fourth § 3142(g) factor thus weighs against detention.   
With respect to the second § 3142(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter 
the Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.  The Defendant argues that the pre-trial 
motions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire 
indictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 6 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page6 of 12

 
 
 
7 
of the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.”  Def. Mot. at 7.  
Those motions became fully briefed one week ago and are now pending before this Court.  The 
Government strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated 
them.  Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the 
presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength 
and nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.  See Dec. 
Op. at 9–10.   
 The Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.  
See Dec. Op. at 10–16.  The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial 
and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading 
detection.  Id. at 10–11.  And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor 
regarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same.  As the Court 
emphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the 
information presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2020 and the information 
presented to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about candor.  See Dec. Op. 
at 16.  There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of 
conditions of release.  Id.  While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in 
the opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not 
overcome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.   
As a result, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter 
the Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors.  While the fourth factor continues to 
favor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion

Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page7 of 12

 
 
 
8 
that the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight.  Thus, the Court again concludes that there 
are no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.  
B. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
The thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new 
proposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight.  The Defendant first 
offers to renounce her French and British citizenship.  Def. Mot. at 2.  And she also proposes to 
have most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a 
retired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority 
over the account.  Id.  Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed 
in December.  See Dec. Op. at 16–17; see also Def. Mot. at 2.  The new bail package does not 
disturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of showing that these 
conditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set 
of conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance. 
The Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom 
citizenship.  She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of 
bail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while 
not immediate, may be expedited.”  Def. Mot. at 4.  As the Government notes, the offer is of 
unclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.  
See Gov’t Opp’n at 5.  With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is 
again confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law.  The 
Government relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of 
the French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French 
national constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 8 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page8 of 12

 
 
 
9 
nationality is assessed at the time the offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent 
to said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said 
assessment of nationality.”1  Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.  The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the 
opinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the 
extradition request.  See Reply, Ex. A ¶ 11.  The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no 
case law addressing this precise issue.  Id. ¶ 21.   
Exacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend 
themselves to multiple interpretations.  For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between 
the United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the 
Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but 
the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the 
United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so.  The nationality of the person 
sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed.”  See Reply, 
Ex. A ¶ 9 (emphasis added)).  Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly 
provides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French 
nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is 
requested.”2  Id. ¶ 10; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.  Thus, there is considerable uncertainty 
as to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her 
ability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition.  The Court’s assessment of the risks largely 
 
1 The Court cites the translated version of the letter, though the original letter is in French.   
2 Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations.  The 
translated letter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual 
claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the 
offense on the basis of which removal is being requested.”  Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 9 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page9 of 12

 
 
 
10 
parallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition 
waiver.  See Dec. Op. at 12–13.   
Similar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship.  The 
Court is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce 
her UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK.  See 
Gov’t Opp’n at 6–7.  And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the 
proposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the 
Defendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition attempts.  The 
possibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the 
Defendant’s incentive to flee. 
To summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship 
does not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant 
poses.  Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the 
renunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of 
whether the Defendant poses a risk of flight.  See United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547 (SI), 
2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010).  And that same uncertainty—and the 
possibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes 
flight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.  
Nor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no 
condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.  The 
Defendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial 
affairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve 
disbursement of assets requiring his signature.  See Reply at 5.  The Court continues to have 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 10 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 2, 03/24/2021, 3065971, Page10 of 12

 
 
 
11 
concerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of 
the lack of transparency when she was first arrested.  But the Court assumes, for purposes of 
resolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it 
accounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets.  See Dec. Op. at 16–17.   
The monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, 
even when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package.  The Defendant 
would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to 
evade prosecution.  These include the $450,000 that the Defendant would retain for living 
expenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry 
and other chattels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  See Def. Mot. at 
5–6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9.  While those amounts may be a small percentage of the 
Defendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate 
flight.  When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3142(g) factors and the presumption 
of detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its 
conclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.  
If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the 
Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.  Yet while her proposed bail package 
is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances.  As a result, the Court again 
determines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis.  18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(1).

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-770, Document 3-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page6 of 25

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

27 LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Jeffrey S. Pagliuca

Maxwell. (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)
07/23/2020
28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-770, Document 3-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page10 of 25

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
81 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

92 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

95 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in
question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency'
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'
thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-770, Document 3-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page18 of 25

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to

transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423

lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

24, 2021. If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed

THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Motion for Pretrial Release 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell has a Constitutional right to be able to prepare 
effectively for trial.  The conditions of her pretrial detention deprive her 
of that right.  For over 280 days, she has been held in the equivalent of 
solitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental condition from 
lack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every 15 minutes by 
lights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate food, the constant 
glare of neon light, and intrusive searches, including having hands 
forced into her mouth in a squalid facility where COVID has run 
rampant. The medical literature is unanimous that such conditions 
produce mental deterioration, which prevents her from effective 
participation in trial preparation.   
Worse, even if Ms. Maxwell were able to be fully alert and 
mentally acute, she must review over 2,500,000 prosecution pages on a 
gutted computer, which does not have the ability to search, edit, or 
print.  Because of the pandemic, in-person lawyer visits are risky, so 
Ms. Maxwell sees her trial lawyers over a video screen, where she can 
review one page of the discovery at a time that is projected on a wall 
three feet away. 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page3 of 31

 
2 
 
These conditions would support a complaint for cruel and unusual 
punishment for a convicted felon.  Ms. Maxwell is not one.  She is 
innocent unless and until she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable 
doubt – an event which is highly unlikely given the lack of evidence 
against her.   
Despite the district court’s exhortations regarding the strength of 
the evidence against Ms. Maxwell, the truth is that the government’s 
so-called “evidence,” though voluminous, is palpably weak.  It consists 
of anonymous, untested hearsay accusations about events that are 
alleged to have occurred decades ago, accusations which only surfaced 
when the government faced public outrage over the inexplicable death 
of Jeffrey Epstein, while in their custody.  
The “Epstein Effect” clouded the judgment of the prosecutors into 
charging Ms. Maxwell because it needed a scapegoat, the Bureau of 
Prisons into putting Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch because Epstein died 
on their watch, the media into an absolute frenzy, and many other fair-
minded people into viewing Ms. Maxwell as guilty even though no 
evidence has been presented against her.

Notwithstanding the cries of the mob, Ms. Maxwell is presumed 
innocent and is entitled to defend herself. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell 
moves this Court for her immediate release. Fed. R. App. P. 9; 18 U.S.C. 
§§3142 and 3145.

ISSUES PRESENTED 
1. Whether Ms. Maxwell can effectively prepare her defense where she 
is being subjected to horrific conditions of detention during a global 
pandemic, including:  
 
• not being able to regularly see her lawyers in person to prepare 
for trial; 
 
• being kept awake all night to make sure she does not commit 
suicide even though nothing suggests she is a suicide risk; 
 
• having her every movement videotaped on multiple cameras 
focused on her every move;  
 
• being stuck in de facto solitary confinement without safe, in 
person visitation;  
 
• being forced to review millions of pages of documents on a 
stripped down computer without adequate hardware or 
software such that Ms. Maxwell cannot open tens of thousands 
of pages of discovery and for those she can open, only has the 
ability to review them one page at a time and cannot search, 
edit, copy, or print; 
 
• having no writing surface in her solitary cell; and  
 
• not consistently provided edible food or drinkable water. 
 
2. Whether the trial court erred by relying on the government’s proffer 
— which was comprised of nothing but extremely old, anonymous, 
unconfronted, hearsay accusations — to refuse to set reasonable bail.

FACTS 
   
Ghislaine Maxwell is a 59-year-old, law-abiding United States 
citizen with no criminal history.  In July 2020, she was living peacefully 
in her New Hampshire home and was in contact, through her attorneys, 
with the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District New York, 
which had opened an investigation into her only after the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead of asking her to surrender, that office had her 
arrested by a SWAT team and other unnecessary but intentionally 
showy tactics. That same day, the acting U.S. Attorney held a press 
conference with large charts, pausing for pictures for the media,1 before 
Ms. Maxwell had even appeared in the Southern District of New York. 
Since her arrest, Ms. Maxwell has faced nightmarish conditions. 
See, e.g., Ex.M. Though she is a model prisoner who poses no danger to 
society and has done literally nothing to prompt “special” treatment, 
she is kept in isolation – conditions fitting for Hannibal Lecter but not a 
59-year old woman who poses no threat to anyone. She is subjected to 
multiple invasive searches every day. Her every movement is captured 
on multiple video cameras. She is deprived of any real sleep by having a 
                                                          
1 The press conference is available online at https://tinyurl.com/bku2av7t

flashlight pointed into her cell every 15 minutes. For months, her food 
was microwaved with a plastic covering, which rendered it inedible 
after the plastic melted into the food.2 The water is often cloudy and is 
not drinkable.  Because of the pandemic, it is not safe to meet with her 
lawyers in person, so she cannot adequately prepare for trial. She is on 
suicide watch for no reason. She continues to lose weight, her hair, and 
her ability to concentrate. 
It is obvious that the BOP is subjecting Ms. Maxwell to this 
behavior because of the death of Epstein (and subsequent fallout).  But 
how is this permissible?  Since when are the conditions for one inmate 
dictated by the fate of another?  Perhaps never in the history of the U.S. 
Justice System has the public relations imperatives of the government 
permitted such wildly inappropriate and unconstitutional treatment of 
an innocent human being. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to 
participate effectively in the preparation of her defense under these 
conditions. 
The charges related to three of the anonymous accusers in the 
operative indictment are 25 years old, alleging actions from 1994-1997, 
                                                          
2 The prison has now promised to heat the food properly. 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page8 of 31

 
7 
 
while the just added accuser involves allegations from 2001-04.3 That 
the indictment exists at all is a function – solely – of the untimely death 
of Jeffrey Epstein and the media frenzy that followed. The indictment 
against Ms. Maxwell was brought only in the search for a scapegoat 
after the same U.S. Attorney’s Office had to dismiss its case against 
Epstein because of his death at MCC.  If there truly was any case 
against Ms. Maxwell, she would have been charged with Epstein in the 
SDNY in 2019.  But she was not. She also was not charged – or even 
named – in the 2008 Epstein case in Florida.  She would never be facing 
charges now if Epstein were alive. 
 
Although there have been a number of orders related to bond in 
this case, the district court held only one detention hearing.  At that 
hearing the government stated that Ms. Maxwell was a flight risk and 
that its case was strong.  But it did not proffer any actual evidence in 
support of its contention, or the district court’s conclusion, that the 
weight of the evidence against Maxwell was strong. Ex.A. Instead, it 
pointed again and again only to the fact that the grand jury returned an 
                                                          
3 The government superceded the indictment on March 29, just months 
before the July trial, adding two counts involving a fourth anonymous 
accuser. 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page9 of 31

indictment (which is, of course, true in every criminal case) and to the 
nature of the charges in the abstract. The district court bought into the 
government’s conclusory allegations, stating without support that: 
“[M]indful of the presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the 
view that in light of the proffered strength and nature of the 
Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.” 
(emphasis added).   
The court fundamentally erred in relying on the government’s 
empty assertions that its case is strong.  There was no principled way 
for the court to reach such a conclusion without hearing any evidence 
and without knowing anything at all about the allegations, especially 
here where the case is so old and based on anonymous hearsay which 
the defense has never been able to confront.  The government did not 
even proffer that these anonymous accusers even made their claims 
under oath. Prosecutors refuse to disclose their names, their 
statements, the specifics of their allegations, or anything about them.   
This case is anything but strong.  Ms. Maxwell should be granted 
bail or, at the very least, the case should be remanded for an 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page10 of 31

 
9 
 
evidentiary hearing to test whether the government’s case even 
marginally supports detention. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
A. The arrest and bail applications 
 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2020 and since that 
date has been detained in jaw-droppingly appalling conditions. The 
government claims that Ms. Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s “associate” 
and helped him “groom” minors for sex back in the 1990s and early 
2000s. Doc. 187. The indictment does not name these accusers and the 
government has refused to disclose their names or the specific dates 
that Ms. Maxwell supposedly did anything criminal.  
 
After her arrest, the government moved for detention.  Ex.A.  The 
defense responded.  Ex.B.  And the government replied.  Ex.C.  The trial 
judge held the arraignment and bond hearing over Zoom. Ex.D.  The 
government did not call any of the accusers in the indictment or present 
any witnesses related to flight, danger, or the strength of its case.  The 
government conceded that it was not asking for detention based on 
danger to the community.  The court ordered Ms. Maxwell detained at 
the conclusion of the hearing.  Ex.D.  
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 31

 
10 
 
 
The court said it was detaining Ms. Maxwell, in part, because the 
government proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated 
by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” Ex.D at 82.  
The court also pointed to Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” 
in the United States, her unclear financial picture, the “circumstances 
of her arrest,” and that although she is a U.S. citizen, she is also a 
citizen of France and Britain.  Id. at 82-87. 
 
Ms. Maxwell filed a second motion for bail and addressed each of 
these concerns. Ex.E. For starters, the defense explained that none of 
anonymous accusers’ testimony of abuse was corroborated and that it 
all related to Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell. In addition, Ms. Maxwell does 
have significant ties to the United States, her assets were thoroughly 
disclosed and vetted, and she is willing to waive extradition. The 
government responded. Ex.F. The defense replied.  Ex.G.  The judge 
again denied bail, relying, for the second time, on the “strong” evidence, 
even though no evidence was presented to the court to rely on.4 
 
Ms. Maxwell filed a third motion for bail.  Ex.I. In this application, 
she offered to renounce her foreign citizenship and also to have her 
                                                          
4 Ms. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from this Order, which is 
docketed in Case No. 21-58.   
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page12 of 31

 
11 
 
assets controlled and monitored by a former federal judge and former 
U.S. Attorney.  She also cited the 12 pretrial motions she filed.  
“Without prejudicing the merits of any of those pending motions,” the 
judge again denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion for bail, relying in part on the 
“proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,” even though, 
again, no evidence was actually submitted to or reviewed by the trial 
court. This appeal follows. 
In each of her bail requests and in separate pleadings, Ms. 
Maxwell has documented the Kafkaesque conditions that she is forced 
to endure.  See, e.g., Ex.M.   
B. The pretrial motions 
 
Ms. Maxwell filed 12 substantial pretrial motions. Docs. 119-26; 
133-48.   These include motions to dismiss for violation of the statute of 
limitations (Docs. 143-44) and for pre-indictment delay (Docs. 137-38) 
because the conduct is so old. And to dismiss because the government 
violated the non-prosecution agreement it reached with Epstein that 
protected any alleged co-conspirator from prosecution. Docs 141-42. The 
government needed 212 pages to respond to these motions.  These 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page13 of 31

 
12 
 
motions are pending and raise significant legal bars to the prosecution 
of this matter. 
C. The proposed bail package 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell has proposed a significant, compelling, and 
unprecedented bail package, which gives up or puts at risk everything 
that she has – her British and French citizenship, all of her and her 
spouse’s assets ($22.5 million),5 her family’s livelihood, and the 
financial security of her closest friends and family (totaling $5 million). 
A security company, which will monitor and secure Ms. Maxwell at her 
home, will also post an unprecedented $1 million bond.  Ex.E, I.  
Ms. Maxwell looks forward to confronting the accusers and 
clearing her name. She has no intention of fleeing and will be unable to 
do so if released on bond.  This bail package demonstrates these facts in 
a real way, unlike the government’s claims that the evidence against 
her is strong.  Even though a guarantee of appearance is not necessary, 
the bail package in this case is as close to a guarantee as one can get.  
There is no legally permissible basis to deny bail. 
 
                                                          
5 Her spouse would retain $400,000 for living and other expenses.

STANDARD OF REVIEW 
The question of whether a bail package will reasonably assure the 
defendant’s presence is a mixed question of law and fact. United States 
v. Horton, 653 F. App’x 46, 47 (2d Cir. 2016). This Court reviews the 
district court’s purely factual findings for clear error. Id. However, the 
district court’s ultimate finding “may be subject to plenary review if it 
rests on a predicate finding which reflects a misperception of a legal 
rule applicable to the particular factor involved.” Id. at 319–20 (quoting 
United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 1987)). That is, 
“even if the court’s finding of a historical fact relevant to that factor is 
not clearly erroneous, [the appellate court] may reverse if the court 
evinces a misunderstanding of the legal significance of that historical 
fact and if that misunderstanding infects the court's ultimate finding.” 
Shakur, 817 F.2d at 197. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
 
I. 
Ghislaine Maxwell should be released under §3142(i) 
because she cannot effectively prepare her defense 
under the horrific conditions she is facing. 
 
 
Trying to defend against exceedingly old, anonymous allegations 
is hard enough.  Doing so while in de facto solitary confinement without 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page15 of 31

 
14 
 
the real ability to meet with your lawyers face-to-face while being kept 
up all night and being given inedible food makes it virtually impossible, 
and violates Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights.  
 
Section 3142(i) makes clear that defendants must have the ability 
to consult with counsel and effectively prepare for their defense.  If this 
is not possible in custody, release is required.  United States v. 
Chandler, 1:19-CR-867 (PAC), 2020 WL 1528120, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
31, 2020) (extraordinary burdens imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, 
in conjunction with detainee’s right to prepare for his defense, 
constituted compelling reason to order temporary release from 
Metropolitan Correction Center). The COVID epidemic is still raging 
and conditions at MDC are unsafe.6  
Ms. Maxwell’s continued detention would be wrong at any point in 
this nation’s history, even when stealing a loaf of bread was a felony.  It 
is especially unwarranted now. “The hazards of a pandemic are 
immediate and dire, and still the rights of criminal defendants who are 
                                                          
6 Just for example, the air is not properly filtered in the small, enclosed 
attorney visit rooms at MDC and has been described as “a death trap” 
for lawyers and inmates. Ex.K, n.8.  Even though the prison is 
technically open for legal visits, lawyers are understandably not willing 
to walk into a viral petri dish.

subject to the weight of federal power are always a special concern of 
the judiciary.” Chandler, 2020 WL 1528120, at *2; United States v. 
Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 65-67 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding that “the 
obstacles the current public health crisis poses to the preparation of the 
Defendant’s defense constitute a compelling reason under 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(i)”); United States v. Weigand, 20-CR-188-1 (JSR), 2020 WL 
5887602, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2020) (holding that a wealthy 
defendant, who the government claimed was a flight risk, would be 
allowed to obtain his release pending trial during the coronavirus 
pandemic). 
“The right to consult with legal counsel about being released on 
bond, entering a plea, negotiating and accepting a plea agreement, 
going to trial, testifying at trial, locating trial witnesses, and other 
decisions confronting the detained suspect, whose innocence is 
presumed, is a right inextricably linked to the legitimacy of our criminal 
justice system.” Fed. Defs. of N.Y. v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 954 F.3d 
118, 134 (2d Cir. 2020); see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 
755 (1987) (“In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to 
trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.”). 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page17 of 31

 
16 
 
 
In United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1155 (D. Kan. 
2020), the court emphasized that “[m]ost courts addressing a motion for 
temporary release under §3142(i) have done so in the context of 
evaluating the necessity of the defendant assisting with preparing his 
or her defense ... This extends to the current COVID-19 pandemic 
[because 
of] 
the 
pandemic’s 
impact 
on 
counsel's 
difficulties 
communicating with the defendant.” See, e.g., Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 
at 65-67 (finding “the obstacles the current public health crisis poses to 
the preparation of the Defendant's defense constitute a compelling 
reason under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i)”); United States v. Robertson, 17-Cr-
2949, Doc. 306 (D.N.M. February 6, 2021).7 
 
The defendant in Robertson was charged with “frightening 
allegations” involving a shooting. He had previously violated bond. And 
he had a criminal record involving guns and drugs.  But the court 
ordered him released because of his inability to prepare for trial while 
in custody during the pandemic: 
Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his trial 
defense under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). That section allows a judicial 
                                                          
7 The 10th Circuit has stayed the Robertson order while it considers the 
government’s appeal. 
 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page18 of 31

officer who issued an order of detention to, by subsequent order, 
“permit the temporary release of the person … to the extent that 
the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for 
preparation of the person’s defense or for another compelling 
reason.” § 3142(i). 
 
The presumption of innocence should not be paid mere lip service, the 
court held, and being held without the ability to see counsel face-to-face 
was “no way to prepare for trial.”  
 
Ms. Maxwell presents a more compelling case than Robertson for 
temporary release under § 3142(i). Courts considering whether pretrial 
release is necessary have considered: “(1) [the] time and opportunity the 
defendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; 
(2) the complexity of the case and volume of information; and (3) 
expense 
and 
inconvenience 
associated 
with 
preparing 
while 
incarcerated.” Robertson, (citing United States v. Boatwright, 2020 WL 
1639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2020) (unreported) (citations omitted). 
Trial is set for July.  There is precious little time left to prepare 
and participate in that preparation.  The discovery involves millions of 
pages of documents. Ms. Maxwell cannot conduct searches of these 
documents; she cannot print them and spread them out on a desk for 
review; she cannot make notes on the documents; and she cannot move

the files around into a different order.  She is stuck looking at one page 
at a time over a screen three feet away without a lawyer in the same 
room. These are textbook untenable conditions. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 
3d at 67 (explaining the importance of legal visits and ordering bail 
during pandemic); Weigand, 2020 WL 5887602, at *2 (ordering bail 
during pandemic because defendant needed ability to review the 
discovery in complex, document-heavy case). This is no way to prepare 
for a trial where the government will be asking for a sentence that will 
imprison her for the rest of her life.  Ex.A 
This Court has recognized that, after a relatively short time, 
pretrial detention turns into prohibited, unconstitutional punishment. 
United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987) (“grave due 
process concerns” are implicated by a seven-month period of pretrial 
detention); United States v. Melendez-Carrions, 790 F.2d 984, 1008 (2d 
Cir. 1986) (Feinberg, J. concurring) (“[G]eneral requirements of due 
process compel us to draw the line [of permissible pretrial detention] 
well short of [] eight months.”). Under the current conditions, it can 
hardly be disputed that Ms. Maxwell is being punished, which in itself 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page20 of 31

 
19 
 
requires relief.  Add to that the barriers she is facing to preparing her 
defense and this Court should order her release under 3142(i). 
II. 
The trial court erred in relying on the government’s 
proffer—which comprised nothing but old, anonymous, 
unconfronted, hearsay accusations—to refuse to set 
reasonable bail for Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 
 
The government stressed the strength of its case in seeking 
detention, highlighting the “strength of the Government’s evidence” on 
page 1 of its application for detention. Ex.A. For support, the 
government made the circular argument that the evidence is strong 
because of “the facts set forth in the Indictment.”  Id. at 5. It made the 
same argument in the reply. Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong 
because “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations 
against Ms. Maxwell).  
 
Of course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v. 
Giampino, 680 F.2d 898, 901 n. 3 (2d. Cir. 1982). Every circuit with 
published pattern instructions inform juries that they are not to 
consider the indictment as evidence. See, e.g., Third Circuit (“An 
indictment is simply a description of the charge(s) against a defendant. 
It is an accusation only. An indictment is not evidence of anything, and 
you should not give any weight to the fact that (name) has been indicted 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page21 of 31

 
20 
 
in making your decision in this case.”); Fifth Circuit: (“The indictment 
… is only an accusation, nothing more. It is not proof of guilt or 
anything else. The defendant therefore starts out with a clean slate.”); 
Sixth Circuit: (“The indictment … does not even raise any suspicion of 
guilt.”).  
 
The government did not provide one single document to the court 
to back up its claims that the accusers’ allegations about events from 
1994-97 were truthful.  The government has refused to disclose even the 
names of these accusers.  Contrary to its assertions to the lower court, 
its allegations are not corroborated.  Ex.E at 30-33 (“[T]he discovery 
contains not a single contemporaneous email, text message, phone 
record, diary entry, police report, or recording that implicates Ms. 
Maxwell in the 1994-1997 conduct underlying the conspiracy charged in 
the indictment.”). 
 
The government only made these allegations after Epstein’s 
inexplicable death at MCC.  Ms. Maxwell was not named in Epstein’s 
indictment as a defendant or a co-conspirator.  She was charged as a 
substitute for Epstein.  Reverse engineering a charge many years later 
because of the main target’s death is not the makings of a strong case.   
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page22 of 31

 
21 
 
 
Recognizing this weakness, the Government relies on the 
statutory maximum penalty to argue that the case is serious and that 
Ms. Maxwell poses a risk of flight.  But the statutory maximum is 
hardly relevant to determine risk of flight.  In the vast majority of 
federal cases, the statutory maximum penalties are sky-high and are 
not reflective of the real potential penalties.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1658(b) 
(statutory maximum of life imprisonment for turning off a light in a 
lighthouse to expose a ship to danger). 
 
Even if there were evidence to back up the four anonymous 
accusers, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of the 
commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potential long sentence 
to support a finding of risk of flight.” United States v. Friedman, 837 
F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d. Cir. 1988) (district court’s finding that defendant 
posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long 
sentence of incarceration”); Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing 
detention order where defendants agreed to significant physical and 
financial restrictions, despite the fact that they faced a “lengthy term of 
incarceration”).   
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 31

 
22 
 
 
This is why defendants charged under the same statute in the 
Southern District of New York are regularly granted bond. United 
States v. Hussain, 18-mj-08262-UA (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2018) (defendant 
charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 violations granted $100,000 personal 
recognizance bond with home detention, electronic monitoring, and 
other conditions); United States v. Buser, 17-mj-07599-UA (S.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 19, 2017) (defendant charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 and 2423 
violations granted $100,000 personal recognizance bond, secured by 
$10,000 cash, with electronic monitoring and other conditions); United 
States v. Acosta, 16-mj-08569-UA (S.D.N.Y Mar. 29, 2016) (denying the 
Government’s detention application after argument and granting 
defendant charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 violations $100,000 personal 
recognizance bond with home detention, electronic monitoring, and 
other conditions); United States v. McFadden, 17-mj-04708-UA 
(S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2017) (defendant charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 and 
2423 violations granted $250,000 personal recognizance bond, secured 
by property, with home detention, electronic monitoring and other 
conditions). 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page24 of 31

 
23 
 
 
The government shotguns manufactured assertions in support of 
the supposed flight risk. First, the ridiculous contention that she was 
hiding before her arrest.   In fact, she was living in, and arrested in, her 
own home in New Hampshire.  She was in touch with her lawyers and 
as the government has to concede, her lawyers were communicating 
with the government.  Ex.D at 27. Despite plenty of opportunities, she 
had not left the United States since Epstein’s arrest, and had been 
living in the United States for 30 years. She became a U.S. citizen.  She 
lived and worked here for 30 years. The government knew exactly 
where she was.  (FBI New York Assistant Director William Sweeney 
Jr.: “We’d been discretely keeping tabs on Maxwell’s whereabouts as we 
worked this investigation.”)   
The fact that she was holed up in her home because she was being 
relentlessly harassed by the media is not evidence of hiding from the 
government.  In fact, one sensational tabloid put a £10,000 bounty on 
her. “Wanted: The Sun is offering a £10,000 reward for information on 
… Ghislaine Maxwell,” The Sun, November 20, 2019, available at: 
https://tinyurl.com/3vewtnx3. Anyone facing these unprecedented safety 
concerns from the media mob would try to keep a low profile. But a low 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page25 of 31

 
24 
 
profile is not flight.  Ms. Maxwell could have left the United States had 
she wanted to flee.  She did not want to do that and she did not do that.  
Instead, she chose to stay here and fight the bogus charges against her.  
This factor weighs heavily in favor of bond. 
 
The government’s next argument is that she has foreign ties and 
significant assets. But Ms. Maxwell addressed those concerns by 
renouncing her British and French citizenship and by agreeing to have 
her and her spouse’s assets (other than basic living expenses and legal 
fees) placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal 
district judge and former U.S. Attorney who will have authority over 
them. Ex.I.  
 
Even someone with the government’s imagination can’t conjure up 
anything else Ms. Maxwell could do to show that she is serious about 
staying here to fight the allegations against her.  She will agree to 
whatever condition the court orders and she will take the extraordinary 
step of renouncing her foreign citizenship. The government cannot 
explain how Ms. Maxwell could flee.  She will have no assets (other 
than living expenses).  She will have no country that will protect her. 
Her family and friends will be at risk. She will be heavily and 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page26 of 31

 
25 
 
constantly monitored.  And of course, she is recognizable around the 
globe. 
 
The truth is that wealthy men charged with similar or more 
serious offenses, many of whom have foreign ties, are routinely granted 
bail so that they can effectively prepare for trial. Bernie Madoff. Harvey 
Weinstein. Bill Cosby. John Gotti. Marc Dreier. Dominique Strauss-
Kahn. Ali Sadr. Adnan Khashoggi. Mahender Sabhnani. The list goes 
on and on.  In each case, the court set reasonable conditions of bond and 
the defendants appeared, despite similar arguments by the government 
that the defendant faced serious charges or that the evidence was 
strong or that he had foreign ties or that he had great wealth.   Ms. 
Maxwell is entitled to the same opportunity as male defendants to 
prepare her defense. 
Even putting aside the pandemic and the current conditions of 
Ms. Maxwell’s confinement, pretrial detention “is an extraordinary 
remedy” that should be reserved for only a very “limited group of 
offenders.” United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 8 (2d Cir. 1987). For 
this reason, a judge may deny a defendant bail “only for the strongest of 
reasons.” Hung v. United States, 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (Brennan, 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page27 of 31

 
26 
 
J.). The Constitution’s “prohibitions on the deprivation of liberty 
without due process and of excessive bail require careful review of 
pretrial detention orders to ensure that the statutory mandate [of the 
Bail Reform Act] has been respected.” United States v. Motamedi, 767 
F.2d 1403, 1405 (9th Cir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.). Because the consequence 
of error – the unjust deprivation of liberty from an individual who is 
presumed innocent – is contrary to our Constitution, “doubts regarding 
the propriety of release should be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Id. 
 
Even where the government is able to prove that an accused is an 
actual flight risk, pretrial detention generally remains inappropriate. 
United States v. Berrios-Berrios, 791 F.2d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 1986) (“the 
presumption in favor of bail still applies where the defendant is found to 
be a risk of flight”) (emphasis added). Where the only question is 
whether the defendant is a risk of flight, “the law still favors pre-trial 
release subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination 
of conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the person as required.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75. 
Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page28 of 31

 
27 
 
  
The Supreme Court has explained that when “the Government 
has admitted that its only interest is in preventing flight, bail must be 
set by a court at a sum designed to ensure that goal, and no more.”  
 
The government simply has not come close to satisfying its heavy 
burden of proving that “no conditions” exist that will reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell’s presence. It has not articulated with any evidence, let 
alone specific and credible evidence, how Ms. Maxwell could manage to 
flee under the proposed bail conditions. Speculation is not permitted. 
United States v. Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2004) (where government’s argument that no 
conditions could assure defendant’s future presence was based, “in large 
part, on speculation,” defendant was released to home confinement with 
GPS monitoring). We challenge the government to point to a high 
profile defendant who in the recent past has 1) fled and 2) gotten away 
with it. 
  
The reality is that defendants with far greater likelihood of 
conviction than Ms. Maxwell are granted bond and appear in court.  Ms. 
Maxwell should not be treated differently.

28 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Ms. Maxwell faces old, anonymous accusations that have never 
been tested.  In any other case, she would have been released long ago.  
But because of the “Epstein effect,” she is being detained and in truly 
unacceptable conditions.  All we are asking for is a chance to defend the 
case. We respectfully request that Ms. Maxwell be released on 
reasonable conditions of bail or that the case be remanded for an 
evidentiary hearing.

20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
THE GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDUM 
IN SUPPORT OF DETENTION 
For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine 
Max well, the defendant, poses an extreme 1isk of flight; that she will not be able to rebut the 
statuto1y presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E); and that the CoUlt should 
therefore order her detained. 
TI1e charges in this case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine 
Maxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial sexual predator, exploited and abused young 
girls for years. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell now faces the very real 
prospect of serving many years in prison. TI1e strength of the Govenunent's evidence and the 
substantial prison te1m the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for 
the defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant's extensive international ties, 
her citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United 
States. In sho1t, Maxwell has tlu·ee passports, large sums of money, extensive international 
connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in tl1e United States and face the possibility of a 
lengtl1y p1ison sentence.

BACKGROUND 
On June 29, 2020, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a 
sealed indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of conspiracy to entice 
minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U. S.C. § 3 71 ; one count of enticing 
a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S. C. § 2422 and 2; one count of 
conspiracy to transport minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; 
one count of transporting minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 
a11d 2; a11d two counts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
TI1e chai·ges ai·ise from a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls at Epstein's prope1ties 
in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, between approximately 1994 and 1997. During that time, 
Maxwell had a personal a11d professional relationship with Epstein a11d was one of his closest 
associates. 
Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Epstein, through a vaiiety of means and methods. In particulai·, she played 
a key role in Epstein's abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse 
underage girls. As a pa1t of their scheme, the defenda11t a11d Epstein enticed a11d caused minor 
victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended 
would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in 
multiple ways. For example, she attempted to befriend ce1tain victims by asking them about their 
lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with 
Epstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who 
seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, 
2 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page8 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 4 of 10 
the defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein's offers of financial assistance, including 
offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as 14 years old when 
they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims 
were mmors. 
l11e Indictment fruther alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In 
2016, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern 
District of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in 
facilitating the abuse of minors. l11e defendant repeatedly lied ru1der oath when questioned about 
her conduct with minor girls. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Refo1m Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal coruts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the c01mnunity or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). A finding of 1isk of flight must 
be suppo1ted by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarco, 948 F.2d 
789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. 
Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400,405 (2d Cir. 1985). A fmding of dangerousness must be supported by 
clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir. 
1995); Patriarco, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. 
l11e Bail Refmm Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circrunstances of the c1imes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character ... landJ 
fmancial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See

18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (Government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be 
presumed, subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure 
the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the c01mnmlity. 
18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
II. 
Discussion 
For the reasons set fo1th below, the defendant presents an extreme 1isk of flight, and 
therefore she cannot overcome the statuto1y presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every 
one of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight 1isk - the nature and circumstances of the 
offense, the strength of the evidence, and the hist01y and characte1istics of the defendant - counsel 
strongly in favor of detention. 
A 
The 
ature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
TI1e "nature and circumstances" of this om~nse favor detention. As the Indictment alleges, 
the defendant committed se1ious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(g)(l) (specifically enumerating ' whether the offense ... involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transpo1ting minors for illegal sex 
4 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page10 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 6 of 10 
acts are so serious that both crimes cany a statuto1y presumption that no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 
(e)(3)(E). l11e defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as 14 years 
old, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors. 
l11ese offenses cany significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years' 
imprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in 
assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, 
at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) (' lTJhe steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight 
risk is, especially considering the strong case of the government .... ") ( quoting United States v. 
AlindaterPere::., 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory 
maximum of decades in prison. l11is fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone 
to flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at 
age 58, faces the ve1y real prospect of spending a substantial p01tion of the rest of her life in prison. 
l11e strength of the evidence in this case underscores the 1isk that the defendant will become 
a fugitive. As the facts set fmth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong. 
Multiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and c01rnborated information against the 
defendant. l11e victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony, 
and other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entlies, business records, and other evidence 
co1rnborate the victims' account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any tiial 
in this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
l11e passage of time between the defendant's conduct and these charges does not counsel 
otherwise. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations pe1iod for conduct that was timely as of the 
5 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 7 of 10 
date of the amendment, 1 to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor 
victim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because 
Congress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the 
previous statute was still running, the extension was pe1missible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at * 1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). Moreover, while 
the conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occUITed years ago, the risk of a significant term 
of incarceration - and thus the motive to flee - is of course only very recent. 
Each of these factors - the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration - creates an extraordinaiy incentive to flee. And as fu1ther 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
B. 
The Chai·acte1istics of the Defendai1t 
The history ai1d chai·acteristics of the defendai1t also strongly suppmt detention. As an 
initial matter, the defendant's extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her 
to flee ai1d live abroad. The defendai1t was born in Frai1ce ai1d raised in the United Kingdom, 
where she attended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 
2002, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom ai1d France. Travel records from 
United States Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") reflect that she has engaged in frequent 
international travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last tlu·ee years to locations 
including tl1e United Kingdom, Japai1, ai1d Qatai·. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent 
with her citizenship status, the defendai1t appears to possess passpmts from the United States, 
France, and tl1e United Kingdom. 
1 P1ior to the ainendment, tl1e statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until 
tl1e victim reached the age of 25, ai1d as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment 
remained timely as of the 2003 amendment desc1ibed above.

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 8 of 10 
In addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that 
would enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government's investigation to date, the 
Government has identified more than 15 different bank accounts held by or associated with the 
defendant from 2016 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those 
accounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than 
20 
million. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as 
recently as 2019. For example, the defendant t:ransfe1rnd 500,000 from one of her accounts to 
anotl1er in March 2019, and transfe1Ted more than 300,000 from one of her accounts to anotl1er 
in July 2019. She has also reported, including as recently as 2019, that she holds one or more 
foreign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars. 
The defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2016 property sale. 
In paiticular, in 2016, tl1e defendant appeai·s to have sold a New York City residence for 15 
million through a limited liability compai1y. On or about the date of the sale, ainounts totaling 
more than 14 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as 
the owner. Several days later, more than 14 million was transfo1Ted from that account into 
anotl1er account opened in the name of the defendant.2 In short, the defendant's financial resources 
appeai· to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her 
total fu1ai1cial picture opaque ai1d indetenninate, even upon a review of bailk records available to 
the Government. 
2 The Govermnent additionally notes that, somewhat fu1ther back in time, in transactions occuning 
between 2 007 ai1d 2011 , approximately more thai1 20 million was trai1sfe1Ted from accounts 
associated witl1 Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in 
the millions of dollars that were then subsequently trai1Sferred back to accounts associated with 
Epstein.

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 9 of 10 
The defendant's international co1mections and significant financial means would present a 
clear risk of flight under 1101mal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by 
the transient nature of defendant's current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively 
been in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July 
2019. Thereafter, the defendant -who had previously made many public appearances - stopped 
appearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears 
that she made intentional effo1ts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice, 
switching her primaiy phone number (which she registered under the name ' G Max") ai1d email 
address, and ordering packages for delive1y with a different person listed on the shipping label. 
Most recently, the defendant appeai·s to have been hiding on a 156-acre prope1ty acquired in an 
all-cash purchase in December 2019 (tlu·ough a cai·efully ai1011ymized LLC) in Bradford, New 
Hainpshire, an area to which she has no other known connections. 
TI1e defendant appeai·s to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United 
States. She has no children, does not reside with ai1y ilmnediate family members, ai1d does not 
appeai· to have ai1y employment that would require her to remail1 in the United States. 
or does 
she appear to have any pennanent ties to any paiticular location in the United States. As such, the 
Government respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of 
overcomil1g the presumption of detention, because there ai·e no bail conditions that could 
reasonably assure the defendai1t's contilmed appeai·a11ce il1 this case. 
In pai·ticulai·, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to 
mitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring 
device. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head stait 
should she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at * 1

(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because 
home detention with electronic monitoring ' at best ... limits a fleeing defendant's head stait"); 
United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) 
(same); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. 
Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same). 
CONCLUSION 
As set fo1th above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. TI1e Government respectfully 
submits that the defendai1t caimot meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption in 
favor of detention. There are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in 
cowt proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the 
government’s July 2, 2020 Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Gov. Mem.”). 
It is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public attention than the 
government’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2019, Epstein was indicted for 
offenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media attention focused on the 
nature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August 10, 2019, Epstein died in 
federal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute 
her for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had 
never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always 
denied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were 
threatening and harassing to our client and those close to her. 
But sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not 
Jeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2019, despite 
the fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current 
indictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years 
ago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the 
presumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since 1991, has 
litigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even 
once since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly 
publicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes 
before this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and 
other circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject 
to the strict conditions proposed below.

Background.  Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the 
United States since 1991. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United 
Kingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell 
graduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in 1991, and has lived in this 
country ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her 
six siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2019 
indictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her now. She is especially close to two of her 
sisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has 
numerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to 
many of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained committed to her because they 
do not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have known for 
decades. 
The Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in showing 
that detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
will secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government 
relies on the presumption of detention in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms. 
Maxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of 
the United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for 
each country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing 
recent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law 
enforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular 
contact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government 
argues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant

detention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government 
does not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section 
3142(g)(4). 
Ms. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms. 
 
Maxwell, on the strict conditions proposed below (or as modified by the Court), for two 
compelling reasons. 
First, the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As 
this Court has noted, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to 
incarcerated individuals, and COVID-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with 
pretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put, 
under these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious 
risk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9). 
Second, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under 
the Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government 
may be rebutted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S. 
citizen and has lived in this country for almost 30 years; she ran a non-profit company based in 
the United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it down to 
protect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with 
family members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct 
indicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil 
litigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from 
the time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the 
government. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable

purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention 
and its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities, 
and reputational damage simply for knowing her. The government’s remaining arguments— 
about Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they 
would require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail, 
which is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed below, the government’s position regarding 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged 
conduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail 
analysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 21). 
Proposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the following bail 
conditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous 
situations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible 
people, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United 
Kingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ii) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of 
New York; (iii) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict 
supervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of 
New York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate 
family, close friends and counsel; (vii) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s 
office, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (viii) such other 
terms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3142. 
The Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is 
entitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) 
(“Nothing in this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of 
Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 9 of 26

innocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell 
presents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3142. The strict bail 
conditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive” 
set of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the 
health and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be 
detained pending trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(1)(B). Under the controlling legal standards, 
Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail. 
ARGUMENT 
 
There are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release 
on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed: 
First, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-19 if she is detained, 
and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the 
restrictions that have been placed on attorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic. 
Second, the government has failed to carry its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142 that no 
combination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in 
court. 
I. 
The Conditions Created by the COVID-19 Pandemic Mandate the Release of 
Ms. Maxwell. 
 
Impact of COVID-19 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by 
the COVID-19 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions. 
Four months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, 15-CR-95 (AJN), 2020 WL 
1295155 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020), that COVID-19 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily 
dangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. Id. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no 
underlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s 
Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page24 of 200

prior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-19. At the time, COVID- 
19 had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no known outbreak in 
the prison population. Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of 
contracting COVID-19 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed 
circumstance, ordered the defendant released. Id. 
Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-19 risks to inmates have 
increased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-19 in correctional 
facilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates known to have COVID-19 has 
doubled to 68,000, and prison deaths tied to COVID-19 have increased by 73 percent.1 Indeed, 
as of July 2, 2020, nine of the ten largest known clusters of the coronavirus in the United States 
are in federal prisons and county jails.2 As this Court noted last month, “the ‘inability [of] 
individuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene 
products’ [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable.” United States 
v. Williams-Bethea, No. 18-CR-78 (AJN), 2020 WL 2848098, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 2, 2020) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The risks are further enhanced by the possibility 
of a second wave of coronavirus cases.3 
In particular, COVID-19 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan Detention Center 
(MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her 
there on July 6, 2020. According to the MDC’s statistics, as of April 3, 2020, two inmates and

five staff had tested positive; by June 30, 2020, those numbers had risen to 14 and 41, 
respectively.4 The increased spread among prisons means that the COVID-19 risks that were 
present in the Stephens case four months ago are far more serious for Ms. Maxwell now and 
mandate her release. 
Impact of COVID-19 on the Ability to Prepare the Defense. The Stephens opinion 
provides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell’s release: if she is 
detained, her ability to meet with her attorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly 
impaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 
In Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant’s release under 18 
 
U.S.C. § 3142(i), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such 
release is “necessary for preparation of the person’s defense.” Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at 
*3. The Court noted that the spread of COVID-19 had compelled the BOP to suspend all in- 
person visits, including legal visits, except as allowed on a case-by-case basis. Id. at *3. That 
suspension persists to this day.5 In a case such as this, which will require assessing evidence 
relating to events that occurred approximately twenty-five years ago, including documents and 
personal recollections, numerous in-person meetings between counsel and Ms. Maxwell will be 
critical to the preparation of the defense. The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into 
question whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial. As in

Stephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her attorneys while this policy is in effect 
constitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at *3.6 
Even speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID- 
19-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in 
which case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week, 
however, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required. 
At approximately 5:30 p.m. on July 6, 2020, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell 
about waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and 
ordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:00 p.m. that night with a proposed date 
and time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call, 
making specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until 
9:00 p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to 
reach our client in time if she is detained.7 In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has 
not been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials. 
The prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her 
review, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case 
compound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review 
 
6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants 
released on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to 
prepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 20-MJ-3073 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2020) (releasing 
undocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and 
risk of COVID-19); United States v. Hudson, 19-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (releasing defendant in 
drug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-19 bail applications were denied, 
because of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-19); United States v. Chandler, 19-CR-867 
(PAC), 2020 WL 1528120, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with 
prior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-19 restrictions). 
7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell 
each morning until the initial appearance to facilitate attorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate 
these efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shows no signs of abating. Nor would it be 
appropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our 
communications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.

documents and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist 
in the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons” 
justifying her release. See id.8 
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. 
 
The grave concerns raised by the current COVID-19 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell 
must be released because she has met her limited burden of production showing that she does not 
pose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition 
or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court. 
A. 
Applicable Law 
 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention 
prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 
U.S. 739, 755 (1987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v. 
Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)). The Bail Reform Act 
provides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3142(b)) 
(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the 
appearance” of the defendant in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). Where conditions are necessary, 
such release shall be “subject to the least restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court] 
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a 
limited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
 
8 See also Letter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2020), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v. 
Federal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. 19 Civ. 660 (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc. No. 78) (detailing absence of in-person 
visitation, highly limited VTC and telephone call capacity, and issues pertaining to legal mail and legal documents).

The government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government 
must show “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of 
flight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this 
burden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or 
combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his 
presence in court.” Id. 
In determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant, the court must consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the 
offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and 
characteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or 
the community that would be posed by the person’s release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). 
In this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms. 
 
Maxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply. 
 
The Bail Reform Act contains a rebuttable presumption, applicable based on certain of 
the crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of 
production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with 
evidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d 
311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted).  This rebuttable presumption can be readily 
satisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4–11–70756 MAG (DMR), 2011 WL 3421321, at *2 
(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a 
category listed in § 3142(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption. United States v. 
Dominguez, 783 F.2d 702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Mattis, No. 20-1713, 
Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page29 of 200

11 
 
 
2020 WL 3536277, at *4–5 (2d Cir. June 30, 2020). Although the presumption “remains a factor 
to be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[a]t all times . . . 
the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the 
evidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions. 
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States 
v. Deutsch, No. 18-CR-502 (FB), 2020 WL 3577398, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 1, 2020). And 
regardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, “[n]othing in 
this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.” 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(j); see also United States v. Crowell, No. 06-CR-291E(F), 2006 WL 3541736, 
at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2006) (those charged with crimes involving minors “continue to enjoy 
the presumption of innocence in setting conditions of release.”). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Rebutted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight 
Risk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No 
Combination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her 
Presence In Court 
 
The government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions 
will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth below, Ms. 
Maxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior 
to her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same 
reasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which 
are consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release, 
will not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms. 
Maxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.

1. 
Ms. Maxwell’s Personal History and Characteristics 
Demonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk 
 
a. 
Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has 
Significant Ties to the United States and the New York Region 
 
Ms. Maxwell’s history and characteristics do not “strongly support detention,” as the 
government contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in 
this country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail 
conditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty- 
five-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the 
present. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this 
country for almost 30 years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. Ms. Maxwell 
also has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign 
her bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-born 
citizens.  Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with 
them, as well as with her nieces and nephews.  Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close 
friends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has 
been Ms. Maxwell’s home for decades. 
b. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District 
and Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein’s 2019 Arrest 
 
Ms. Maxwell has never once attempted to “hide” from the government or her 
accusers, and has never shown any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms. 
Maxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct 
related to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully 
intends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example, 
since 2015, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil

13 
 
 
cases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in 
those cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case, 
which has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the 
United States. Indeed, on July 7, 2019, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached 
out to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and 
maintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest. 
The government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent 
international travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she 
has not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain 
in the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2019 is 
particularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been 
even more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press 
articles began turning the public’s attention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for 
Epstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s 
investigation.9 Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be 
victims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution. 
Despite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was 
redirected toward her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave 
the country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was 
arrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v. Friedman,

United States v. DiGiacomo, 746 F. Supp. 1176, 1179-80 (D. Mass. 1990) (concluding 
defendants did not present a flight risk because each of them “for three years knew there 
was substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not attempt to flee 
before indictment”). 837 F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d Cir. 1988) (overturning district court’s decision 
that defendant posed a flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took “no 
steps” to flee jurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home 
and arrest); United States v. DiGiacomo, 746 F. Supp. 1176, 1179-80 (D. Mass. 1990) 
(concluding defendants did not present a flight risk because each of them “for three years 
knew there was substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not attempt 
to flee before indictment”). 
ƒ 
Indeed, the absence of any allegation by the government that Ms. Maxwell was 
taking steps to leave the country at the time of her arrest is conspicuous. The government 
has offered no proof that she was making plans to leave the country. In fact, had the 
government alerted her counsel that she was about to be arrested, we would have arranged 
for Ms. Maxwell’s prompt, voluntary surrender. Instead, the government arrested Ms. 
Maxwell without warning on the day before the July 4th holiday, thus ensuring that she 
would be in federal custody on the one-year anniversary of Epstein’s arrest.

Ms. Maxwell’s Actions to Protect Herself From Intrusive Media 
Coverage and Death Threats Do Not Demonstrate an Intent to 
Flee 
 
Furthermore, the steps Ms. Maxwell took to leave the public eye after Epstein’s 
arrest are not indicative of a risk of flight. The government notes that Ms. Maxwell dropped

out of public view after Epstein’s arrest, which the government seeks to portray as “hiding” 
from the law. The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid 
detection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov. 
Mem. at 8). But Ms. Maxwell did not take these steps to hide from law enforcement or 
evade prosecution. Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to

take to protect herself, her family members, her friends and colleagues, and their children, 
from unrelenting and intrusive media coverage, threats, and irreparable reputational harm. 
Ever since Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell has been at the center of a crushing 
onslaught of press articles, television specials, and social media posts painting her in the 
most damning light possible and prejudging her guilt. The sheer volume of media reporting 
mentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in 
literally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media 
attention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In 
November 2019, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £10,000 bounty for information 
about Ms. Maxwell’s location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read: 
“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £10,000 reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal 
Ghislaine Maxwell.”10 And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media 
reports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid 
questioning by the FBI.11 She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in 
the bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest on July 2, 2020, her counsel has been flooded 
with hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public. 
The “open season” declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein’s death has come with an  
even darker cost – she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and 
has had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only 
intensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends. Some of Ms. 
Maxwell’s closest friends who had nothing whatsoever to do with Epstein have lost their jobs or

suffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms. 
Maxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do – she separated herself from 
everyone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and 
her friends out of harm’s way.12 
Lacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell 
presents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk 
argument is reduced to the following: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign 
citizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who now faces serious charges. 
But if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any 
meaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United 
States 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must show 
more than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of 
[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in 
this Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of 
flight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial 
foreign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v. 
Hansen, 108 F. App’x 331 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 
2009); United States v.  Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y.  
Jan. 28. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v. 
Kashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). 
 
Finally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would 
pose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to 
12 The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had 
direct communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever. One such person has 
even given numerous television interviews on news shows in the United Kingdom.

France and the United Kingdom.13 Notably, two weeks ago, this Court recognized in United 
States v. Abdellatif El Mokadem, No. 19-CR-646 (AJN), 2020 WL 3440515 (S.D.N.Y. June 
23, 2020) that “concerns regarding risk of flight are mitigated by the ongoing [COVID-19] 
pandemic, which has understandably curtailed travel across the country, and, indeed, around 
the world.” Id. at *1. In that case, despite finding detention to be warranted on two prior 
occasions, the Court concluded that the government could no longer establish flight risk and 
ordered the defendant released pending sentencing. Id. (“Taking account of the COVID-19 
pandemic, which had not yet reached this country when the Court last considered 
Defendant’s custody status, the balance now clearly and convincingly tips in Defendant’s 
favor ....... ”). Consideration of this factor weighs heavily in favor of release on the proposed 
bail conditions here. 
 
2. 
The Nature and Circumstances of the Charges and the 
Weight of the Evidence Militate in Favor of Bail 
 
The Defense Has Rebutted the Presumption Relating to Certain of the Charges. The 
government relies on the statutory presumption of detention applicable to offenses involving 
minor victims. (Gov. Mem. at 4-5.) But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the 
government does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that 
she suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 314-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Even according to the indictment, Ms. 
Maxwell’s alleged participation in offenses involving minors ended in 1997. Here, the only

England will leave mandatory 14-day quarantine restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States).

applicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebutted that 
presumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country 
after Epstein’s arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follow 
other courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebutted the 
presumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged 
offenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2020 WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres, 
No. 3:20-CR-18-J-32JBT, 2020 WL 1042051, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2020); Conway, 
2011 WL 3421321, at *4-5. 
 
The Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that 
detention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem. 
at 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential 
punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of 
the commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a 
finding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court’s finding that 
defendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence 
of incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order 
where defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact 
that they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a 
long sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.14 
 
 
14 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009), cited 
approvingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) for 
the proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering 
the strong case of the government . . . .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts 
from Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 20-year old conduct as here, but 
instead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61. The 
evidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and 
the defendant faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Id. at 61-64. These factors are not present in this case. 
Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page38 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 24 of 26 
19 
 
 
Moreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend 
“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure 
even if she were convicted on all counts is 10 years, assuming the Court were to follow the 
traditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a 10-year 
sentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further 
demonstrating that the government has not met its burden of showing Ms. Maxwell is an 
actual risk of flight. 
The Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the 
strength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal 
challenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s 
September 24, 2007 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which 
covers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ii) the conspiracy, enticement of minors, 
and transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (iii) 
the two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.15 In addition, as 
we understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on 
the testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago 
between 1994 and 1997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to 
decades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s 
case, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to 
Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.

3. 
The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than 
Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence 
 
For the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the 
circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk 
and prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government 
has not carried its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed 
bail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms. 
Maxwell’s presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(1)(B). 
The package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and 
friends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her 
despite the unrelenting media attacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered 
as a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an 
extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is 
also to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million. 
The package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering 
all passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern 
Districts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell, 
for personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release. 
Under the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial 
Services.16 
 
 
16 In United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2019), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under 
which a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed 
security guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant 
“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a 
condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Id. (emphasis in original). We submit 
that a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United 
States, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 26 of 26 
21 
 
 
Ms. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal 
circumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in 
connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them 
and their families from harm. 
The proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this 
Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v. 
Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family 
who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions), 
aff’d, 749 F. App’x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831, 832 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Marc Dreier, accused of “colossal criminality” and alleged to be a “high 
flight risk,” granted release subject to conditions); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 
240, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Bernie Madoff, charged with “largest Ponzi scheme ever” and 
alleged to be a “serious risk of flight,” granted release subject to conditions). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not have Ms. Maxwell’s means, would be released on bail conditions. Accordingly, if the Court deems it necessary, 
it may impose private security guards as a condition of release.

20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
THE GOVERNMENT'S REPLY MEMORANDUM 
IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF DETENTION 
l11e Government respectfully submits this reply memorandum in fruther suppmt of its 
motion for detention, dated July 2, 2020 (the "Detention Memorandum") (Dkt. 4), and in response 
to the defendant's memorandum in opposition (the "Opposition Memorandum") (Dkt. 18). 
l11e charges against Ghislaine Max well a1ise from her essential role in sexual exploitation 
that caused deep and lasting harm to vulnerable victims. At the heart of this case are brave women 
who are victims of se1ious c1imes that demand justice. l11e defendant's motion wholly fails to 
appreciate the diiving force behind this case: the defendant's victims were sexually abused as 
minors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell's actions, and they have caiTied the trauma from 
these events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial. 
l11ere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the 
jurisdiction, and there is eve1y reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released. 
For the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorai1dum, and as fu1ther discussed below, the 
defendai1t poses a cleai· 1isk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her 
continued appeai·ance in this case. Among other concerns: (1) she is a citizen of a country that 
does not extradite its own citizens; (2) she appeai·s to have access to considerable wealth 
1 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page46 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 3 of 19 
domestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly 
declines to provide the Comt with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears 
to be skilled at living in hiding. l11ese are glaring red flags, even before the Comt considers the 
gravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if convicted at trial. 
Instead of attempting to address the 1isks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to 
extraordinfily financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in 
France, and who has ah-eady demonstrated a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendfil1t 
instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more thfil1 fill unsecured bond. Among other 
things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole secmity a 
prope1ty that is beyond the te1Tit01y and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is 
of no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, fill unknown number of whom 
even reside in the United States, and none of whose assets fil·e identified. The Court filld the 
Government have no info1mation whatsoever regfil·ding whether these co-signers would be able to 
able to pay the proposed 5 million bond should the defendfil1t flee - or it~ of equal concern, the 
co-signers fil·e themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so. 
l11e defendant does not identity what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern Distlict of 
New York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the fil·ea. And most importantly, tl1e 
defendant's memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her own 
fmfil1ces or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Comt the ve1y information 
that would info1m any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant - and 
which the Government submits would reveal the defendant's financial means to flee and live 
comfo1tably abroad for the rest of her life.

Finally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic is - and should be - a 
relevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. However, the Bureau of P1isons ("BOP") 
is taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason 
why she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are curTently detained at 
the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") pending hial, including defendants who have medical 
conditions that place them at heightened 1isk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their own 
defense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to 
eve1y prehial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special ti·eahnent she requests. 
TI1e defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties, 
she has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant's crimes seek 
her detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably 
assure the defendant's appearance, the Government urges the Corut to detain her. 
ARGUMENT 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk - the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the sti·ength of the evidence, and the hist01y and characte1istics of the defendant -
weigh sti·ongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do absolutely 
nothing to mitigate those 1isks. 
I. 
The Defendant's Victims Seek Detention 
As the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act (' CVRA"), a crime 
victim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the disti·ict cou1t, 
including proceedings involving release. 
18 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). 
Consistent with that 
requirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in c01mection with

their client opposes bail for the defendant, and has asked the Government to convey that view to 
the Comt. The Government also expects that one or more victims will exercise their right to be 
heard at the July 14, 2020 hearing in this matter, and will urge the Court not to grant bail. More 
generally, as noted above, the Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the 
victims will be denied justice in this case. That outcome is unacceptable to both the victims and 
the Government. 
II. 
The Government's Case Is Strong 
The defendant's motion argues, in a concluso1y fashion, that the Government's case must 
be weak because the conduct charged occmTed in the 1990s. That argument, which ignores the 
many specific allegations in the Indictment, could not be more wrong. As the superseding 
indictment (the ' Indictment'') makes plain, multiple victims have provided detailed, credible 
evidence of the defendant's criminal conduct. And while that conduct did take place a number of 
years ago, it is unsurprising that the victims have been unable to forget the defendant's predatory 
conduct after all this ti.me, as traumatic childhood experiences often leave indelible marks. The 
recollections of the victims bear striking resemblances that co1rnborate each other and provide 
compelling proof of the defendant's active pa1ticipation in a disturbing scheme to groom and 
sexually abuse mi.nor girls. In addition to compelling victim accounts, as the Government has 
explained, the victims' accounts are co1Toborated by documentary evidence and other witnesses. 
In paiticular, the victims' accom1ts are supported by contemporaneous documents and 
records, such as flight records, diaiy entries, and business records. The powerful testimony of 
these victims, who had strikingly similar experiences with Maxwell, together with documentary 
4 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page49 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 6 of 19 
evidence and witness testimony, will conclusively establish that the defendant groomed the victims 
for sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. 1 
The defendant's motion alludes to defenses in this case, all of which are legal or procedural 
in nature, and none of which pass muster, let alone counsel in favor of bail. To begin with, the 
notion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
(''NP A") between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida 
(' SDFL") is absurd. That agreement affords her no protection in this District, for at least three 
reasons. First, the defendant was not a paity to that agreement nor named in it as a third-pai·ty 
beneficiaiy, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights 
under the NP A. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement 
she was not a paity to ai1d that does not even identify her by naine could possibly be invoked to 
bar her prosecution. Second, ai1d equally i.mpo1tant, the NP A does not bind the Southern District 
of New York, which was not a paity to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 
672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam) ("A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States 
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.")); United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 
(2d Cir. 2010). This rnle applies even when the text of the agreement refers to the signing party 
as the "Government." Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. 
Thi.rd, ai1d perhaps most impo1tai1t, even assuming the NP A could be read to protect this 
defendant and bind this Office, which are both legally unsound propositions, the Indictment 
1 Additionally, and beyond the strong evidence set forth in the Indictment, in just the past week, 
and in response to the chai·ges against the defendant being made public, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI") ai1d the U.S. Attorney's Office have been in touch with additional 
individuals who have expressed a willingness to provide info1mation regai·di.ng the defendant. The 
Government is in the process of receiving and reviewing this additional evidence, which has the 
potential to make the Government's case even stronger. 
5 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page50 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 7 of 19 
charges conduct not covered by the NP A, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 
2001 to 2007, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations 
of statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government fu1ther notes that the 
Indictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two 
of the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL, 
and had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2019. 
or is there any force to the defendant's assertion - without explanation, much less legal 
authority - that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its 
opening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which pe1mits the 
prosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim. 
The defendant's claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in 
law. For similar reasons, the Comt should not give any weight to the defendant's bare assertions 
that the indictment is somehow "legally flawed" in unspecified ways or that the perjmy counts are 
' subject to dismissal" for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at 19. These conclusory 
claims are baseless. 
ill. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight 
As the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant's international ties, 
considerable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is 
fu1ther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite 
its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed fu1ther below, 
the defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The 
defendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that 
would tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not 
6 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page51 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 8 of 19 
appear to depend on any job - or to have depended on any employment in the past 30 years - for 
the privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly 
has the means to flee. 
More troubling still, the defendant's conduct at the time of her a1Test fllither underscores 
the risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents anived at the defendant's remote prope1ty in New 
Hampshire on the morning of July 2, 2020, they discovered the prope1ty was barred by a locked 
gate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later dete1mined to be 
a private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they 
announced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a 
window, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee 
to another room in the house, quickly shutting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced 
to breach the door in order to enter the house to aiTest the defendai1t, who was found in an interior 
room in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also 
noticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effo1t to evade 
detection, not by the press or public, which of comse would have no ability to trace her phone or 
intercept her communications, but by law enforcement. 
Following the defendant's ai-rest, the FBI spoke with the secmity guai·d, who informed the 
agents that the defendant's brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of 
the British militaiy to guard the defendai1t at the New Hainpshire prope1ty, in rotations. The 
defendant provided one of the guai·ds with a credit card in the saine naine as the LLC that had 
pmchased the New Hainpshire prope1ty in cash. The guard info1med the FBI that the defendant 
had not left the prope1ty during his time working there, and that instead, the guai·d was sent to 
7 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page52 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 9 of 19 
make purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be 
no question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding. 
The defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by 
arguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press attention. This argument entirely 
misses the point. First, the defendant's conduct is clearly relevant to the Court's assessment of her 
risk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so 
indefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be attributed solely to her desire 
to avoid media attention, that should give the Corut se1ious concerns about what steps she would 
be willing to take to avoid federal p1ison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures 
to conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this Distiict - and after the Government announced 
that its investigation into Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing - cannot be ignored. To the 
contrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also 
sought to evade detection by law enforcement. 
In attempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant 
points to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government's 
investigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the countly during an 
ongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world 
of ditforence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts 
by a federal grand jruy. The defendant now faces the reality of se1ious charges, suppo1ted by 
significant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in p1ison. The return of the 
indictment fundamentally alters the defendant's incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far 
beyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation ( one the defendant may have 
wrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has 
8 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page53 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 10 of 19 
spent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before 
her aiTest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had gotten away with her crimes. That 
illusion has now been shattered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources 
to flee. 
Moreover, the defendant's willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct, 
including some of the conduct chai·ged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her t:J.ue motive has 
been and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather tha11 to avoid the media. 
As alleged in the Indictment, in 2016, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address 
her conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies ai·e, of course, 
the subject of two counts of pe1jury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to 
protect herself. l11e defenda11t's lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about tlusting 
this defendant to comply with conditions of bail. 
IV. 
The Defendant's Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance 
In its opening memora11dum, the Government highlighted the defonda11t's extensive mea11S 
to flee and her opaque finances. In her respo11Se, the defenda11t's brief provides zero information 
about her assets in the United States or abroad. l11e Court should be t:J.·oubled by this. First, so 
far as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty 
of pe1jury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Cou1t has no reliable 
insight into the magnitude or scope of the defenda11t's resources.2 However, what the Court does 
have ai·e st:J.·ong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large 
prope1ty she was found on, the private security guai·d being retained to live with her on that 
2 The Government understands from Pret:J.·ial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has 
less than a million dollai·s in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed 
below, the Cou1t should have se1ious pause before accepting this unverified info1mation. 
9 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page54 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 11 of 19 
prope1ty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral. 
Indeed, it is revealing that the defendant's memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets 
to which she plainly has access. Without knowing the full scope of the defendant's fmancial 
resources, it would be impossible for the Comt to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of 
bail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has 
met her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed 
to provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of pe1jmy. 
Although the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the 
defendant's continued appearance, the defendant's proposed bail package offers almost no security 
whatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and 
is a citizen of a countly that does not exti·adite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged 
with serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors - and yet, she asks the Comt to 
grant her bail secured only by a foreign prope1ty, which provides effectively no security at all. 
Indeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has 
not offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she 
offers as security a foreign prope1ty, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical matter, the 
Government has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail 
fodeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen's assets abroad or sell property 
in another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be 
required to attempt to litigate a property dispute in another countly, with a lengthy process and an 
uncertain outcome. 
Additionally, the defendant proffers no info1mation about her proposed co-signers other 
than that they are friends and relatives - in particular, she provides no infmmation about the assets 
10 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page55 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 12 of 19 
of those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to 
collect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to know whether her proposed 
co-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant's freedom 
for 5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant's means. In any event, as 
fu1ther described below, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-
signers whole if she were to flee. 
l11e defendant's failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial 
information about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jani.ng because she appears to 
have access to millions of dollars, p1i.ncipally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant 
has been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the "Swiss Bank") and multiple 
accounts with at least one bank headquaitered in Englai1d (the "English Bailk"). In 2018 ai1d 2019, 
Form 114 (' FBAR") submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury 
Depaitment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over 2 million. 
In cmmection with the Swiss Bank, the defendai1t appeai·s to be the grai1tor of a trust account 
(the "Trust Account") with a balance in June 2020 of more thai1 4 million. Among other 
transactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately 500,000 in Mai·ch 2019 
from one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trnst Account, and records fruther reflect a 
trai1sfer between those same accounts in June 2019 of more than 750,000. The Trustees of the 
tlust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevai1t Trnst Account 
documents, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally, 
the defendant was aiTested last week at a prope1ty in New Hampshire that was purchased for more 
than 1 million in cash in December 2019. It is unknown whether the defendai1t purchased the 
prope1ty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario 
11

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 13 of 19 
should raise concerns about the defendant's access to financial resources that would enable her to 
flee. 
Moreover, and as set fo1th in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been 
associated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2016 to the present, and during that period, 
the maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded 20 million. l110se accounts 
engaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently 
as 2019. To the extent the defendant now refuses to account for her ownership of or access to vast 
wealth, it is not because it does not exist - it is because she is attempting to hide it. 
l11e defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the 
Comt. In pruticular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to 
prevent the defendru1t's flight after it has been removed At best, home confinement ru1d electronic 
monitoring would reduce her head strut should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United 
States v. Banki, 10 Cr. 008 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21 , 2010) (denying bail to a naturalized 
citizen who was native to Irru1, who was single ru1d childless ru1d who faced a statutory maximum 
of20 years' imprisonment, ru1d noting that electronic monitoring is "hru·dly foolproof."), aff'd, 369

l11e defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate 
family members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her 
siblings, as her time in hiding makes cleru·, she is cleru·ly capable of maintaining those relationships 
remotely, which of comse she could continue to do from abroad. Moreover, she has citizenship in

a country that does not extr·adite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has eve1y 
motivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. 
Supp. 3d 246, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) ("l TJhe combination of Defendant's alleged deceptive actions, 
access to substantial financial resources, frequent international tr·avel, complete lack of ties to the 
United States, and extensive ties to foreign countr·ies without extr·adition demonstr·ates Defendant

3681423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016)). The defendant's proposed bail package is essentially 
nothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to CoUit. Given the gravity of the charged 
crimes, the defendant's substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under 
oath, the CoUit should take the proposed bail package for what it is w01th: nothing. 
V. 
The COVID-19 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant's Release 
Finally, the cmTent pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, comts in 
this district have regularly rejected applications for release based on asse1tions about the 
generalized 1isks of COVID-19. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. 19 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2020 
WL 1847914, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020) (Gardephe, J.) (denying bail application by defendant

than any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the 
many inmates awaiting trial there.3 
Tue vims, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates' health, 
but the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by 
COVID-19 and other health issues. The MDC's response to the pandemic was the subject of 
extensive evidentiary hearings in the context of a civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York. 
See Chunn v. Edge, No. 20 Cr. 1590, 2020 WL 3055669 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2020). In Chunn, the 
District Comt conducted extensive fact gathering about the conditions at the MDC before 
concluding that "MDC officials have recognized COVID-19 as a serious threat and responded 
aggressively." Id. at *l; see also id at 25 ("The MDC's response to COVID-19 has been 
aggressive and has included, among other steps, massively restricting movement within the 
facility, enhancing sanitation protocols, and creating quarantine and isolation units. And the data-
though limited-suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-19 
thus far."). 
Numerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on asse1tions 
about the hypothetical risks of COVID-19, including multiple cases involving defendants who, 
unlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions. See, e.g., United States v. Hanes-
Calugaru, No. 19 Cr. 651, ECF No. 257 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2020) (Swain, J.) (denying pre-trial

following new CDC guidance (see ECF Nos. 239, 242, 257)); United States v. Cuny, 19 Cr. 742,

hurdle" to the defendant's ability to flee. Opposition Memorandum at 16. Tue Government 
submits that the defendant has the means and resources to find her way out of the country, and a 
sho1t quarantine pe1iod abroad would be a small price to pay to avoid years in p1ison.

them at heightened 1isk with respect to COVID-19, but cou1ts nevertheless denied their

applications in view of the applicable factors under the Bail Reform Act. This Court should reach 
the same conclusion based on the extraordinaiy risk of flight described in detail above. 
The defendant's argument that bail is required for her to prepare her defense is equally 
unpersuasive. Judges in this district have repeatedly held that the current restrictions on inmate 
access to counsel do not waiTant releasing defendants who should othe1wise be detained under the 
Bail Refo1m Act. See United States v. Tolentino, 20 Cr. 007 (DLC), 2020 WL 1862670, at *2 
(S.D . .Y. Apr. 14, 2020); United States v. Adamu, 18 Cr. 601 (PGG), 2020 WL 1821717, at *6 
(Apr. 10, 2020); United States v. Brito, 20 Cr. 63 (PGG), 2020 WL 2521458, at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y. 
May 17, 2020); United States v. Ellison, 18 Cr. 834 (PAE), 2020 WL 1989301, at *1 -2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 27), United States v. Melamed, No. 19 Cr. 443 (LAK.), 2020 WL 1644205, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 2, 2020); United States v. Pena, No. 18 Cr. 640 (RA), 2020 WL 1674007, at *l (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 6, 2020). Just last week, a district judge in the Eastern District of New York denied bail to a 
defendant who ai·gued that restricted access to his counsel at the MDC required his release, while 
noting the volume of decisions reaching the saine conclusion. United States v. Shipp, No. 19 Cr. 
299 (NGG), 2020 WL 3642856, *3-4 (E.D.N.Y. July 6, 2020) (collecting cases). 
This Comt's decision in Stephens does not compel a different result here. In that case, this 
Comt concluded that bail was necessaiy in order to permit the defendant to prepare for a significant 
heaiing, which was scheduled for six days later. United States v. Stephens, No. 15 Cr. 95 (AJN), 
2020 WL 1295155, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mai·. 19, 2020) (finding that the limitations on the defenda11t's 
access to counsel "impacts the Defenda11t's ability to prepare his defenses to the alleged violation 
of supervised release in advance of the merits hea1ing scheduled for March 25, 2020."). By 
contrast, no evidentiaiy heai·ings have been requested, much less scheduled, in this case, and a trial 
date has not yet been set. See United States v. Gon:::,a/e:::,, No. 19 Cr. 906 (JMF), 2020 WL 1911209, 
16

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 18 of 19 
at * 1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020) ("Gonzalez fails to demonstrate that temporaiy release is 
'necessaiy' for the prepai·ation of his defense because, among other things, his trial is not scheduled 
for another five months."); United States v. Eley, No. 20 Cr. 78 (AT), 2020 WL 1689773, at * 1 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020) ("Defendant's request for release is not compelled under the Sixth 
Amendment; with trial scheduled for nine months from now, this case is distinguishable from other 
instances in which an imminent evidentiai·y hearing may supp01t a defendant's temporai·y 
release."). 
In fact, the defenda11t's own motion makes cleai· that the MDC has been responsive to 
defense counsel's concerns and has ensured that they have access to their client. As their motion 
notes, the MDC provided defense counsel with access to their client within three hours of a request 
eai·lier this week, despite having zero notice a11d receiving the request after close of business in the 
evening. See Opposition Memora11dum at 12. For non-emergencies, defense counsel ca11 avail 
themselves of the scheduling system that has been instituted at the MDC to request regulai· calls 
with their client a11d will be able to coordinate with MDC legal counsel should an urgent need 
a11se.

CONCLUSION 
As set fo1th above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. l11e Government respectfully 
submits that the defendant cannot meet her burden of overcoming the statuto1y presumption in 
favor of detention. l11ere are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in 
corut proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.

THE COURT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  This is
Judge Nathan presiding.
This is United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 
330.   
I will take appearances from counsel, beginning with 
counsel for the defendant. 
MS. MOE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Mark Cohen,
Cohen & Gresser, for Ms. Maxwell.  Also appearing with me today
is my partner Chris Everdell of Cohen & Gresser and Jeff
Pagliuca and Laura Menninger of the Haddon Morgan firm.  Good
afternoon, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen.  
And for the government. 
MS. MOE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Alison Moe for
the government.  I'm joined by my colleagues Maurene Comey and
Alex Rossmiller.  And also, with the court's permission, we
learned that the executive staff for the U.S. Attorney's office
were unfortunately not able to Connecticut at the overflow
dial-in so, with the court's permission, we would like to dial
them in from a phone here if that's acceptable to the court.
THE COURT:  The last word, the overflow dial-in was
not full.  Just a moment and we will make sure that they can
connect in.
And let me say good afternoon, Ms. Maxwell, as well. 
THE DEFENDANT:  Good afternoon, Judge.

THE COURT:  Ms. Maxwell, are you able to hear me and
see me okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, thank you.
THE COURT:  And are you able to hear Mr. Cohen and
counsel for the United States as well?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  All right.  If at any point you have
difficulty with any of the technology, you can let someone
there know right away, let me know, and we will pause the
proceedings before going any further.  Okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Thank you, Judge.
THE COURT:  All right.
Just a minute while we check on the call-in line.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
(Pause)
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, apologies.  We have also heard
from colleagues in the office that the line is full.  We have,
however, been able to dial in the executive staff to a phone
number here and my understanding is that they can hear and
participate that way, if that's acceptable to the court.  But
of course we defer to the court's preference.
THE COURT:  We are concerned about feedback from being
on a speakerphone in that room.  The phone number for
nonspeaking co-counsel that was provided, that line is not
full, and I would assume the executive leadership of the office

falls within that category, so they may call in to that number.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.  We will do
that.
THE COURT:  All right.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  Then we will go
ahead and proceed.
I have called the case.  I have taken appearances.
Counsel, let me please have oral confirmation that the court
reporter is on the line.
THE COURT REPORTER:  Good afternoon, your Honor.
Kristen Carannante.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon, and thank you so much.
We also have on the audio line Pretrial Services
Officer Leah Harmon and -- 
THE PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICER:  Hello, your Honor.
Good afternoon.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you.
We are here today for the arraignment, the initial
scheduling conference, and bail hearing in this matter.
As everyone knows, we are in the middle of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  I am conducting this proceeding remotely, 
pursuant to the authority provided by Section 15002 of the 
CARES Act and the standing orders issued by our Chief Judge 
pursuant to that act.

I am proceeding by videoconference, which I am
accessing remotely.  Defense counsel and counsel for the
government are appearing remotely via videoconference and the
defendant, Ms. Maxwell, is accessing this videoconference from
the MDC in Brooklyn.
Ms. Maxwell, I did confirm that you could hear me and
see me; and, again, if at any point you have any difficulty
with the technology, please let me know right away.  Okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Thank you, your Honor.  I will do
that.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  And if at any point you would
like to speak privately with Mr. Cohen, let me know that right
away, and we will move you and your counsel into a private
breakout room where nobody else will be able to see or hear
your conversation, okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Again, thank you, your Honor.  I
appreciate that.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Mr. Cohen, likewise, should you request to speak with
Ms. Maxwell privately, don't hesitate to say that.
MR. COHEN:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  We will turn now to the waiver of physical
presence.  I did receive a signed waiver of physical presence
form dated July 10, 2020.
Mr. Cohen, could you please is describe the process by

which you discussed with Ms. Maxwell her right to be present
and the indication of her knowing and voluntary waiver of that
right provided on this form.
MR. COHEN:  Yes, your Honor.  We, given the press of
time, we were not able to physically get the form to our
client, but my partner Chris Everdell and I went through it
with her, read it to her, and she gave us authorization to sign
on her behalf and that's reflected on the form in the boxes
where indicated, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Ms. Maxwell, is that an accurate
account of what occurred?
THE DEFENDANT:  That is completely accurate, your
Honor.  Yes.
THE COURT:  And you have had the form read to you or
you have it physically now at this point?  
THE DEFENDANT:  That is correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And you have had time to discuss it
with your attorney?
THE DEFENDANT:  I have, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And do you continue to wish to
waive your right to be physically present and instead to
proceed today by this videoconference proceeding?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, your Honor.

voluntary waiver of the right to be physically present for this

arraignment, scheduling conference, and bail hearing.
Counsel, as you know, to proceed remotely today, in
addition to the finding I have just made, I must also find that
today's proceeding cannot be further delayed without serious
harms to the interests of justice.
Ms. Moe, does the government wish to be heard on that? 
 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The government submits that proceeding remotely in 
this fashion would protect the interests of the parties and the 
safety in view of the pandemic.  We further submit that this 
proceeding can be conducted remotely with full participation of 
the parties in view of the preparation and steps everyone has 
taken to ensure proper participation. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Mr. Cohen?
MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, we have agreed to proceed
remotely as your Honor just laid out.
THE COURT:  Okay.  I do find that today's proceeding
cannot be further delayed without serious harms to the
interests of justice for, among other reasons, that the
defendant, who is currently detained, seeks release on bail.
The final preliminary matter I will address is public
access to the proceeding, which has garnered significant public
interest.  As I have indicated in prior orders, the court has

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

arranged for a live video feed of this proceeding to be set up
in the jury assembly room at the courthouse.  This is the
largest room available and, with appropriate social distancing,
it can safely accommodate 60 people.  The court has further
provided a live video feed to the press room at the courthouse
where additional members of the credentialed in-house press
corps can watch and hear the proceeding.
Additionally, the court has provided a live audio feed
for members of the public.  My prior order indicated that the
line can accommodate 500 callers, but with thanks of the court
staff, that capacity has been increased to 1,000 callers.
Lastly, the court has provided through counsel a
separate call-in line to ensure audio access to nonspeaking
co-counsel, any alleged victims identified by the government,
including those who wish to be heard on the question of
pretrial detention, and any family members of the defendant.
That line is operational now as well.
Counsel, beginning with Mr. Cohen, any objection to
these arrangements regarding public access?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Then I will make the following findings:
First, COVID-19 constitutes a substantial, if not 
overriding, reason that supports the court's approach to access

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

in this case.  As the chief judge of the district has 
recognized in order number 20MC176, COVID-19 remains a national 
emergency that restricts normal operations of the courts.  
Conducting this proceeding in person is not safely feasible.   
Second, the measures taken by the court are no broader 
than necessary to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.  
Although the number of seats in the jury assembly room is 
limited to 60, it is necessary to do so for public and 
courthouse staff safety and is closely equivalent to the number 
of people who would be able to watch an in-court proceeding in 
a regular-sized courtroom.  The number of people who will be 
able to hear the live audio of this proceeding far exceeds 
access under normal in-person circumstances.   
Lastly, given the safety and technology limitations, 
there are no reasonable alternatives to the measures the court 
has taken.   
Accordingly, the access provided is fully in accord 
with the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights. 
With those preliminary matters out of the way,
counsel, I propose we turn to the arraignment.
Ms. Moe, am I correct that this is an arraignment on
the S1 superseding indictment?
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Can you explain what the difference is
between the S1 and the original indictment?

MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The difference is a small ministerial correction, a 
reference to a civil docket number contained in the perjury 
counts, which are Counts Five and Six of the superseding 
indictment.  Aside from the alteration of those docket numbers, 
the reference to them, there are no other changes to the 
indictment. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Again, I will conduct the
arraignment on the S1 indictment.
Ms. Maxwell, have you seen a copy of the S1 indictment
in this matter?
THE DEFENDANT:  I saw the original indictment, your
Honor.  The original --
THE COURT:  Okay.
All right.  Mr. Cohen, did you have an opportunity to 
discuss with Ms. Maxwell the ministerial change that was 
completed by way of the superseding indictment? 
MR. COHEN:  Yes, yes, Judge.  We have, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Any objection to proceeding on the
arraignment of the S1 indictment, Mr. Cohen?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.
Ms. Maxwell, have you had an opportunity to discuss
the indictment in this case with your attorney?
THE DEFENDANT:  I have, your Honor.

will also ask you to indicate how you will ensure that the

and federal law disclosure obligations.   
Go ahead, Ms. Moe. 
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
With respect to the items that the government 
anticipates will be included in discovery in this case, we 
expect that those materials will include, among other items, 
search warrant returns, copies of search warrants, subpoena 
returns, including business records, photographs, 
electronically stored information from searches conducted on 
electronic devices.  In addition, the materials with respect to 
the core of the case also include prior investigative files 
from another investigation in the Southern District of Florida 
among other items.   
With respect to the status of discovery, the 
government has begun preparing an initial production and are 
prepared to produce a first batch of discovery as soon as a 
protective order is entered by the court. 
With respect to the status of the proposed protective
order, the government sent defense counsel a proposed
protective order last week.  We have touched base about the
status of that with defense counsel, and they conveyed that
they would like to continue reviewing and discussing it with
the government, which we plan to do shortly after this
conference, with an eye towards submitting a proposed
protective order to the court as soon as possible.  Following

the entry of that protective order, as I noted, your Honor, the
government is prepared to make a substantial production of
discovery.
Your Honor, in advance of the conference, the
government and defense counsel proposed a joint schedule for
discovery, motion practice, and a proposed trial date, in
particular, the date selected in that schedule with an eye
towards assuring that there was sufficient time for the
government to do a careful and exhaustive and thorough review
of all of the materials that I just referenced to make sure
that the government is complying with its discovery obligations
in this case, which we take very seriously.  We expect that the
bulk of the relevant materials will be produced in short order,
primarily by the end of this summer, with additional materials
to follow primarily in a category I mentioned before, your
Honor, of electronically stored information, which is subject
to an ongoing privilege review which we discussed and
communicated with defense counsel about.  We have proposed a
scheduling order again to be very thorough in our review of
discovery and in files in various places where they may be
located and we are taking an expansive and thoughtful approach
to our obligations in this case, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Let me just follow up specifically, since
you have referenced prior investigative files, to the extent we
have seen in other matters issues with complete disclosure of

materials, it has been in some instances due to precisely that
factor.  So has there been a plan developed to ensure that down
the road we are not hearing that there were delays or problems
with discovery as a result of the fact that part of the
disclosure obligation here includes materials from other
investigative files?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The files in particular that I am referring to are the 
files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in connection 
with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.  The 
physical files themselves were shipped to New York and are at 
the New York F.B.I. office.  They have been imaged and scanned 
and photographed to make sure that a comprehensive review can 
be conducted, and they are physically in New York so that we 
can have access to those files.  And again, as we have heard in 
ongoing information, we are particularly thoughtful about those 
concerns given the history of this case and the volume of 
materials and the potential sensitivities, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Beyond the paper files which you have just
indicated, the physical files, have you charted a path for
determining whether there is any other additional information
that must be disclosed?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, just to clarify, is your
question with respect to the previous investigation or -- I
apologize, your Honor.  I wasn't sure what you meant.

THE COURT:  Among other things, but, yes, I'm drilling
down specifically on that since that has been, in somewhat
comparable circumstances in other matters, the source of issues
related to timely disclosures.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Our team met personally
with the F.B.I. in Florida to make sure that we had the
materials, and it was represented to us that the materials that
the F.B.I. provided in Florida were the comprehensive set of
materials.  We will certainly have ongoing conversations to
make sure that that is the case and if, in our review of files,
we discover other materials, we will handle that with great
care, and we are particularly sensitive to that concern.
THE COURT:  And I expect here, and in all matters, not
just accepting of initial representations made regarding full
disclosure, but thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of
questions and issues with respect to actively retrieving any
appropriate files.  Are we on the same page, Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Very much so.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
With that, why don't you go ahead and lay out the
proposed schedule that you have discussed with Mr. Cohen, and
then I will hear from Mr. Cohen if he has any concerns with
that proposal.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
We would propose the completion of discovery, to

include electronic materials, to be due by Monday, November 9 
of this year, and following that we would propose the following 
motion schedule: that defense motions be due by Monday, 
December 21 of this year; that the government's response be due 
on Friday, January 22, 2021; and that replies be due on Friday, 
February 5, 2021. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Cohen, based on the
government's description of both the quantity and quality of
discovery, is that schedule that's been laid out sufficient
from your perspective to do everything that you need to do?
MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, just two points in that
regard.  I think counsel for the government did not mention in
the e-mail we had sent to your Honor's law clerk that August 21
would be the deadline for production of search warrant
applications and the subpoena returns.  I think she just failed
to mention it for the record.  That would also be part of the
schedule.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, do you agree? 
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.  I apologize.
We did include that in the e-mail to your Honor's chambers, and
that is correct.
And thank you, counsel, for clarifying that. 
MR. COHEN:  Two additional points, your Honor.  The
trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to

the court's approval, assumes there will be no substantive
superseding indictment.  If there is one, which the government
has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I assume not
at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not
just trial schedule but other schedule as well.
And I am assuming -- we take your Honor's points about
the issues on discovery, and we agree with them, particularly
as to electronic discovery; and I am assuming that, as this
unfolds, if we spot an issue we think needs further attention,
we will be able to bring it to the court's attention.
Those are my points. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Let me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a 
representation but I will ask if you do anticipate at this time 
filing any further superseding indictments adding either 
defendants or additional charges? 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, our investigation remains
ongoing, but at this point we do not currently anticipate
seeking a superseding indictment.
THE COURT:  All right.  So with that -- and also let
me ask, Ms. Moe, just because it is next on my list, what
processes the government has put in place to notify alleged
victims of events and court dates pursuant to the Crime Victims
Rights Act.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  I am happy to give the

courts details about the process we used for notification for
this conference and also what we anticipate to use going
forward.
So to begin with, the government notified relevant
victims or their counsel immediately following the arrest of
the defendant on July 2 about the fact of the arrest and the
initial presentment scheduled for later that day.
In advance of the initial presentment, those victims 
were provided the opportunity to participate through the 
court's protocol for appearances in New Hampshire.   
On July 7, the court set a date for arraignment and 
bail hearing on July 14, today, and by the following day from 
the court's order, the government had notified relevant victims 
or their counsel of that scheduling order and advised victims 
and counsel of their right to be heard in connection with the 
bail hearing.   
On that same day, the government posted to its victim 
services website, including a link to the indictment, as well 
as scheduling information relating to the hearing.   
On July 9, the government updated the website to 
include the dial-in information that the court provided.   
In addition, on July 8, the government sent letter 
notifications to individuals who have identified themselves as 
victims of Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein that were not 
specifically referenced in the indictment.

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
 
Our process going forward, as we noted in that letter 
to victims, is that we will use an opt-in process so we will 
not notify individuals who do not wish to receive additional 
notifications but will continue to provide ongoing information 
about upcoming conferences and relevant details on the 
government's victim services website. 
With respect to this specific hearing, the government
has been advised by counsel to three victims of their interest
in being heard in connection with today's bail proceeding.  One
victim's views are expressed in the government's reply
memorandum; one victim has submitted a statement to the
government and asked that the government read it during today's
proceedings; and one victim has asked to be heard directly, and
the government anticipates that she will make a statement at
any time during this proceeding as necessitated by the court.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Then, with that, returning to the schedule that you 
have laid out, and I thank counsel for conferring in advance, 
as to a proposed schedule, Mr. Cohen, let me just finalize if 
you agree to the proposed schedule that has been laid out by 
Ms. Moe and supplemented by you? 
MR. COHEN:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
And, Ms. Moe, you continue to support the proposed 
schedule?

MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Then I will set the schedule
as jointly proposed by counsel.  To reiterate, I am setting --
let me ask, Ms. Moe, if we are going to proceed to trial, how
long of a trial does the government anticipate?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, the government anticipates that
its case in chief would take no more than two weeks.  But in
terms of the length of time to block out a trial date, in an
abundance of caution, in view of the need for jury selection
and the defense case, we would propose blocking three weeks for
trial.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
With that, I will adopt the schedule.  I hereby set
trial to commence on July 12, 2021, with the following pretrial
schedule:
Initial nonelectronic disclosure generally, to include
search warrant applications and subpoena returns, to be due by
Friday, August 21, 20.
Completion of discovery, to include electronic
materials, to be due by Monday November 9, 2020.
Any initial pretrial defense motions, based on the
indictment or disclosure material and the like to be due by
Monday, December 21, 2020.
If any motions are filed, the government's response 
due by Friday, January 22, 2021.

If any motions seek an evidentiary hearing, I will

And, as indicated, trial to commence on July 12, 2021.   
In advance of trial, following motion practice, the 
court will put out a schedule regarding pretrial submissions, 
including in limine motions and the like. 
With that, counsel, other matters to discuss regarding
scheduling?
Mr. Cohen? 
MR. COHEN:  Not at this time, your Honor, not from the
defense at this time.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  Nothing further from the government
regarding scheduling, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And, Ms. Moe, does the government
seek to exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  In view of the schedule
and the interests of producing discovery and permitting time
for the defense to review discovery, contemplate any motions
and pursue those motions, the government would seek to exclude
time from today's date until our trial date as court set forth
today.

THE COURT:  Mr. Cohen, any objection?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  I will exclude time from today's
date until July 12, 2021, which I have said is a firm trial
date.  I do find that the ends of justice served by excluding
this time outweigh the interests of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial.  The time is necessary for the
production of discovery and view of that by defense, time for
the defense to consider and prepare any available motions and,
in the absence of resolution of the case, time for the parties
to prepare for trial.
To Ms. Moe and Mr. Cohen, although I have not set an 
interim status conference in the case, we do have our motion 
schedule, but for both sides, if at any point you wish to be 
before the court for any reason, simply put in a letter and we 
will get something on the calendar as soon as we conceivably 
can.  
With that, Mr. Cohen, let me ask counsel if there is
any reason that we should not turn now to the argument for
bail?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  All right.  I will hear on that question.
It is the government's motion for detention, so I propose

hearing from the government first, and then any alleged victims
who have indicated that they wish to be heard pursuant to 18
U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), and then I will hear from Mr. Cohen.
Any objection to proceeding thusly, Mr. Cohen? 
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
Your Honor, as we set forth in our moving papers, the
government strongly believes that this defendant poses an
extreme risk of flight.  Pretrial Services has recommended
detention, the victims seek detention, and the government
respectfully submits that the defendant should be detained
pending trial.
Your Honor, there are serious red flags here.  The
defendant has significant financial means.  It appears that she
has been less than candid with Pretrial Services.  She has not
come close to thoroughly disclosing her finances to the court.
She has strong international ties and appears to have the
ability to live beyond the reach of extradition.  She has few,
if any, community ties, much less a stable residence that she
can propose to the court to be bailed to.  And she has a strong
incentive to flee to avoid being held accountable for her
crimes.
Because the defendant is charged with serious offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors, your Honor, there is a

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
 
legal presumption that there are no conditions that could 
reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the 
defendant has not come anywhere close to rebutting that 
presumption. 
Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the
offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in
this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting
minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to
travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in
a conspiracy to do the same.  The indictment further charges
that the defendant perjured herself, that she lied under oath
to conceal her crimes.
Your Honor, the charged conduct in this case is
disturbing and the nature and circumstances of the offense are
very serious.  The defendant is charged with participating in a
conspiracy to sexually exploit the vulnerable members of our
community.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims, I'm
not going to go into details, your Honor, about the particular
victims beyond what's contained in the indictment and our
briefing; but, as the indictment alleges, the defendant enticed
and groomed girls who were as young as 14 years old for sexual
abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, a man who she knew was a predator
with a preference for underaged girls.  The indictment alleges
that the defendant participated in some of these acts of abuse
herself, including sexualized massages in which the victims

were sometimes partially or fully nude.  She also encouraged
these minors to engage in additional acts of abuse with Jeffrey
Epstein.  The indictment makes plain, your Honor, this was not
a single incident or a single victim or anything isolated but,
instead, it was an ongoing scheme to abuse multiple victims for
a pattern of years.  This is exceptionally serious conduct.
Given the strength of the government's evidence and
the serious charges in the indictment, there is an incredibly
strong incentive for the defendant to flee, an incentive for
her to become at that fugitive to avoid being held accountable
and to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.
The history and characteristics of the defendant 
underscores the risk of flight that she poses.  The Pretrial 
Services report confirms that the defendant has been moving 
from place to place for some time, your Honor; and most 
recently it appears that she spent the last year making 
concerted efforts to conceal her whereabouts whilst moving 
around New England, most recently to New Hampshire, which I 
will discuss momentarily with respect to that particular --  
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe? 
MS. MOE:  -- property.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, there is one assertion in the
defense papers that I don't think I have seen the government's
response to, and that is the contention that Ms. Maxwell,
through counsel, kept in touch with the government since the

arrest of Mr. Epstein.  Is that accurate and did that include
information as to her whereabouts?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, that information did not include
information about her whereabouts for starters; and, second,
your Honor, the defendant's communications through counsel with
the government began when the government served the defendant
with a grand jury subpoena following the arrest of Jeffrey
Epstein.  So it is unsurprising that her counsel reached out to
the government, which is in the ordinary course when an
investigation becomes overt.
The government's communications with defense counsel 
have been minimal during the pendency of this investigation.  
Without getting into the substance, those contacts have not 
been substantial, your Honor.  And to the court's question, 
they certainly have not included any information about 
defendant's whereabouts. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
It appears that the defendant has insufficient ties to
motivate her to remain in the United States.  With respect to
her family circumstances, she does not have children, she does
not appear to reside with any immediate family members, and she
doesn't have any employment that would require her to remain in
the United States.
But, by contrast, she has extensive international

ties.  While she is a naturalized citizen of the United States, 
she is a citizen of France and the United Kingdom.  She grew up 
in the United Kingdom and has a history of extensive 
international travel.  She owns a property in the 
United Kingdom.  Your Honor, there is a real concern here that 
the defendant could live beyond the reach of extradition 
indefinitely.   
The government has spoken with the Department of 
Justice attachés in the United Kingdom and France.   
With respect to France, we have been informed that 
France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States 
as a matter of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of 
the United States.   
As well, we have been informed that there is an 
extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United 
States.  The extradition process would be lengthy, the outcome 
would be uncertain, and it's very likely that the defendant 
would not be detained during the pendency of such an 
extradition proceeding.   
Those circumstances raise real concerns here.  
Particularly because the defendant appears to have the 
financial means to live beyond the reach of extradition 
indefinitely.  As we detailed in our briefing, your Honor, the 
defendant appears to have access to significant and 
undetermined and undisclosed wealth.

In addition to the financial information described in 
the government's memoranda, we note, your Honor, that in the 
Pretrial Services report it appears that the defendant tried 
initially to brush off the subject of her finances when the 
Pretrial Services officer asked her, noting that she didn't 
have those details.  The defendant ultimately provided limited, 
unverified, and questionable information that now appears in 
the Pretrial Services report.  She listed bank accounts 
totaling less than a million dollars and a monthly income of 
nothing.  Zero dollars per month of income.   
In addition to the matter of her finances, the report 
raises other concerns about whether the defendant has been 
fully transparent with the court or whether she is being 
evasive. 
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, you have emphasized the
indication on the financial report of zero dollars of the
income.  Does the government think that there is income?  Is
there some uncertainty as to whether that is investment income
as opposed to employment income or the like?  What is the
reason for the emphasis on that or to the extent it is an
indication that the government finds that implausible?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
Separate from the matter of employment, it is very 
unclear whether the defendant is receiving proceeds from trust 
accounts or an inheritance or means of other kinds.  It is

simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of 
assets and no other stream of income, especially given the 
lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the 
Pretrial Services report.  It just doesn't make sense.  Either 
there are other assets or there is other income.  We can't make 
sense of this lifestyle and this set of financial disclosures.  
This just doesn't make sense.  And as I will detail in a 
moment, your Honor, it is inconsistent with the limited 
reference we have been able to obtain as we have been making an 
effort to trace the defendant's finances.   
On that subject, your Honor, the report does raise 
concerns about whether the defendant has been fully transparent 
about her finances.  As one example, the defendant told 
Pretrial Services that the New Hampshire property was owned by 
a corporation, that she does not know the name of the 
corporation, but that she was just permitted to stay in the 
house.  It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming 
answer because it is implausible on its face and very 
confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire 
property.   
This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent 
who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that 
transaction in New Hampshire.  The real estate agent told the 
F.B.I. that the buyers to the house introduced themselves to

her as Scott and Janet Marshall, who both have British accents.  
Scott Marshall told her that the -- that he was retired from 
the British military and he was currently working on writing a 
book.  Janet Marshall described herself as a journalist who 
wants privacy.  they told the agent they wanted to purchase the 
property quickly through a wire and that they were setting up 
an LLC.  Those conversations took place in November 2019.  Your 
Honor, following the defendant's arrest, the real estate agent 
saw a photograph of the defendant in the media and realized 
that the person who had introduced herself as Janet Marshall, 
who had toured the house and participated in these 
conversations about the purchase, was the defendant, Ghislaine 
Maxwell.   
That series of facts, which I just learned about this 
morning, your Honor, are concerning for two reasons.  First, 
additionally, it appears that the defendant has attempted to 
conceal an asset from the court, and at the very least she has 
not been forthcoming in the course of her Pretrial Services 
interview; and, second, it appears that the defendant has used 
an alias and that she was willing to lie to hide herself and 
hide her identity and we discussed the additional indicia in 
our briefing your Honor.  So that raises real concerns. 
Moreover, the defendant's claims about her finances to
Pretrial Services should be concerning to the court for
additional reasons.

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, Ms. Moe, if I may pause you
before moving on from those points.
There is a basic dispute within the papers as to, I 
think, efforts similar to the ones you have described that are 
efforts to hide from authorities, which would certainly be an 
indication of risk of flight or whether, in light of the 
notoriety and public interest that the case has generated 
following the indictment of Mr. Epstein, whether it was an 
effort to protect privacy and hide from press for privacy 
reasons.   
How does the government suggest that that factual 
determination be resolved, if you agree that it should, and 
what is your general response to the veracity of that 
assertion? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
As we discussed in our reply brief, your Honor, in our
view, there is no question these circumstances are relevant to
the court's determination with respect to bail for a number of
reasons.
The first is, irrespective of the defendant's motive, 
these facts make clear to the court that the defendant has the 
ability to live in hiding, that she is good at it, that she is 
willing to do it even if it compromises her relationship and 
contacts with other people and, as the information provided by 
the real estate agent underscores, she is good at it and that

she passes.  In other words, even though, as defense claims, 
that she is widely known, that there is press everywhere, she 
was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate 
transaction under a fake name and not be detected.  So there 
really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie 
about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the 
means to do so.  All of those things should be extremely 
concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates 
whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live 
off the grid indefinitely.  A year is an extremely long period 
of time to live in hiding, undetected by the public.  And so 
all of those things are concerning. 
With respect to the question of motive, your Honor,
the government submits the court need not reach that ultimate
issue, but we noted, your Honor, that there are indicia during
the circumstances of the defendant's arrest that suggested that
there was a motive to evade detection by law enforcement.  But
the bigger picture, your Honor, is the defendant's --
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe -- 
MS. MOE:  -- ability -- 
THE COURT:  -- I was surprised that that information
wasn't provided until the reply brief.  Was there a reason for
that?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  The government wanted to
be very careful to make sure we had full and accurate

information.  So we were first notified about the circumstances
the morning of the defendant's arrest, but I wanted to
personally confer with the agent who was involved in breaching
the door and verify that before including that information in a
brief before the court.  That's the reason for the delay, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  But the government has done that
confirmation process and is confident of the information
provided and the basic contention there is -- the basic
contention there is that she resisted opening the door in the
face of being informed that authorities were seeking entry and
there is a suggestion of an effort to conceal location
monitoring of some type by placing a cell phone in foil of some
kind.
Could you explain what the government's understanding 
factually is and what you think I should derive from that? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
And, with apologies, we were very careful to make sure 
that the specific language in our briefing was accurate in 
consultation with the agents, so I don't want to add additional 
facts or speak extemporaneously about that; but, in short, that 
is correct that the defendant did not respond to law 
enforcement announcing their presence and directing her to open 
the door; that, instead, she left and went into a separate 
room.

k7e2MaxC kjc
 
And then, separately, the details about the cell 
phone, as the court noted, are contained in our brief and we 
submit that there could be no reason for wrapping a cell phone 
in tinfoil except for potentially to evade law enforcement, 
albeit foolishly and not well executed. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
I believe I was discussing the defendant's finances, 
which underscore the concern about the defendant's ability to 
flee and about her questionable candor to the court.  We submit 
there are concerns there for two reasons, your Honor.   
The first is that we learned that records relating -- 
reflecting to client information for a SWIFT bank include 
self-reported financial information from the defendant.  In 
other words, when the account was opened, there were 
disclosures made about the defendant's finances.  In those 
records, which are dated January 2019, the defendant's annual 
income is listed as ranging from $200,000 to approximately half 
a million dollars.  And both her net worth and liquid assets 
are listed as ranging from $10 million and above.   
Second, as we noted in our reply, the defendant is the 
grantor of a trust account in the same SWIFT bank with assets 
of more than $4 million as of last month.  Bank documents 
reflect that the trust has three trustees, one of whom has the 
authority to act independently.  One of those trustees is a

relative of the defendant and the other appears to be a close 
associate. 
Despite having put millions of dollars into this
trust, your Honor, and despite its assets being controlled by a
relative and close associate, the defendant mentions it not
once in her motion before the court or in her Pretrial Services
interview; and, in fact, despite the fact that the government
said in its opening brief that the defendant's finances and her
uncertain amount of wealth, including issues about whether her
wealth was stored abroad, are serious concerns with respect to
the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's opposition does
not discuss this at all.  There is no mention of the
defendant's finances and no effort to address those concerns
whatsoever.
In sum, your Honor, the court has been given virtually 
no information about the defendant's possession of and apparent 
access to extensive wealth.  The court should not take that 
concealment, your Honor, we respectfully submit, as an 
invitation to demand further details, but instead to recognize 
that if the court can't rely on this defendant to be 
transparent at this basic initial stage, the court cannot rely 
on her to return to court if released.  In short, she has not 
earned the court's trust. 
Finally, your Honor, turning to the defendant's
proposed bail package, in light of all of the red flags here --

the defendant's demonstrated willingness and ability to live in
hiding, her ability to live comfortably beyond the reach of
extradition, her strong interactional ties and lack of
community ties, significant and unexplained wealth, and the
presumption of detention in light of very serious charges -- in
light of all that, your Honor, it is extremely surprising that
the defendant would propose a bail package with virtually no
security whatsoever.
In addition to failing to describe in any way the 
absence of proposed cosigners of a bond, the defendant also 
makes no mention whatsoever about the financial circumstances 
or assets of her spouse whose her identity she declined to 
provide to Pretrial Services.  There is no information about 
who will be cosigning this bond or their assets and no details 
whatsoever. 
The government submits that no conditions of bail
would be appropriate here.  But it is revealing, your Honor,
that the defendant had both declined to provide a rigorous,
verified accounting of her finances and that she does not
propose that she pledge any meaningful security for her
release.  She identifies no stable residence where she could
reside.  Instead, she proposes, among other proposals, that she
stay at a luxury hotel in Manhattan, the most transient type of
residence.  And it is curious, your Honor, that the defendant
offers to pay for a luxury hotel for an indefinite period and

yet does not offer to post a single penny in security for the
bond she proposes.
Your Honor, the defendant is the very definition of a
flight risk.  She has three passports, large sums of money,
extensive international connections, and absolutely no reason
to stay in the United States to face a potential significant
term of incarceration.
The government respectfully submits that the defendant 
can't meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption 
in favor of detention in this case.  There are no conditions of 
bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court 
proceedings in this case, and we respectfully request that the 
court detain the defendant pending trial. 
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Moe.
Just to make explicit what is clear by the 
government's written presentation and oral presentation, you 
are not resting your argument for detention on dangerousness to 
the community at all.  It is resting on risk of flight, 
correct? 
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, you have indicated that you have heard from
victims who are entitled, under federal law, to be heard at
this proceeding.  Could you indicate -- I think you indicated

that you have a written statement and then that there is an
alleged victim who wishes to be heard.  Is that correct?
MS. MOE:  That is correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Why don't you begin with the written
statement and then after that you can identify, as you like,
the alleged victim who wishes to be heard, and my staff will
unmute at that time that person so that they can be heard.
Go ahead. 
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
As I mentioned before, your Honor, the government has
received a written statement from a victim who prefers to be
referred to as Jane Doe today in order to protect her privacy.
The following are the words of Jane Doe which I will read from
her written statement.  
Jane Doe wrote: 
"I knew Ghislaine Maxwell for over ten years.  It was
her calculating and sadistic manipulation that anesthetized me,
in order to deliver me, with full knowledge of the heinous and
dehumanizing abuse that awaited me, straight to the hands of
Jeffrey Epstein.  Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have
done what he did.  She was in charge.  She egged him on and
encouraged him.  She told me of others she recruited and she
thought it was funny.  She pretends to care only to garner
sympathy, and enjoys drawing her victims in with perceived
caring, only to entrap them and make them feel some sense of

obligation to her through emotional manipulation.  She was a
predator and a monster.
"The sociopathic manner in which she nurtured our 
relationship, abused my trust, and took advantage of my 
vulnerability makes it clear to me that she would have done 
anything to get what she wanted, to satisfy Mr. Epstein.  I 
have great fear that Ghislaine Maxwell will flee, since she has 
demonstrated over many years her sole purpose is that of 
self-preservation.  She blatantly disregards and disrespects 
the judicial system, as demonstrated by her perjuring herself 
and bullying anyone who dared accuse her.   
"I have great fear that she may seek to silence those 
whose testimony is instrumental in her prosecution.  In fact, 
when I was listed as a witness in a civil action involving 
Maxwell, I received a phone call in the middle of the night 
threatening my then two-year-old's life if I testified.   
"I have fear speaking here today, even anonymously.  
However, I have chosen to implore the court not to grant bond 
for Ms. Maxwell because I know the truth.  I know what she has 
done.  I know how many lives that she has ruined.  And because 
I know this, I know she has nothing to lose, has no remorse, 
and will never admit what she has done.   
"Please do not let us down by allowing her the 
opportunity to further hurt her victims or evade the 
consequences that surely await her if justice is served.  If

she is out, I need to be protected.  I personally know her 
international connections that would allow her to go anywhere 
in the world and disappear at a moment's notice or make others 
disappear if she needs to."   
Your Honor, those are the words of Jane Doe. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, would you indicate how the victim who wishes 
to be heard should be recognized? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The government has been informed through the victim's 
counsel that the victim wishes to speak in her true name, which 
is Annie Farmer. 
THE COURT:  All right.  I will ask my staff to please
unmute Ms. Farmer.
MS. FARMER:  Can you hear me, your Honor?
THE COURT:  I can, Ms. Farmer.  You may proceed.
MS. FARMER:  Thank you.  I appreciate the opportunity
to speak.
I met Ghislaine Maxwell when I was 16 years old.  She 
is a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless 
other children and young women.  She has never shown any 
remorse for her heinous crimes, for the devastating, lasting 
effects her actions caused.  Instead, she has lied under oath 
and tormented her survivors.

The danger Maxwell must be taken seriously.  She has 
associates across the globe, some of great means.   
She also has demonstrated contempt for our legal 
system by committing perjury, all of which indicate to me that 
she is a significant flight risk.   
We may never know how many people were victimized by 
Ghislaine Maxwell, but those of us who survived implore this 
court to detain her until she is forced to stand trial and 
answer for her crimes. 
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Farmer.  All right.
And, Ms. Moe, is the government aware of any other
victims who are entitled to -- alleged victims who are entitled
to and wish to be heard at this proceeding?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  And, Ms. Moe, again, just to confirm,
because there was allusion in the statements of the victims to
fear and danger, the government is not seeking the court to
make any findings regarding danger to the community in coming
to its ultimate conclusion regarding pretrial detention,
correct?
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Moe, anything further
before I hear from Mr. Cohen?  
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you very much.

THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Moe.
Mr. Cohen, you may proceed.
MR. COHEN:  Thank you, your Honor.  Thank you very
much for the opportunity to be heard and also for accommodating
us with regard to the briefing schedule.  We appreciate that,
your Honor.
Your Honor, this is a very important proceeding for my
client.  It is critical and we submit, as we laid out in our
papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law,
none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's
presentation, she is -- she ought to be released on a bail
package with strict conditions, your Honor.
And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this 
during the COVID crisis, with the extent of discovery which was 
discussed earlier in the proceeding, that's going to take the 
government until November to produce to us, the notion of 
preparing a defense with our client while she is in custody 
under these conditions is just not realistic. 
I would also like to take a moment, your Honor, to
address a few things.  As we noted in our papers, our client is
not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially
endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up
in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to
portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister
person.

I do want to note, before I go further, to pick up on 
something the court said.  We have a proceeding now where the 
government is dribbling out facts or what they claim are facts 
that they could have and should have put in their opening 
memorandum so we would have had an opportunity to address them 
in writing before the court.  That's not how this is supposed 
to proceed, your Honor, and I thank your Honor for pointing 
that out.  Each -- 
THE COURT:  But, Mr. Cohen, please, by all means, you
have had the reply in the time that I have as well.  You
shouldn't hesitate to respond to any of those facts now.
MR. COHEN:  I appreciate that, your Honor, and I'm
going to proceed by proffer.  I would have preferred to be able
to submit something in writing, but obviously the way it was
done, we were deprived of that chance.
I also want to make clear that our client is not
Epstein.  She is not the monster that has been portrayed by the
media and now the government.  She is part of a very large and
close family, with extensive familial relations, extensive
friendships, extensive professional relationships.  Many of
these folks are on the call today, your Honor, and thank you,
your Honor, for making that available, though not identified,
which is something one would normally do in a traditional bail
hearing, because of the very real concern that they have and
our client has about her safety and about her privacy and her

confidentiality, as your Honor pointed out.  And as you will
see in a moment, that explains a lot of the spin the government
is putting on facts in this case.
Your Honor, people have received physical threats.  My 
client has received them.  Most of those close to her have 
received them.  They have received death threats.  They have 
been injured in their jobs, in their work opportunities, in 
their reputations, simply for knowing my client.  It's real.  
It's out there.  The facts of all the steps the court had to go 
through just to make the public access available to this 
proceeding is also a reality.   
There is a real thing out there having a very 
significant impact on our client.  There are folks who would 
normally come forward as part of a bail package who your Honor 
is aware of from the Pretrial Services report who can't now, at 
least at this point, because of the safety and confidentiality 
concerns.  Since last week our firm alone and my colleagues at 
Haddon Morgan have been besieged with e-mails and posts, some 
of them threatening.  This is all very real.  The government 
attempts to poo-poo it, to give it the back of the hand.  It is 
very real, and we submit it is a factor for the court to 
consider in its discretion. 
Before I go further, your Honor, I would like to go
through the 3142(g) analysis.  But before I do that, I would
like to make one comment about the CVR -- CVRA proceeding under

377(1), and we understand that the court is following the
statute.  The statute gives alleged victims the right to speak
through counsel, through the government, or directly, and be
heard, and we understand that, your Honor.
The question today before the court, we submit, is 
whether or not our client could be released or should be 
released on a condition or combination of conditions to assure 
her appearance.  And as to that question, the presentations 
today do not speak, they do not speak to risk of flight, and 
the courts have -- in this circuit have thought about and 
researched what weight should be given to that.  There is an 
opinion by Judge Orenstein in the Eastern District, United 
States v. Turner, from April 2005, not cited by the government, 
in which the court, after carefully surveying the legislative 
history and background of the CVRA and its interplay with the 
bail reform statute, concluded, "In considering how to ensure 
that the rights are afforded, I am cognizant that the new law 
gives crime victims a voice but not a veto.  Of particular 
relevance to this case, a court's obligation to protect the 
victim's rights and to carefully consider any objections that 
victim may have never requires it to deny a defendant release 
on conditions that will adequately secure the defendant's 
appearance," going on to cite the Senate legislative history 
that's being cited with approval of United States v. Rubin, 
also an Eastern District case.

So we understand why the court has to follow this 
process, but we submit that these presentations just are not 
relevant to the determination before the court today.  And, 
again, we don't have spin.  The big fact that the government, 
Ms. Moe tried to put before you through the victim is that 
supposedly someone had called in a civil action threatening the 
two-year-old child.  Notice how carefully that was phrased, 
your Honor.  It wasn't tied to Ms. Maxwell.  It's more spin, 
spin, spin.   
So we are here to consider bail.  We should consider 
the statute.  We should consider your Honor's guidance under 
the statute.  So let me just put that to one side.  I determine 
that that really disposes of the issue of what weight to give. 
In turning to the statute, your Honor, turning to the
factors, I don't want to spend a lot of time on the standard,
because I know your Honor is very familiar with it, but I do
want to point out that, in an opening brief and reply brief and
now an oral presentation, the government has not once
represented the standard to your Honor nor the burden that it
has.  And that is the statute, under 3142(c), says that "even
the case where there is not to be release ROR" -- which this is
not that case -- "the court shall order pretrial release
subject to the least restrictive condition or combination of
conditions."  That as you now read, of course, in light of
3142(e), (f), and (g), the provisions on detention, that the

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
 
law of the statute, by its structure, favors release.  The
Supreme Court has and the Second Circuit has advised us that a
very limited number of people should be detained prior to trial
because of the statute's structure, and the government nowhere
mentions that.  It basically acts as if all it has to do is
invoke the presumption on the client and then we are done, and
that's just not the legal standing, your Honor.
They also say nothing about the burden, which is
discussed on a case written for the Second Circuit by Judge
Raggi, and also the U.S. v. English case.  Without going into a
lot of detail, as the court is aware, the burden of persuasion
is the government's.  It never shifts.  The presumption can be
rebutted, and we submit it is here, and then it is the burden
of the government to show that the defendant is a risk of
flight and that there are no conditions or combination of
conditions to secure the release, which we submit they haven't
done here.
So let me turn, your Honor, if I may, to the factors 
under 3142(g), and before I do that, I also want to address 
some of the government's comments about the bail package.  We 
decided that we should come before your Honor with a package 
that was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided by 
the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by 
Pretrial Services and the court.  We didn't want to just walk 
in and say, Judge, we should be entitled to bail, please set

conditions.  So what we did is we went through all the high 
profile cases in this courthouse in the past several years and 
other cases, cases like Madoff, cases like Dreier, cases like 
Esposito, where Judge Marrero ruled in 2018 relating to an 
alleged member of organized crime, and we went through those 
cases to find the conditions that were listed under 3142(c), 
and in those cases that would we believe be relevant and 
applicable here, and we believe we have listed them all.  We 
understand that of course they would be subject to 
verification; and as we noted in our papers and I noted today, 
if we could have a guarantee of safety, if we could have a 
guarantee of privacy and confidentiality, and if the court 
required it, we believe there are other suretors who we could 
provide and perhaps other amounts of property as well.  That is 
an issue.  It is a real issue in this case.  It is something 
the government is just avoiding, but it is real.   
So let me talk now, your Honor, if I might, about the 
3142(g)(3) factors, which are the factors relating to the 
history of the defendant. 
The government said --
THE COURT:  Mr. Cohen, just before you move to that,
the three cases that you cited -- Esposito, Dreier, Madoff --
factually did any of those cases involve defendants with
substantial international and foreign connections?
MR. COHEN:  No, I don't believe they did.  The cases

that are relevant to that, which I was going to get to, your
Honor, are Khashoggi, U.S. v. Khashoggi, U.S. v. Bodmer, U.S.
v. Hanson, and Sabhnani itself, all of which involve defendants
with substantial connections.  
And I might follow up on your Honor's question, when 
you take off the spin and you take off the media -- and I'm 
going to get to it in a moment, because your Honor is going to 
allow me to respond -- here is their case:  Defendant is a 
citizen of more than one country, England and France, not 
exactly exotic places.  The defendant has three passports.  The 
defendant has traveled internationally in the past, not in the 
past year.  There is no refutation from the government on that, 
and they have been all over her travel records.  The defendant 
has resided here in the past year.  She has traveled 
internationally and, according to the government, she has 
financial means.  I will get to that in a moment, Judge.  But 
let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has 
financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.  
What do those cases teach?  They teach that that is something 
the court can and should address in the bail conditions.  They 
teach that they may require stricter bail conditions.  They 
don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all.  In 
Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the 
defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years, 
and they had many more international ties or international

travel than alleged as to our client, certainly in the past 
year, and strict release was approved with strict bail 
conditions. 
In Bodmer, which was before Judge Scheindlin in 2004,
the defendant was a Swiss citizen, and Switzerland had taken
the position it would not extradite its citizens for
proceedings in the United States.  And Judge Scheindlin
observed, well, if that becomes the test for bail, then no
citizen of Switzerland can ever get bail in the United States.
So, too, here.  If that's the test for France, then no French
citizen, under the government's reasoning, could ever get bail
in the United States.  
And in Bodmer it was even the allegation -- the case 
was a fraud case -- the allegation was that the defendant who 
was a Swiss attorney had, according to the government, been 
opening up Swiss accounts overseas and that that was some form 
of hiding.  Even with all that, the court said what many courts 
have said in this courthouse, to be addressed in the 
conditions.  Doesn't mean the government has carried its burden 
of showing there is no combination of conditions.   
In the Khashoggi case, written by Judge Keenan in 
1989, this was a person of extraordinary wealth, way more than 
anything the government alleges that our client has, he was, 
according to the government, a fugitive, a Saudi citizen who 
had not been in the United States for three years prior to his

arrest.  That defendant was released on bail conditions, strict 
bail conditions.   
And I mention Esposito, which is the 2019 case from 
Judge Marrero, that is a case in which the allegation was that 
the defendant was a senior ranking member of organized crime 
and had access to financial means as well.   
But all of those cases, as well as Madoff and Dreier, 
which I'm sure the court is familiar, with involved allegations 
of defendants with hundreds of millions of dollars, in all of 
those cases, the courts held that bail should be set subject to 
strict conditions.  And by the way, Judge, in all of those 
cases, the defendants appeared for court.  They all made 
appearances and appeared for trial.   
There are also cases from the context involving 
pornography or sex crime allegations, such as the Deutsch case 
coming from the Eastern District several years ago, the Conway 
case in the Northern District of California.  Again, 
understanding those are the allegations, the decision was made 
that release could be awarded on conditions. 
You even had one recently in the Second Circuit that
I'm sure everyone is familiar with United States v. Mattis,
different setting, because that was a dangerousness case and
the government is not proceeding on dangerousness grounds, but
that is the case where the allegation is that two attorneys
threw a Molotov cocktail into a police car; challenge to bail

appealed by the government; decision of the court, release on
strict conditions.  That is how the law works and comes out in
this area, but that's something, your Honor, that the
government did not address.  And if the court determines that
the conditions that we have proffered are insufficient or need
further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of
safety and confidentiality, we would recommend that the court
keep the proceeding open, and we should be able to get whatever
the court needs to satisfy it.  So that's the legal analysis
that was absent in the government's presentation today and its
papers.
Let me now, because I have to, because this has been
put out before your Honor in, of course, a public proceeding,
let me respond to some of the allegations made for the first
time in the reply brief, trying to spin facts to make my client
look sinister to your Honor.
Here is fact one:  She is a risk of flight because she 
has been hiding out.  Well, let's think about this.  She has 
been litigating civil cases in this courthouse and other parts 
of the country since 2015, denying, as she does here before 
your Honor, that she did anything improper with regards to 
Mr. Epstein.  We submit, your Honor, that is the opposite of 
somebody who is looking to flee.  And in fact, one of the 
people who spoke before your Honor is a plaintiff in one of 
those lawsuits seeking millions of dollars from our client and

seeking millions of dollars from a fund that's being set up.  
Something for the court to consider. 
She has also, as we mentioned, remained in the United
States, even though she has known of the investigation.  How
could she not?  It's been unbelievably public for the past
year.  And we have been in regular contact with her -- with the
government.  Your Honor asked that question, very careful
question from the court, and we got a shimmy from the
government in response.  We have been in contact with them,
conservatively -- as we checked last night, because we thought
you might ask -- conservatively eight to ten times in the past
year, all for the same purpose, to urge them not to bring this
case, which shouldn't have been brought.
The notion that experienced counsel, and counsel at
Haddon Morgan is also experienced, is in regular contact with
the government, would surrender their client, and they turn
around and deny that to the court and deny that voluntary
surrender would and could have and should have been possible
here is, we submit, another factor for the court to consider.
So let me turn to the reply brief.
THE COURT:  Sorry.  If I may, Mr. Cohen, I just want
to make sure I understand that last point.  Are you saying that
defense counsel indicated to the government that, should there
be an indictment returned, you were seeking to arrange a
voluntary surrender?  Is that the contention?

MR. COHEN:  To be precise, we were urging them not to
return an indictment and saying we were always available to
speak.  And, frankly, your Honor, I have been doing this kind
of work for 33 years, everyone knows what that means.
THE COURT:  So you were implying --
(Indiscernible crosstalk) 
THE COURT:  You were implying that, though you were
urging --
MR. COHEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  -- or seeking to forestall the indictment,
should there be an indictment, you were implying that you
should be contacted for voluntary surrender.
MR. COHEN:  Yes, of course.  And the day after our
client was arrested, we got a note from the government sending
the application to detention addressed to us and Haddon Morgan
saying your client, Ms. Maxwell, was arrested yesterday.  So
there was no doubt that we represented her along with Haddon
Morgan.  There was no doubt that we were available and could
have been contacted and worked this out.  There was no doubt
that we are confident we would have.
Let me turn to the reply brief and the effort to throw
some more dirt on my client that we again submit should not be
considered as part of the governing legal standards here and
the precise question before the court.  You heard it today and
in the brief we hear that at the time of her arrest, the agents

breached the gate and they saw her through the window try to
flee to another room in the house, quickly shutting the door,
and that she -- agents were ultimately forced to breach the
door.  So here is the spin.  It's as if the government is just
sort of giving it for the media, here is the spin given to your
Honor to try to influence your Honor's discretion.  What
actually happened?  At least the court has said we can respond
by proffer.  We weren't given a chance to respond in writing.
My client was at the property in the morning in her pajamas.
She was there with one security guard.  Two people in the
house.  The front door was unlocked.  All the other doors of
the house were open.  The windows were open.  Dozens of agents
came storming up the drive, creating a disturbance.  My client
had to hire security because of the threats to her that I have
already relayed before, and the protocol was that in a
disturbance to go into new room.  That's all she did.  Not
running out of the house, not, you know, looking for some
secret tunnel, went in the other room.  The F.B.I. knocked down
the door which, by the way, was open, and my client surrendered
herself for arrest.  That's far from the picture painted by the
government.
Let me turn to another thing that the government
mentioned today in an effort to sort of spin the facts, make
everything look sinister with respect to my client.  The
government said in its opening brief, well, Judge, she is

hiding.  She is a risk of flight because she changed her e-mail
and phone number.  That's what we heard in the opening brief.
Well, what happened?  Something the government, frankly, should
know about, because it was certainly public, last year, in a
civil litigation, in August of 2019, right around the time of
the arrest of Mr. Epstein, the Second Circuit ruled that
certain records in one of the civil cases should be unsealed
and released to the public.  That was done.  There was no stay
at the moment.  The demand was issued, and the documents were
released.  Certain of those documents were supposed to be
redacted and sometimes they were and sometimes they were not,
documents including e-mail addresses, Social Security numbers,
names, phone numbers, the sorts of things your Honor, I am
sure, has to deal with all the time in these kinds of
situations.
But as it turned out, for whatever reason, some of the 
documents were not redacted and her e-mail address was 
revealed.  Shortly after that, she starts getting strange 
e-mails.  Her phone is hacked, and she had to change e-mails 
and change the account.   
Now she has got a phone that has legal materials on 
it, correspondence with her counsel in civil litigation that's 
been hacked, so she keeps it.  Why does she keep it?  Because 
she is in civil litigation.  Her obligation is to keep 
evidence, not destroy it, and is advised that a way to keep it

from being hacked, again, is to put it in the equivalent of a 
Faraday bag, whether it be tinfoil or the bags they now make in 
briefcases, and that's it.  That's all that she does.  And I 
guarantee to your Honor, given the tenor of the government's 
presentation, that had she said, well, this phone was hacked, 
I'm just going to throw it away, the government would be 
standing before your Honor today say, ah-ha, she destroyed 
evidence, that adds to risk of flight.  And she had she put it 
in a safe deposit box, rather than to destroy it, they would be 
saying we cracked into a safe deposit box, your Honor.  This is 
evidence of a risk of flight.  It just does not fit the test, 
we submit. 
And the last point on this, your Honor, which,
frankly, in some ways is the most telling point of all, the
agents do a security sweep, considering this is a house where
there are two people in it -- and I will put that to one side
for a moment -- they talk to the security guard, apparently now
they are going to do the thing multiple times because the
government is dribbling out facts, and they say, well, who
lives in the house?  Ms. Maxwell does.  Okay?  She lives in the
house.  What do you -- how do you get groceries and so forth?
I go out and get them for her.
So let's stop and think about this, your Honor.  The 
government's allegation is that the person who is aware of a 
criminal investigation in the United States, has her counsel in

regular contact with the government, is removed in a property 
in the United States.  That's the opposite of hiding.  So we 
think that those kinds of facts, I'm sure, your Honor, if your 
Honor decides to keep the proceedings open and give us a chance 
to come on some issues, I'm sure we will have some more facts 
tomorrow and the next day, all with the disclaimer, we just 
learned this, your Honor.  They have been investigating this 
case for ten years, your Honor, okay? 
So let me turn now to another factor that the
government made argument about briefly, two more factors under
31(g)(3), the history and characteristics of the defendant.  We
heard several times that there was a -- that detention should
be warranted because there is a perjury charge.  Very quickly,
your Honor, we submit this does not tip the balance in the 3142
analysis that the court has to perform.
First and foremost, the defendant is, of course, 
presumed innocent; and, secondly, the allegation and nature of 
the perjury, if the court has been through the indictment, is 
someone who denies guilt, who says they are innocent, is asked 
in a deposition did you do that and says no, the government 
charges them with perjury.  That is not -- other than the fact 
that it's an indicted charge, they are still entitled to the 
weight the court would give a not indicted charge.  That's all 
the weight it should be given . 
Let me turn to another factor that the government

mentioned in its presentation, both in its papers and today,
that relates to 3142(g)(3), which is the defendant's financial
situation.
Again, when you look at the case law, which is not 
addressed by the government at all, this is a person who has 
passports that can be surrendered, who has travel that can be 
restricted, who has citizenship that the courts have taking 
account of, and does have financial means.  Does she have the 
financial means that the government says she has?  We doubt it.  
But does she have hundreds of millions of dollars like those in 
the Madoff and Dreier case?  No.   
But it doesn't matter.  Even if the court were to 
assume for purposes of today's proceeding that she has the 
means that the government claims she does, it does not affect 
the analysis.  That is to be addressed in conditions, to be 
addressed if the court requires it, through verifications and 
further proceedings before the court.   
And let me just address some of the allegations made 
in the government's brief about her financial situation.  The 
government goes out and arrests our client even though she 
would have voluntarily surrendered, arrests her the day before 
a federal holiday, so she spends extra time in the 
New Hampshire prison before being transported here, and then 
says, how come you don't have a full account of your financial 
condition?  How come, when Pretrial Services asked about it,

you can't, off the top of your head, explain your financial 
condition to them?  You must be lying.  That assertion is 
absurd.   
We have been working since our client was detained, 
with our client, trying to access family members to put, as 
best we could, a financial picture before the court to the 
extent it is relevant to this application and only this 
application.  This bail proceeding should not turn into some 
mini investigation of our client's finances.  The government 
has had ten years to investigate my client. 
Let me address some of the specific allegations in the
government's brief.  They point to a sale of property in 2016.
According to the government, the property was sold for $15
million.  There is no secret about that.  Those records are out
there.  The government claims our client cleared $14 million
from that in 2016 and apparently has it all today, which would
probably make it the first New York real estate transaction to
that effect.  There has been liabilities.  There has been
expenses.  Our client has been through extensive, substantial
litigation all over this country denying these claims.  We
think the number is far less than what the government asserts.
But even taking that number, it's a number far lower than that
in Khashoggi, far lower than that in Dreier, far lower than in
many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,
should be addressed by bail conditions.

            (212) 805-0300

The government also says, well, she has 15 different
bank accounts -- and here we get some hedging language -- that
are by or associated with her.  No detail, no explanation to
the court, just more dirt.  Well, she has three bank accounts
that she disclosed.  She believes that there are more, for
example, with respect to the not-for-profit that she ran for
almost a decade before she was forced to shut it down because
of the issues in the media and the attention and the firestorm.
So it is some number less.  And if it's important to the court,
we will do our best to pull it together.  But under the
relevant cases, it doesn't change the analysis.
And then we go through the last one, your Honor.  They 
say in their brief that she did transfers of funds.  One was a 
transfer of 500,000.  We believe that what that is was a bond 
maturing.  So when a bond matures, it is transferred out.   
And then there was another one, and the government 
sort of changes its mind between its opening brief and its 
reply brief and I'm sure by tomorrow they will have some new 
speculation for your Honor, but essentially let's call it a 
several hundred thousand transfer out of and account in June 
and July of 2019.  What's that refer to?  It refers to one of 
the themes we have been talking about in our submission and 
today your Honor.  When Mr. Epstein was arrested, it had all 
kinds of effects on our client, one of which was that the bank 
in question referenced in the government's submission dropped

her.  Well, when the bank drops you, you have to transfer your 
funds out.  That's true.  That's what happened.  So there is 
nothing in there that's sinister, there is nothing in there 
that shows an intent to evade, an intent to evade, and nothing 
there that we think warrants detention. 
One last point on the financial stuff, your Honor, if
I might.  In the reply brief, we get a new allegation that an
SDAR, a foreign filing was made in 2018 and 2019, disclosing
that our client had a foreign bank account.  Let's stop there.
Our client makes a legally required filing with the Treasury
Department, obeys the law, and discloses a foreign bank
account, and the government is claiming that's evidence of
hiding.  This is all upside-down, your Honor.  These are not
factors to be considered in exercising your discretion under
3142.
Let me turn very quickly to the other two factors that
are relevant for today's purposes because, as your Honor has
pointed out, the government is not proceeding on a
dangerousness claim.  That is the (g)(1) and (g)(2) factors,
the nature and circumstances of the case, and the weight of the
evidence.
Here, I think we -- if you bear with me a moment, your 
Honor, here, one thing to keep in mind is an observation   
Judge Raggi made in the Sabhnani case, at page 77, where she 
said, "The more effectively a court can physically restrain the

defendant, the less important it becomes to identify and 
restrain each and every asset over which defendants may 
exercise some control in order to mitigate risk of flight."  So 
if the court -- and we have suggested them, but they may be 
modified by the court -- can put in place stringent bail 
conditions, we don't need to have a side-long, month-long 
hearing about my client's assets which is just designed to keep 
her in detention.  That was an observation by Judge Raggi in 
Sabhnani. 
Judge, very quickly on the nature and circumstances of
the offense and the weight of the evidence, we don't think,
your Honor, this is the place to litigate legal motions.  This
is a bail hearing.  It is not the place to litigate complex
legal questions that we will be presenting to your Honor.  It's
very soon on the motion schedule, and we thank the court for
agreeing to the schedule.  But there are a few things that are
worth pointing out.
We believe there are very significant motions here 
that will affect whether this indictment survives at all or the 
shape of this indictment and, given the government's 
representation that it is not planning to supersede, will 
affect the shape of the entire case, or any case at all that 
proceeds before the court at trial, if there is a trial.  That 
is exactly what we submit the court can consider, again, in 
exercising its discretion as to the weight of the evidence.

We believe there are significant motions relating to 
the reach of the NPA, which we are not going to litigate here 
before your Honor in a bail proceeding, that are not even 
foreclosed by the cases the government does cite to you.  They 
cite to you the -- I'm going to skip this one, the Annabi case, 
A-N-N-A-B-I case, which says, "The plea agreement binds only 
the office of the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the 
plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction," and that in part 
is going to be our argument.  So we will make it to your Honor 
at the appropriate time.  For today's purposes, it should be in 
the mix in evaluating the weight of the evidence as should the 
points I just made about the perjury charge and we think that 
there are other significant legal challenges to the indictment.   
We also think there are significant issues with the 
weight of the evidence.  The government chose to indict conduct 
that's 25 years old, your Honor.  You will see when you get our 
motions that this, we think, is an effort to dance around the 
NPA, to come into an earlier time period, a related time 
period.  It's all tactics.  That's all this is about.  This 
case is about tactics.  It's an effort to dance around the NPA.  
But the fact of the matter is the government -- 
THE COURT:  Mr. Cohen, I'm sorry, by that do you mean
that the time period charged is not covered by the NPA.
MR. COHEN:  Right.  Exactly.  There is going to be

litigation before your Honor about what is in the NPA, and the
government, we expect, is going to take the position that
unlike '07 is covered and nothing else.  We disagree with that,
which we will lay out for your Honor.  What do they do?  They
decide we will reach back and indict '94 to '97, totally
tactical, your Honor.  So now we have a case where the conduct
is 25 years old, no tapes, no video, none of the sort of things
you would expect in that age of case, that we are going to have
to defend, and we are going to defend.  And I think it goes to
the court's consideration of the weight in the context of the
only application that's before your Honor, which is how to
weigh the 3142 factors with the structure of the statute, with
the guidance of the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court, which
is in favor of bail, in favor of bail on appropriate
conditions.
So we submit that the package we laid out for the 
court is sufficient that we are certainly willing if the court 
deems it necessary to leave the proceeding open and we think we 
could be back before the court within a week if that is what 
the court wants or there is more detail which has been hammered 
by the fact that our client has been, by design, by design, 
kept in custody.  And let me just give your Honor a little 
flavor. 
THE COURT:  Wait, Mr. Cohen.  I missed that last point
could you repeat it, please.

MR. COHEN:  I'm sorry.  If the court desires to leave
the proceeding open for a week and allow us to come back, if
the court has concerns about the number of suretors, for
example, verification information, information about financial
issues, we think that, now that we have some ability to breathe
a little bit, that we should be able to pull this together for
the court's consideration.  We came forward with the best
package we could put together on a limited notice with a client
who was arrested, held in custody, has been since she came to
the MDC held in, I will call it, the equivalent of the layman's
term of solitary confinement.  There is probably a BOP word,
like administrative seg., or some other word they have for it
now.  
We have had a client who has been kept alone in a room 
with the lights on all the time, is not allowed to speak with 
us in the jail at all, wasn't allowed to shower for 72 hours, 
had her legal materials taken away from her, only recently 
given back.  So working with that, we have been trying to 
answer questions about financial situation and others, but it 
is very difficult, your Honor, under circumstances that are of 
the government's creation, of the government's creation, and 
we -- 
THE COURT:  So I do want to understand that point.  I
think that's the "by design" point that you are making.  Just
for clarity, I understand that there was consent to detention

originally without prejudice obviously for precisely the
proceeding we are having, but it sounded like you were
suggesting that her current detention was in some way by design
to prevent you from providing a full picture of her financial
situation.  Is that the implication you are making?
MR. COHEN:  No, I am not saying that, your Honor.  I
am not going that far.  What I am saying is, when you have a
client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the
country despite an investigation, and the government instead
chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early
instances your access to the client.  It is complicated by the
COVID crisis and the other factors your Honor has pointed out
in Stephens and in Williams-Bethea, and so it is very hard for
us to pull together this financial information, and we have
done it as quickly as we could before the court.  But the
notion that my client should have been able to answer off the
top of her head the questions from Pretrial Services about a
real estate transaction, for example, just doesn't make any
sense.  That's the point we are making.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. COHEN:  One last point in that regard, your Honor,
in the schedule we set today -- thank you, your Honor, for
approving that -- the government is saying that it needs at
least until November to complete all discovery, including
electronic discovery.  They have told us that there are two

investigations.  There is the investigation of our client and
there is the investigation of Mr. Epstein.  And they are, in
the government's words, in our words together, voluminous
materials.  We haven't seen any of it yet, but voluminous,
including voluminous electronic materials.  The notion that we
would be able to in any meaningful way review these with our
client to prepare the case for motion and for trial under the
current pandemic situation is just not realistic.  It is not
meaningful.  It is not fair.  And I should say, as your Honor
noted, in the Stephens case, we are not faulting the Bureau of
Prisons.  We are not faulting the Marshal Service.  We
understand they are doing the best they can under the
circumstances.  But this is just not realistic.  We have
conduct that's alleged to be 25 years old.  You have extensive
discovery that's going to take the government, if they hit the
deadlines your Honor set -- and we all know that sometimes it
doesn't happen -- four and a half months to provide, and the
government wants our client to remain in custody that whole
time, without being able to meet with us in person, with
limited access in some form of administrative seg., apparently
because they are afraid of what happened with Mr. Epstein, I
don't know, and it is just not a realistic way to prepare a
case, particularly, your Honor, when, as we submit, the
conditions and combination of conditions to secure her release
can be satisfied here under your Honor's guidance.

And in response to that, the government said, well, 
too bad, COVID crisis, too bad, Ms. Maxwell, we are not going 
to let you out.  We are not going to let you out because you 
might get infected, we are not going to let you out because, 
you know, because it will be tough preparing your trial.  And 
they cite to your Honor, in reply, two pages of cases, very 
limited parentheticals.  If you actually read those cases, they 
are totally different from our situation, your Honor.  The 
cases they cite on health risks in the prison environment, they 
cite 14 cases, 12 of them are dangerousness cases, people who 
are convicted of multiple felonies, including weapons felonies.  
The courts in those cases determined the COVID factors do not 
outweigh that analysis.  They cite nine cases on the 
preparation and access to counsel.  Several of them are 
dangerousness cases, and the other ones that have some 
discussion of flight risk are so extremely different from our 
case as to not be relevant. 
Judge, I don't know how we could possibly prepare this
case, getting four months of discovery, including electronic
discovery, and in over 25 years of conduct, with a client who
is in custody, who we can't meet with in person.  And I'm not
faulting the BOP.  I understand why they have to do what they
have to do, and your Honor has made the same point, but it is
just we have to be in the real world here.  We have to --

risk of flight or dangerousness, they are still entitled to the
same Sixth Amendment rights to access defense counsel to
prepare their case.
MR. COHEN:  Of course, your Honor.  My point was a
more narrow point.  My point is that the facts in those cases
are different from our case in a meaningful way and the court
was doing a different evaluation.  That was the point I was
making on this case.
So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case
for bail.  We believe that the government, which has the burden
of persuasion that never shifts, has not made a showing as
required, that our client is a risk of flight.  When you
consider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the
actual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when
you consider that the only factors they really point to are
ones that the cases have already addressed, such as
international travel and passports.
We also submit that the government has not carried its 
burden of showing there is no condition or combination of 
conditions that secure release.   
So we would ask the court to grant bail today.  And if 
the court needs more information from us, we would respectfully 
request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so 
that we can try to satisfy the court because we want to. 
Thank you, your Honor, for your time.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Ms. Moe, would the government like a brief reply?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you very much.
Your Honor, I want to begin by addressing head on the
notion that the government's presentation in this case is
somehow about spins or about throwing dirt or about the media.
Your Honor, my colleagues and I are appearing today on behalf
of the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District
of New York.  Our presentation of the defendant's conduct is
detailed in an indictment that was returned by a grand jury in
this court.  These are the facts.  It is not dirt.  It is not
spin.  That is the evidence and that is what we have proffered
to the court.
And the notion that anyone could read the indictment
that has been returned in this case and now reach the
conclusion that an adult woman, cultivating the traffic of
underage girls, knowing that they will be sexually abused and
exploited by an adult man, and conclude that that is chilling
conduct, that is, on the face of the indictment, your Honor.
Turning to the facts we have proffered to the court 
about the defendant's finances, and particularly about the 
defendant's conduct in hiding, it appears, your Honor, that it 
is undisputed that the defendant was living in hiding and took 
those actions.  There cannot be any spin or characterization of 
this spin.  Those are the facts that appear to be undisputed.

Turning to several specific points, your Honor, that I
would like to respond to.  I want to address the notion that
the defendant would have surrendered if the government had
asked her to.  As defense counsel conceded, no offer along
those lines was ever made.  And of course the government
doesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation
that their client would surrender.
In fact, the fact that the government took these 
measures to arrest the defendant reflects how seriously the 
government takes the risk of the defendant of flight.  Why on 
earth would the government notify the defendant through her 
counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if the 
government had serious concerns that she was a risk of flight?  
That is exactly what occurred here. 
In addition, it is interesting that defense counsel
notes that it should have been obvious to the government that
the defendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in
civil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined to
accept service on behalf of plaintiffs who were seeking to sue
the defendant in connection with some of these allegations, and
they were required to seek leave of the court to serve the
defendant through their counsel.
Your Honor, turning to the question of the defendant's 
finances there is still at this point no substantive response 
regarding defendant's finances or about the lack of candor to

the court, significantly. 
And while we recognize that it appears that the
defendant's extensive resources may be in complicated banking
records, at a basic level, the defense argument is that she
cannot remember off the top of her head just how many millions
of dollars she has.  That should cause the court serious
concern.
A bail hearing, your Honor, is not an opportunity for
the defendant to slowly reveal information until the court
deems it sufficient.  That is not sufficient process here.
That is not appropriate.  This information is coming out in
dribs and drabs, and defendant should not be in a position to
slowly but surely concede, as the government reveals, that she
has been less than candid with the court about her finances.
There are serious concerns here.
With respect to the notion that the defendant could
just surrender her passports, there are of course no
limitations this court could set on a foreign government
issuing travel documents to defendant or accepting her if she
were to enter into that country.  
And finally, your Honor, with respect to the case law 
that defense has cited, they ignore the obvious comparator 
case, which is Judge Berman's decision regarding Jeffrey 
Epstein, who was arrested both on risk of flight grounds and on 
dangerousness grounds.  And as Judge Berman detailed, the

            (212) 805-0300

detention was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.  
And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time 
had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen. 
I want to respond with respect to the NPA.  At this
point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis
to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution
agreement, and it simply doesn't make sense that the decision
in this case is somehow tactical to avoid concerns about the
NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct
that fell within the scope of the time period within the
nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in
connection with bail proceedings in that matter that this is
the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind
this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or
any kind of individual.  That agreement does not bind this
office whatsoever.
Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to
evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the
circumstances.  The defense's argument, in essence, attempts to
view each of the government's arguments as absolute.  But when
you review the totality of the circumstances -- the defendant's
extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,
her unknown finances and unwillingness to be more candid with
the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail
proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --

            (212) 805-0300

it is clear that defendant has not met her burden to rebut the
presumption of detention in this case.  The government urges
the court to detain this defendant, consistent with the
recommendation of Pretrial Services and the request of the
victims.  It is important, your Honor, that there be a trial in
this case, and the government has serious concerns that the
defendant will flee if afforded the opportunity.
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Briefly, Ms. Moe, just a couple of legal
questions.
Mr. Cohen argued that you failed to address directly 
the standards, the burdens under the statutory provision, and 
that you have avoided the fact of the government continuing to 
carry the burden by a preponderance of the evidence with 
respect to risk of flight and whether there are measures that 
could assure appearance.  Do you dispute anything legally 
suggested by Mr. Cohen in terms of the standard that applies? 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, the government submits that the
standard is clear.  It is the defendant's burden of production
to rebut the presumption that there are no set of conditions
that could reasonably assure her continued appearance in this
case.  The government has the ultimate burden of persuasion,
but it is the defendant's burden of production.  She has failed
to meet that burden for the reasons we set forth in our
briefing and arguments today.

            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
 
THE COURT:  Okay.
And then the other legal question I had, I think 
Mr. Cohen began his presentation by noting -- by raising case 
law suggesting the lack of relevance of the statements of the 
alleged victims, although fully recognizing their entitlement 
under the law to be heard.  What is the government's position 
with respect to the relevance of the alleged victim statements 
in the 3142 analysis? 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, the government has not proffered
victim's testimony or information in an effort to support its
motion.  To the contrary, the victims have appeared consistent
with their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act.  Of
course, as we noted in our reply brief, it is very important to
the government that the victims receive justice in this case
and that there be a trial so that that could happen.  That is
very important to the government, and we respectfully submit
that the court should take that into account.  However, again,
the victims' participation in this proceeding is pursuant to
their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act.  It is not
part of the government's presentation in this case.
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I should not consider it --
should not consider the substance of the statements in the
overall bail analysis.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, with respect to the nature and
circumstances of the offense, the offense conduct, the

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

government submits that the statements of the victims certainly
shed light on the gravity of the offense conduct, the harm it
has caused, and how serious that conduct is.  The court can and
should take that into account.  My point was a procedural one;
that it is not the case that the government is submitting this
as evidence in support of its motion, but it is certainly the
case that the victims' experiences, the harms that they have
been caused can be considered by the court with respect to the
nature and circumstances of the offense conduct, which we
submit is gravely serious.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Mr. Cohen, very briefly, any final points?
MR. COHEN:  Yes, your Honor, very briefly.  I won't
get into it, but I don't think she just answered your question
about what they are doing with respect to the CVRA victims, but
I will leave that to the court.
Just very quickly, two points, your Honor.
The government says in its response now that the case 
to be relied upon and distinguished is U.S. v. Epstein.  They 
didn't raise it in their opening memorandum or their reply or 
in their oral presentation before your Honor.  To the extent 
your Honor considers it, and we have certainly looked at it and 
the transcript of the proceeding before Judge Berman, most of 
that case is about dangerousness, your Honor, which is 
something the government is expressly not proceeding under here

            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
 
because the conduct is 25 years old, among other reasons.   
And as to the risk of flight factors, Mr. Epstein had 
a prior felony conviction for conduct similar to that alleged 
in the indictment.  The package before Judge Berman was only 
two suretors, and any properties that were offered to 
Judge Berman at the proceeding were already subject to 
forfeiture and so could not be proposed.  So it is a very, very 
different situation in that case which was not raised by the 
government, and that's why we didn't address it. 
The last point which I meant to raise earlier, your
Honor, and I will end with this, and I should have raised it
earlier, what we sometimes see in bail cases, and I'm sure your
Honor has seen this, is the government says, well, the
defendant was hiding and we have evidence, your Honor, that the
defendant was making plans to leave the country.  That is the
situation, frankly, in the U.S. v. Zarger case, the case by
Judge Gleeson in 2000, that the government cites in its brief,
but of course doesn't discuss the facts.  There is nothing to
that effect here.  To the contrary, the defendant, our client,
is sitting in New Hampshire at the time of the arrest.  So
there is no evidence that there was some sort of imminence for
the court to consider.
So not to repeat all the arguments we made, we thank
the court for your time and for reading the submissions and
listening, and we just think, Judge, when you step back, the

concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have
not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should
be subject to strict bail conditions to be set by the court,
among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of
fighting this -- preparing and fighting this case to trial.
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, counsel.
I am prepared to make my ruling.
Several provisions of federal law govern the court's
determination whether to detain the defendant or release her on
bail pending trial.  A court must apply that law equally to all
defendants no matter how high profile the case or well off the
defendant.  It is therefore important to begin here with a
clear articulation of the governing law.
It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,
like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of
innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only
grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of
flight or danger to the community.
I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by 
the government at this stage in making this determination, but 
unless this matter is resolved by a plea, it will remain 
entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's 
guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment. 
Turning to the government's standard under Title 18 of

the United States Code, Section 3142, the court may order
detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person
as required and the safety of any other person in the
community.
In making a bail determination the court must consider
the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the
defendant's risk of flight.  A finding of dangerousness, if
that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing
evidence.  A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be
supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
In a case such as this one, where the defendant is
accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal
law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or
combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance
of the person as required.  That's citing 18 U.S.C. 3142(a)(3).
The Second Circuit has explained that, in a
presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a limited
burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the
presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not
pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.
Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production
relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to
be considered among those weighed by the district court.  But

            (212) 805-0300

even in a presumption case, the government retains the ultimate
burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant presents a danger to the community, if that were an
issue, and a showing by the lesser standard of a preponderance
of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.
The statute further mandates that the court take into
account four factors in making its determination: the nature
and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the
evidence against the person, the history and characteristics of
the person, and the nature and circumstances of the danger to
any person or the community that would be posed by the person's
release.  That is 18 U.S.C. 3142(g).
Now that the court has laid out the federal statutory
requirements that guide its bail determination, it turns to the
government's specific application in this case for detention
pending trial.
The government does not argue, as has been repeatedly 
made clear today, for detention based on danger to the 
community.  Instead, it rests its argument for detention on 
Ms. Maxwell's alleged risk of flight.  As noted in a 
flight-risk case, the government bears the burden of proving by 
a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant 
presents an actual risk of flight and that no condition or 
combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant 
that would reasonably assure her presence in court.  And I'm

quoting there from United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, (2d 
Cir. 2019).   
The court concludes as follows:   
First, the nature and circumstances of the offense 
here weigh in favor of detention.  As noted, the crimes 
involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of 
are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor 
of detention.  And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed 
innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of 
these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to 
incentivize her to flee.  In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58 
years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment 
if convicted.  And even if sentences are run concurrently, she 
would still face up to a decade of incarceration.   
Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to 
the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to 
consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the 
government in assessing risk of flight.  The government's 
evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.  
Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the 
indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed 
accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes.  The 
government also proffers that this witness testimony will be 
corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence.  While the defense states that it intends to assert

legal defenses based on untimeliness and the nonprosecution 
agreement, those arguments are asserted in a conclusory fashion 
and have been directly countered by the government with 
citations to law.  Although the court does not prejudge these 
matters at this stage, based on what's been asserted thus far, 
they do not undermine the strength of the government's case at 
the bail determination stage.  Ms. Maxwell is now aware of the 
potential strength of the government's case against her and 
arguments countering these defenses, thus creating a risk of 
flight. 
Third, the court considers the defendant's history and
characteristics and finds that paramount in a conclusion that
Ms. Maxwell poses a risk of flight.  Ms. Maxwell has
substantial international ties and could facilitate living
abroad if she were to flee the United States.  She holds
multiple foreign citizenships, has familial and personal
connections abroad, and owns at least one foreign property of
significant value.  And, in particular, she is a citizen of
France, a nation that does not appear to extradite its
citizens.
Moreover, as the government has detailed in its
written submission and today, Ms. Maxwell possesses
extraordinary financial resources which could provide her the
means to flee the country despite COVID-19-related travel
restriction.  Given the government's evidence, the court

believes that the representations made to Pretrial Services
regarding the defendant's finances likely do not provide a
complete and candid picture of the resources available.
Additionally, while Ms. Maxwell does have some family 
and personal connections to the United States, the absence of 
any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the 
United States leads the court to conclude that flight would not 
pose an insurmountable burden for her, as is often the case in 
assessments of risk of flight. 
In sum, the combination of the seriousness of the
crime, the potential length of the sentence, the strength of
the government's case at this stage, the defendant's foreign
connections, and this defendant's substantial financial
resources all create both the motive and opportunity to flee.
Now, in the face of this evidence, the defendant 
maintains she is not a flight risk.  She notes that even after 
the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and even after the implication by 
authorities and the press that there was an ongoing 
investigation into his alleged coconspirators and that she may 
be implicated, she did not leave the United States.  She hasn't 
traveled, apparently, outside the United States in over a year  
To the contrary, through counsel, she has stayed in 
contact with the government.  The government doesn't contest 
these factual representations.  The fact that Ms. Maxwell did 
not flee previously, given these circumstances, is a

significant argument by the defense and it is a relevant 
consideration, but the court does not give it controlling 
weight here.   
To begin, in spite of the Epstein prosecution, 
Ms. Maxwell herself may have expected to avoid prosecution.  
After all, she was not named in the original indictment.  The 
case was therefore distinguishable from United States v. 
Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988), a case where release was 
ordered in part because the defendant took no steps to flee 
after a search warrant was executed against the defendant and 
he had been arrested on state charges several weeks earlier.   
Likewise, the mere fact that she stayed in contact 
with the government means little if that was an effort to stave 
off indictment and she did not provide the government with her 
whereabouts.  Circumstances of her arrest, as discussed, may 
cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the 
government, a claim that she makes throughout the papers and 
here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may 
face such serious charges herself may not have set in until 
after she was actually indicted.   
Moreover, Ms. Maxwell's argument rests on a 
speculative premise that prior to indictment Ms. Maxwell had as 
clear an understanding as she does now of the serious nature of 
the charges, the potential sentence she may face, and the 
strength of the government's case.  Whatever calculation and

incentive she had before this indictment may very well have 
changed after it.  In other words, her federal indictment may 
well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's 
resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a 
substantial actual risk of flight. 
Having made this determination, the court next turns
to whether the government has met its burden to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions
could reasonably assure the defendant's presence.  The court is
persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes
that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be
insufficient.
As an initial matter, the financial component of 
Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a 
relatively small component of the access available to her and 
is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about 
several million dollars.  But even a substantially larger 
package would be insufficient.  The extent of her financial 
resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank 
accounts discussed in the government's submission and here 
today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full 
accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial 
situation.  She has provided the court with scarce information 
about the financial information of her proposed cosigners, for 
example.  Without a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and

the resources available to her, it is practically impossible to 
set financial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her 
appearance in court. 
Even if the picture of her financial resources were
not opaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.
Personally, the defendant not only has significant financial
resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those
resources and herself.  After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,
Ms. Maxwell retreated from view.  She moved to New England,
changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have
made anonymous transactions both big and small.  The defense
said that she did all of this not to hide from the government
but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press
scrutiny.  Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide
from the press and public, an assumption that the court does
not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent
conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade
detection, even in the face of what the defense has
acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.
Because of these concerns, even a bail package with 
electronic monitoring and home security guards would be 
insufficient.  Were she to flee, the defendant could simply 
remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have 
observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not 
prevent flight.  At best it limits a fleeing defendant's head

start.  Likewise, the possibility that Ms. Maxwell could evade 
security guards or monitoring is a significant one. 
The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that no combination of conditions could reasonably assure her
presence in court.  The risks are simply too great.
Defense cites a number of cases, including Esposito,
Dreier, and Madoff, as examples of serious and high-profile
prosecutions where the courts, over the government's objection,
granted bail to defendants with significant financial
resources.  But unlike those defendants, Ms. Maxwell possesses
significant foreign connections.
This case is distinguishable for other reasons, as 
well.  For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to 
have been based on the resources available to defendant, not 
foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from 
being found.   
In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on 
a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable 
period of time before the government sought detention.  The 
court there found there were no circumstances in the 
intervening period showing that the defendant had become a 
flight risk.  Because of these crucial factual differences, the 
court finds the cases not on point and not persuasive. 
Finally, in arguing for release, the defense raises
the challenges and risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The

court is greatly concern by the Bureau of Prisons' ability to
keep inmates and detainees safe during the health crisis and
has found those considerations to be significant in other
cases.  The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several
reasons.  Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in
which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-19,
Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health
conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk
from the virus.  In other words, she doesn't argue that she is
differently situated than many other federal inmates with
respect to the risk posed by COVID-19.  In light of the
substantial reasons that I have already identified favoring
Ms. Maxwell's detention and her not making any arguments based
on her age or health, the COVID-19 pandemic alone does not
provide grounds for her release.
Second, the defense argues that pretrial release is
necessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, as
COVID-19-related restrictions at the prison at which she is
held, the MDC, will hamper her ability to meet counsel and
review documents.  The court notes that this case is at the
early stages.  There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,
for a significant period of time.  The case does stand in stark
contrast to United States v. Stephens, invoked by the defense,
in which this court at the beginning of the pandemic granted
temporary release to a defendant who was scheduled to have an

evidentiary hearing within one week.  In contrast, the
defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted
defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access
counsel.  Indeed the defense's logic, all pretrial detainees
currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would
need to be released to prepare their defense.  To the contrary,
the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure
attorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants
detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences
with their attorneys.  There is ongoing litigation before 
Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the
adequacy of attorney-client access at the MDC.  That is case
No. 19 Civ. 660.  Public filings from the court-appointed
mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone
calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of
reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their
counsel, and that same report indicates that MDC is currently
developing a plan to resume in-person attorney-client visits in
the near future.
At this stage in this case and at this point in the 
pandemic in New York City, these measures are sufficient to 
ensure Ms. Maxwell has access to her counsel.  To further 
assuage these concerns, the court orders the government in this 
case, and frankly all others before it, to work with the 
defense to provide adequate communication between counsel and

client.  If the defense finds this process inadequate in any 
way, it may make a specific application to this court for 
further relief. 
In sum and for all of the foregoing reasons, the court
finds that the government has met its burden of showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is a risk of
flight and that no combination of conditions could reasonably
assure the presence of the defendant at court.
The defendant is hereby ordered to be detained pending
trial.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Suppmt of her Renewed 
Motion for Release on Bail. 
As set fo1th more fully below, Ms. Maxwell is proposing an expansive set of bail 
conditions that is more than adequate to address any concern regarding risk of flight and 
reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in court. Ms. Maxwell also provides compelling 
additional information in this submission, not available at the time of the initial bail hearing 
(which was held 12 days after her a1Test), that squarely addresses each of the COLut's 
concerns from the initial hearing and fully suppmts her release on the proposed bail 
conditions. This infonnation includes: (1) evidence of Ms. Maxwell's significant family ties in 
the United States; (2) a detailed financial repmt, which has also been reviewed by a fonner IRS 
CID special agent, concerning her financial condition and assets, and those of her spouse, for the 
last five years· (3) inevocable waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United 
Kingdom and France and expert opinions stating that it would be highly unlikely that Ms. 
Maxwell would be able to resist extradition in the implausible event of her fleeing to either 
country- (4) evidence rebutting the Government's contention that Ms. Maxwell attempted to 
evade detection by law enforcement prior to her aiTest and (5) a discussion of the weakness of 
the government's case against Ms. Maxwell, including the lack of c01rnborative, 
contemporai1eous documentaiy evidence in suppmt of the three accusers. 
Ms. Maxwell vehemently maintains her innocence and is committed to defending herself. 
She wants nothing more than to remain in this country to fight the allegations against her, which 
are based on the LU1COIToborated testimony of a handful of witnesses about events that took 
place over 25 yeai·s ago. The Comt should grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the resn·ictive 
conditions proposed below to ensme her constitutional 1ight to prepare her defense.

The Propo ed Bail Conditions 
Ms. Maxwell now proposes the following 28.5 million bail package which is 
exceptional in its scope and puts at risk everything that Ms. Maxwell has- all of her and her 
spouse's assets, her family's livelihood and the financial ecmity of her clo est friends and 
family-if she were to flee, which she has no intention of doing. 
• 
22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by 
s. Maxwell and her 
spouse and seemed by approximately $8 million in property and$ 00 000 in ca h. 
noted in the financial report the $22.5 million figure repre ents the value of all of 
Ms. Maxwell and her spouses assets. The three prope1tie 
ecuring the bond include 
all of the real property that Ms. Maxwell and her spouse own in the United States 
including their primaiy fainil re idence. 
• 
Five additional bonds totaling approximately $5 million co-signed by seven of Ms. 
Maxwell clo est friend and family members. The individual bonds are in amount 
that would cause significant financial hardship to these smetie if Ms. Maxwell were 
to flee. The e include:

New Information for the Court's Consideration 
The defense has devoted substantial time and effmt to compile information that was not 
available to Ms. Maxwell at the time of the initial bail hearing that squarely addresses each of the 
factors the Court considered at that hearing. Because of these effo1ts, Ms. Maxwell can now 
present the following additional infmmation in support of her renewed bail application: 
• 
Letter from Ms. Mal..'Well's spouse. This letter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has 
powerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the 
committed relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her s ouse, who is a U.S citizen, 
and how they lived a quiet family life together 
in the 
United States for over four years immediately prior to her anest. The letter further 
explains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public 
eye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense 
media frenzy and threats following the anest and death of Jeffi:ey Epstein threatened 
the safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, 
For 
these same reasons, Ms. Maxwell's spouse did not come fo1ward as a co-signer at the 
time of the initial hearing. (Ex. A). 
• 
Letters from numerous other friends and family members. These letters from 
Ms. Maxwell's other sureties and several family members and friends attest to Ms. 
Maxwell's strong, forthright character and their confidence that she will not flee. The 
sureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms. 
Maxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B- , W-X). 
• 
Financial report. The financial repmt, prepared by the accounting film Macalvins 
Limited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell's financial condition from 2015-
2020, and discloses (i) all of her own assets, (ii) all assets held in trust, and (iii) all of 
the assets held by her spouse over that same time period. The report reflects that the 
total value of assets in all three categories is approximately $22.5 million, which is 
the amount of the proposed bond. (Ex. 0). 
• 
Report from former IRS agent. 
a fmmer IRS agent with over 40 
years of experience in criminal tax and financial fraud investigations, reviewed the 
Macalvins repmt and confinned that it presents a complete and accurate picture of 
Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets from 2015-2020. (Ex. P). 
• 
Statement from the person in charge of Ms. Maxwell's security. This statement 
rebuts the gove1mnent's claim that she attempted to hide from law enforcement at the 
time of her anest. (Ex. S). 
• 
Extradition waivers and expert affidavits. To address the Comt's concerns about 
extr·adition, Ms. Maxwell will present in-evocable written waivers of her right to

contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France.2 We also pro ide 
opinions from experts in the extradition laws of the France and the United Kingdom 
stating that it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to resist extradition 
from either country in the event she were granted bail and somehow fled to either 
count:Iy which she has no intention of doing. Their opinion also state that any 
extradition proceeding would be re olved promptly. (Exs. T-V). 
• 
Lack of corroborating evidence. The government represented to the Court that it 
had contemporaneous documents ' including diary entries ' in suppmt of its case. 
(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense ha now reviewed the discovery produced to date 
including all of the documents that the go emment described as the core of its case 
against Ms. Maxwell.

meaningful documentaiy c01rnboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of

place over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk the lack of co1Toboration 
only reinforce M . Maxwell's con iction that she ha been falsely accu ed and 
strengthens her long- tanding desire to face the allegations against her and cleai· 
her name in cow1. 
• 
Oppre sive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has now been detained 
for over 150 days in the equi alent of solitaiy confinement since she was 
indicted and auested on July 2 2020 despite the fact that she is not a suicide 
ri k and has not received a ingle disciplinaiy in.fraction. The draconian 
conditions to which Ms. Max ell is subjected are not only unjust and 
punitive but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery 
produced by the go emment and to participate meaningfully in the 
prepai·ation of her defense. Fmthennore the recent OVID-19 outbreak 
at the MD threatens her safety and well-being. 
M . Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Condition 
During her more than five months in. i olation Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has 
been relentlessly attacked in. a deluge of media articles that spiked o er a yeai· ago when Epstein. 
2 Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MD to obtain her 
ignature ince he was quarantined over two weeks ago. She will ign them as oon as legal ,·isits resume.

was a1Tested and has shown no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her a1Test, Ms. 
Maxwell was the subject of over 6,500 national media articles. That exceeds the number of 
a1ticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin 
"El Chapa" Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 90-day period following their anests, 
combined. The media coverage has rnthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has 
exposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences. 
But Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And 
her response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently 
denies them, and she is steadfastly committed to remaining in this country, where she has been 
since Epstein's aiTest in July 2019, to fight them in comt. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would 
have to abandon her spouse 
. She will not risk desn·oying tl1e lives 
and financial well-being of those she holds most deai· to live as a fugitive during a worldwide 
pandemic. In fact, eve1y action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein's a1Test up to 
the time of the first bail heai·ing was designed to protect her spouse 
from 
harassment, economic haim, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wai1ts to stay in ew York and 
have her day in comt so that she can cleai· her name ai1d return to her family. 
Justice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime· it is for the accused as well. 
Here, justice would be se1ved by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions 
we propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are 
unprecedented for a non-violent pren·ial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to 
participate in her defense and prepai·e for n·ial and which jeopardize her physical health ai1d 
psychological wellbeing.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Reconsideration of the Court's Bail Decision is Appropriate Under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(t) 
A prior determination that a defendant should not be released on bail does not preclude 
the Court from reconsidering its decision in light of new information. To the contrary, a bail 
hearing 
may be reopened .. . at any time before tJ:ial if the judicial officer finds that 
infonnation exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing 
and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release 
that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the 
safety of any other person and the c01mnu11ity. 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). 
Comts have relied on§ 3142(f) in revisiting bail detenninations where the defendant 
presents material testimony or documentaiy evidence that was not available to her at the time of 
the i.tlitial heai·i.t1g, even if the underlyi.t1g facts might have been withi.t1 the defendai1t's 
knowledge. For exainple, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (C.D. Cal. 1999), the 
comt granted the defendant's request to reopen llis bail hearing to present evidence of his 
i.tmnediate family's willi.t1gness to act as sureties for Iris release. Id. at 1207. The comt held that 
although "his i.tnmediate family and relatives were obviously known to" the defendant at the time 
of llis anest, his inability to contact them and secure thei.t· appearai1ce at his i.tlitial bail heai·ing 
justified reconsideration. Id. 
Coutts also have found§ 3142(f) satisfied where there is new i.t1formation regai·di.t1g the 
defendant's guilt or innocence or the nature and seriousness of the alleged offense-facts 
generally not known to a crimi.tial defendant at the ti.tne of the i.tlitial heai·i.t1g-paiticularly where 
the evidence m1denni.t1es the government's prior representations to the Comt regai·di.t1g the 
strength of its case. See, e.g., United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)

(Nathan, J.) (reconsidering bail decision based, in pait, on evidence suggesting government's 
case weaker thai1 alleged at initial hearing ai1d concern about possible outbreak of COVID-19 in 
BOP facilities)' United States v. Lee, No. CR-99-1417 JP, 2000 WL 36739632, at *3 (D. .M. 
2000) (reopening hearing to consider, inter alia, affidavits relating to seriousness of the offense 
that defendant "could have not have maitialed" in the 17 days between his indictment and the 
original heai·ing). Chai1ged circumstai1ces also have been found to satisfy§ 3142(f) even when 
the change was within the defendant's control. See United States v. Bradshaw, No. 00-40033-
04-DES, 2000 WL 1371517 (D. Kai1. July 20, 2000) (reopening heai·ing where defendant 
decided to seek substai1ce abuse treatment following initial heai·ing). 
In addition, the Corut may exercise its inherent authority to reconsider its own decision. 
"lAJ release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence protlered on reconsideration 
was known to the movant at the time of the original heai·ing." United States v. Rowe, 
o. 02 CR. 
756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at* 1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003); see also United States v. 
Petrov, 
o. 15-CR-66-LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting 
"CoUit's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Colllt's previous bail decision"). 
Here, Ms. Maxwell has obtained substai1tial information ai1d evidence that was not 
available to her at the time of her initial detention heai·ing. Ms. Maxwell ai1d her coU11sel have 
also received ai1d reviewed the voluminous discovery produced by the government ( over 2. 7 
million pages), which was not available at the initial heai·ing and which raises serious questions 
about the strength of the government's case. As a result, Ms. Maxwell can now present for the 
Cou1t's consideration the additional evidence discussed above in suppmt of her bail application. 
It cannot be reasonably disputed that this new evidence meets the other requirement of 
§ 3142(t): that it have a "material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions ofrelease

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page170 of 200

that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other 
person and the community." The evidence submitted herewith relates directly to factors on 
which the CoUit relied in its initial detention order. Among the bases for the CoUit's initial order 
denying bail were its findings that: 
Ms. Maxwell's lack of"significant tinnily ties" in the United States suggested 
''that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her" (Tr. 84)-
• 
the Cornt lacked "a clear pictme of Ms. Maxwell's finances and the resources 
available to her" that would allow it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87)" 
• "l c Jircrnnstances of her anest . .. may cast some doubt on the claim that she 
was not hiding from the government" (Tr. 85)-
• 
Ms. Maxwell "is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite 
its citizens" (Tr. 83)- and 
the government had protlered that its "witness testimony will be conoborated 
by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence" (Tr. 82). 
The additional evidence submitted herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have 
significant family ties in the United States· that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and 
reasonable bail conditions can be set that Ms. Maxwell has never attempted to hide from the 
government that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would 
be extradited from the United Kingdom or France· and that the government's case against her is 
not suppmted by the c01rnborating documenta1y evidence which the gove1mnent represented at 
the initial hearing. 
The evidence submitted herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have 
reasonably been obtained, assembled, and submitted in the 12 days between Ms. Maxwell's 
anest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether 
reasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shows that the proposed set of conditions will 
reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance in court.

II. 
Ms. Maxwell Should Be Granted Bail Under the Proposed Strict Bail Conditions 
A. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Deep Family Ties to the United States and Numerous 
Sureties to Support Her Bond 
Attached to this submission are letters from Ms. Maxwell's spouse and from 
munerous close family members and friends, many of whom have agreed to serve as smeties 
to support Ms. Maxwell's renewed bail application. (See Exs. A-N, W-X). Far from the 
cruel caricatme that the press has so recklessly depicted since the aiTest of Jeffrey Epstein, 
these letters demonstrate that Ms. Maxwell is generous, loving, and devoted to her family 
and friends, and that her life is finnly rooted in this country with her spouse-
. The signatories of these letters have known Ms. Maxwell for decades, and 
some for her entire life. All know her to be the antithesis of what the government has 
alleged. They trust her completely, including with their minor children. 
These people have stepped forwai·d to support Ms. Maxwell, despite the considerable 
risk that, if their names ever become public, they will be subjected to some of the same 
relentless and harassing media intrusion and personal threats that Ms. Maxwell has 
experienced for years. As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this 
country, the smeties have agreed to sign their own bonds and to post meaningful pledges of 
cash or prope1ty in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms. 
Maxwell were to violate her bail conditions. 
These letters directly address the concern the Comt expressed at the last bail heai·ing 
that Ms. Maxwell did not have "any dependents lorj significant family ties" to the United 
States. (Tr. 84). If Ms. Maxwell were to flee, she would be leaving behind the fainily that 
has been the center of her life 
, she would be abandoning her spouse ■

Ms. Maxwell is De oted to Her pouse -
and Would

The letter submitted by Ms. Maxwell's pouse powerfully demonstrate that M . 
Maxwell ha deep roots in the 
nited tates and is not a flight risk. The letter describes Ms. 
Maxwell's domestic life with her spouse 
in the 
four years prior to her arrest. Her pou e de cribes Ms. Maxwell as a 'wonderful and loving 
person ' who 
the person depicted in the indictment. (Ex.

Indeed it wa because of Ms. Maxwell s devotion to her family and her de ire to 
protect her spouse 
from haras ment and threat that she went 
forward at the fir t bail hearing without relying on her spouse a a co- igner even though 
she knew his support would greatly strengthen her bail application. As her pouse writes:

has agreed to co-sign Ms. Maxwell's $22.5 million bond and to post all three prope1ties he 
owns-all located in the United States and wmth a total of approximately $8 million 
combined as secu1ity for the bond. As the financial repmt discussed later in this 
submission makes clear, $22.5 million represents all of the cuITent assets of Ms. Maxwell 
and her spouse. One of the prope1ties is the family home where Ms. Maxwell, her spouse, 
have lived together 
. If Ms. Maxwell were to violate her bail 
conditions, which she has no intention of doing, she would be leaving her spouse ■ 
-
with virtually nothing. It is unfathomable that Ms. Maxwell would abandon her 
family, which she has fought so hard to protect, under these circumstances. 
2. 
A Nmnber of Ms. Maxwell's Family and Friends, and the Security 
Company Protecting Her, Are Prepared to Sign Significant Bonds 
In addition to her spouse, a number of Ms. Maxwell's family members and friends, 
many of whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have volunteered to step forward as co-
signers. These smeties, as well as the others who have written letters on Ms. Maxwell's 
behalf, know that Ms. Maxwell has never run from a difficult situation and will not do so 
now. To show the depth of their suppmt and their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will abide 
by her bail conditions and remain in this country, the sureties have agreed to sign separate 
bonds for Ms. Maxwell in amounts that aTe significant and meaningful to them, and each 
would cause severe financial hardship if she were to violate her bail conditions. 
For example, one smety, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post the only 
property she owns. This property is wmth approximately $1.5 million and is her "only nest-
egg for retirement." (Ex. C). She writes: 
I do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating 
financially and in every way to my own fa~e house to be taken 
over by the Government due to a breach of-
bail conditions. 
13 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page175 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 20 of 45 
(Id.). Neve1theless, she has "no hesitation" posting her home because she knows "in every 
fibre of l herj being" that Ms. Maxwell ''will never try to flee." (Id.). 
Similarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes: 
This amount re resents the value of effective! all of m assets, including my 
home 
Ifl lost these assets 
because Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be 
financially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I know that 
Ghislaine will remain in the United States to face the charges against her. 
(Ex. F). Two other smeties, one of whom is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds 
in the amount of $25,000, and another will post $2,000 in cash, which are significant 
pledges for these individuals. 
In addition to these bonds, the seCLffity company that will provide secLui.ty services to 
Ms. Maxwell upon her transfer into home confinement has agreed to post a $1 million bond 
in suppmt of her bail application. In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are 
not aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a 
defendant. The head of the seCLffity company has confirmed that they have never done this 
for a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company's "long-
standing relationship with Ms. Maxwell" and because he is "confident that she will not n·y 
to flee." (Ex. S). 
In SLUTI, these bonds reflect the depth of suppmt that Ms. Maxwell has from her 
family and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live 
without constant media harassment to suppmt her. (See Ex. B) ("Absolutely anyone who 
dares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... suppmt Ghislaine personally, gets it 
shot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational 
slaughtering."). Ms. Maxwell would never desn·oy those closest to her by fleeing, after they 
have risked so much to s uppmt her.

B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the 
Past Five Years 
The government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and 
completeness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Se1vices. 
(Dkt. 22 at 11-12; Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Comt stated that it did not have "a clear picture of 
Ms. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her" and therefore had no way "to set 
financial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearnnce in comt." (Tr. 86-87). 
To address the Comt's questions about Ms. Maxwell's finances, defense counsel 
retained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting finn in the United Kingdom, to conduct 
an analysis of Ms. Maxwell's assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins 
accountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial docmnents, including bank statements, 
tax retmns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear pictme of the assets held by 
Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms. 
Maxwell, and the source of those assets from 2015-2020. This analysis, which is based in 
substantial pa1t on docmnents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a 
significant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible 
to pe1fonn this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell's anest and the initial bail 
hearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained following her anest. 
The Macalvins rep01t was also reviewed by 
a Ce1tified Fraud Examiner 
and a fonner IRS Special Agent with over 40 years of experience in complex financial fraud 
investigations. As a Special Agent, -
investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal 
tax cases, including several in this District. -
reviewed the Macalvins rep01t and the 
U11derlying documents and dete1mined that it presents a complete and accurate surmnary of the 
assets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are cuITently, held in

trust for the benefit of Ms. Maxwell, from 2015-2020. The Macalvins repmt and -
's 
repmt are attached as Exhibits O and P. 4 
As set fo1th in the Macalvins repmt, Ms. Maxwell's net wmth at the beginning of 
2015 was approximately $20,200,000. (Ex. 0 ,r 11). The 2015 tax retmn records the sale of 
a residential prope1ty in New York City for $15,075,000. The address of this prope1ty is 
. The proceeds of the sale were deposited at 
(Id. ,r 12). The sale of Ms. 
Maxwell's New York apartment coincided with her intention 
to 
live with her spouse 
(See Ex. A ,r 2). 
Ms. Maxwell manied her spouse in 2016 and commenced filing joint U.S. tax retmns 
from the 2016 tax year until today. (Ex. 0 ,r 13). In 2016 Ms. Maxwell transfened the 
majority of her assets into a trust controlled by her spouse and _
_ (Id.). All assets in 
the trust were distributed to Ms. Maxwell's spouse in 2019. (Id. at 9). Ms. Maxwell and her 
spouse's net wmth as of October 31, 2020 was approximately $22,500 000. (Id. ,r 15). 5 
There has been no alienation of any assets and no significant sum of cash has been 
transfe1Ted outside of the control of Ms. Maxwell or her spouse in the period from 2015-
4 We have not provided the Court with the appendices to the Macalvins rep01t because they are voluminous. If the 
Court would like copies of the appendices, we are happy to provide them. 
:, At her Pretrial Services interview, Ms. Maxwell reported that she believed she had approximately $3.8 million in 
assets, which included her London residence wmth approximately $3 million, and approximately $800,000 in bank 
accounts. Ms. Maxwell was detained at the time and had no access to her financial records and was tlying to piece 
together these numbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, these figures are a close approximation of 
the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her own name at the time of her atTest. (Id. at 9). For the reasons 
already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was relucta11t to discuss anything about her husband and expressed that to Pretrial 
Services.

2020 other than daily li ing expenditures for her famil and for professional services in the 
defense of Ms. Maxwell from the charge she faces. (Id. 16). 
The Macalvins report confirms that Ms. Maxwell disclosed all of her foreign bank 
account in FBAR filings and properly di closed her bank accounts investments and other 
assets in her U .. tax filings at all times. (Id. 
25 30). The report al o explains that the 
transfers of funds between various accounts in the pa t few years which the go ernment 
highlighted in their initial bail submission (Dkt. 22 at 11-12) reflected movement between 
banks triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new 
relationship as well mo ements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial 
inve tment . (Id. ,r 18). 
At the last bail hearing the government sugge ted that Ms. Maxwell' finances were 
' opaque ' and that she potentially had significant [] undetermined and undisclo ed wealth." 
(Tr. 27· Dkt. 22 at 11-12). The Macalvins repo1t lifts this cloud of unjustified intrigue and 
provides a st:raightf01wai·d an wer: Ms. Maxwell and her pou e currently ha e assets worth 
approximately 22.5 million. 6 
ccordingly the proposed bond amount of $22.5 million 
represents all of the couple s current as ets. 
The repo1i ftuiher shows that M . Maxwell ha no undisclo ed wealth and i not 
hiding assets o erseas. To the contra1y for the past se eral years Ms. Maxwell and her 
husband have disclosed their foreign assets by submitting FBAR filings regarding their

foreign bank accounts. Ms. Maxwell is not trying to hide anything from the government. 
She has been entirely transparent with her finances and has filed accmate and timely joint 
tax returns with her spo use for the last four years, and she has put it all at risk of forfeiture if 
she flees under the proposed bail package. The Macalvins repmt and the repmt of-
-
give the COLut a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances. Accordingly, the COLut 
should have no pause about granting her on bail on the proposed terms.

Ms. Maxwell Was Not Hiding from the Government Before Her Arrest

from a 
The letter from Ms. Maxwell's spouse also forcefully debunks the fiction that Ms. 
Maxwell was trying to conceal her whereabouts from the government before her a1Test, as 
the government argued at the first bail hearing. (Tr. 25). Ms. Maxwell made efforts to 
remove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into 
her personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, 
from third parties 
who threatened violence. To suggest that she was a fugitive is patently wrong. 
After Epstein's a1Test and subsequent death in BOP custody, the media coverage of 
Ms. Maxwell spiked dramatically, as the press rushed to substitute Ms. Maxwell for Epstein 
as the target of the scandal. The graph below illustrates the volmne of press articles relating 
to Ms. Maxwell over the course of the last five years. 7 The graph shows that Ms. Maxwell 
was mentioned in news articles only sporadically between October 2015 and June 2019. It 
was not until Mr. Epstein's arTest in July 2019 that Ms. Maxwell was thrown into the media 
spotlight. For exarnple, Ms. Maxwell was mentioned in only 59 articles in total from 
October 2015 to June 2019. Ilrunediately following Epstein's auest, however, she was

named in 97 articles in the month of July 2019 alone. The level of press coverage spiked 
again in November 2019 when the British tabloid The Sun ran an adve1tisement offering a 
£10,000 bounty for infonnation about Ms. Maxwell's whereabouts and it continued at a 
heightened level over the next several months.

This graph depicts in stark visual tenns the sea change in media attention that 
upended Ms. Maxwell's life at the time of Epstein's aITest. But it was not only harassment 
from the press that Ms. Maxwell suddenly encountered at this time. She also faced a deluge 
of threatening messages on social media in the days immediately following Epstein's aITest 
and death. (See Ex. Q). The hatred directed towards Ms. Maxwell in these posts is palpable 
and unsettling. Despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell was not chru·ged- indeed, not even 
mentioned-
in the Epstein indictment, and had not been charged with any crimes, the 
authors refeITed to her as a "crazy, pedophile, pimp, bitch" and a "subhuman c*nt," and 
called for her to "rot in jail." These people also encomaged all manner of violent acts 
19

against 
s. Maxwell. For example one post stated 'they need to get this bitch n string her 
up by her neck ... f"'ckin monster. ' Another stated: 
I hope someone find her and kill her. That would be justice. Ob iously her 
lawyers know's [sic] where she is omeone should stick them up to batteries 
until we find out where she is. 
These posts were paiticularly chilling because some of them suggested that the 
authors 
might-
caiTy out the 
violent acts they had been threatening. For example in re ponse to an Augu t 14 2019 
news rep011 that M . Maxwell might be living in Mas achu ett , one per on wrote:

2. 
Ms. Maxwell's Counsel Was in Regular Contact with the Government 
Prior to Her AlTest 
At no time, however, did Ms. Maxwell intend to flee or hide from the government, as the 
government argued at the last bail hearing. In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her 
spouse's letter makes clear, after spending a few months away 
moved 
so that she could 
, Ms. Maxwell 
be within 
driving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A 
12) (" l Ghislaine J was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against 
her, but to be witllin driving distance of New York."). Contrary to the impression given by the 
government, Ms. Maxwell was not "changing locations on multiple occasions" as if she were a 
fugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in ew Hampshire in 
December 2019, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her 
aITest. (See Ex. B) (" l S Jhe was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving 
around constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name."). 
Ms. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government 
from the moment of Epstein's anest up the time of her own aITest, as would be customary in 
such situations. Defense counsel conesponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-
person meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2019, and also 
in Janua1y and March 2020. The timeline attached to this submission illustrates the extent 
of these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an oppmtunity to be heard in the 
event that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell. 
We were never given that oppmtunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern Distiict of 
New York, nor were we given any notice of her impending ruTest. 
22 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page184 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 29 of 45 
The government argued to the COLut that defense counsel's contact with the 
prosecutors in the months leading up to Ms. Maxwell's aITest prove little about her intent to 
stay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms. 
Maxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the 
intensity of the press attention, her counsel would have provided that infmmation had the 
government asked for it. The government never did. 
3. 
Ms. Maxwell Did Not Tty to Avoid Anest, Nor Was She "Good At" 
Hiding 
Similarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell's 
anest, we would have willingly aITanged for her self-sLUTender. We were never given that 
chance. Instead, the government aITested her in a totally unnecessa1y early morning raid 
with multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year 
am1iversaiy of the anest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell 
was hiding from them. That is simply not the case. 
The government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell's aITest-in pa1ticular, that 
she moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that 
they found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil-evidence an attempt to evade law enforcement. 
(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the COLut, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself 
from the press, not t1ying to avoid aITest. (Tr. 54-57). 
Since the heai·ing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from -
-
the head of the secmity company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her anest, 
which was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). 
statement 
demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding aITest, but was following an agreed-upon 
procedme to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or secLuity. 
23 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page185 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 30 of 45 
According to _
, the secmity guard on duty that day had seen helicopters flying 
over the house, which he assumed to be the press. (Id.). When the guard saw the FBI 
agents walking up the driveway to the house, he again assumed that they were members of 
the press. (Id.) . Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to ale1t her that the press was on the 
grounds and approaching the house. (Id.). In accordance with the procedme that Ms. 
Maxwell's secmity personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away 
from the windows and into a safe room inside the house. (Id.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying 
to avoid aiTest" she was simply following the established security protocols to protect herself 
from what had been infonned was an ambush by the press. 
Regarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Comt at the initial 
bail heai·ing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone 
after the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed ce1tain comt records with the phone munber 
Lmredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having now reviewed the discovery produced by the government, 
it is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the "master spy" the government makes her out to 
be and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement. 
First, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of "Ten-ainai· Project, 
Inc.," which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell's charity. 
Second, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2020, just before her 
anest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities 
were using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of 
"G Max" that she was using as her primaiy phone, which was not covered. It would make 
no sense for her to t1y to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other. 
24 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page186 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 31 of 45 
Indeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms. 
Maxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her prima1y phone. 
In sum, the cellphone clearly shows that Ms. Maxwell was not "good at" hiding or 
that she was avoiding aiTest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 31-32). She was trying to 
protect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not captme by law 
enforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bai· to granting bail. The proposed conditions 
enslffe her presence at home in plain sight of-
(and the security guards), GPS-
monitored, and under su·ict Preu·ial supervision. 
D. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek 
Refuge in the United Kingdom or France 
At the initial heai·ing, the government ai·gued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen 
who has lived in the United States for almost 30 yeai·s, might tlee to the United Kingdom or 
France if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the counu·y for neai·ly a yeai· after 
Epstein's aiTest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) TI1e government asserted in its reply brief that Frai1ce "does not 
exu·adite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law." (Id.) At the bail heai·ing, the 
government represented that "France will not exu-adite a French citizen to the United States as a 
matter of law, even if the defendai1t is a dual citizen of the United States," and that exu·adition by 
the United Kingdom would be "lengthy" and "unce1tain" with bail "ve1y likely" pending the 
exu·adition proceeding. (Tr. 27 .) These asse1tions are inconect, paiticulai·ly given Ms. 
Maxwell's inevocable waiver of her exu·adition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom 
and France. 
As we noted for the Comt at the initial heai·ing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would 
attempt to flee the United States is entirely unfom1ded given that Ms. Maxwell had eve1y motive 
and oppmtunity to flee after the anest ai1d death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this 
25

country. (Dkt. 18 at 12-14, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche 
of media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is now one of the most recognizable and infamous 
people in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be 
camped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell 
could somehow tlee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane), 
while being supe1vised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps 
on her every minute, without being caught, is absurd. 
To the extent the Comt is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her anest 
because the threat of prosecution has now crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms. 
Maxwell has addressed that concern head-on-she will execute iffevocable waivers of her right 
to contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers 
demonstrate Ms. Maxwell's firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges 
against her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the attached expe1t rep01ts, because of these 
waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully 
resist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely 
event she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition 
proceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (Id.). 
Comts have addressed concerns about a defendant's ties to a foreign state that enforces 
extradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of 
release-including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U.S . citizens. 
See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, o. 99-1514, 1999 WL 1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999) 
(vacating di.strict comt's detention order and reinstating magistrate's release order, which 
required foreign citizen and resident to sign an "iffevocable waiver of extradition" as a condition

ofrelease)" United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 ( .D .. Y. 2004) (ordering each 
of two defendants to "execute and file with the Clerk of the Cornt a waiver of extradition 
applicable to any nation or foreign territory in which he may be found as a condition of his 
continued release'')" United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132-33 (D.D.C. 2004) 
(requiring Israeli citizen who lived in South Africa and had "no ties to the United States" to sign 
waiver of rights not to be extradited under Israeli and South African extradition treaties with 
United States)" United States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 ( .D. Cal. 1992) (ordering as a 
condition of release that defendants "execute waivers of challenges to extradition from any 
nation where they may be found"). Moreover, a defendant's waiver of the right to appeal an 
extradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant's intent not to flee. See, 
e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (Judge Keenan found 
defendant's extradition appeal waiver "manifests an intention to remain here and face the 
charges against him"). 
In response to the government's assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying 
repmts of expe1ts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the 
likelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France, 
would be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right 
to do so. Both have concluded that it is highly rn1likely that she would be able to resist 
extradition successfully. 
United Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, submitted herewith is a repmt 
from David Peny ("Peny Rep."), a U.K. banister who is widely considered one of the United 
Kingdom's preeminent extradition practitioners. (Peny Rep. Annex B 2.1) (attached as Exhibit 
U). Mr. Peny has acted on behalf of many overseas governments in extradition proceedings· has

appeared in the High Cou1t, House of Lords and Supreme Couit in leading extradition cases· and 
has acted as an expe1t consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on international cooperation. 
(Id.). In 2011 and 2012, Mr. PeITy was pa1t of a select team appointed by the U K. government 
to conduct a review of the United Kingdom's extradition anangements, a review that fonned the 
basis of changes to the 2003 Extradition Act. (Id. Annex B 3 .1 ). 
In Mr. Peny's opinion, it is "highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
successfully to resist extradition to the United States" in connection with this case. (Peny Rep. 
2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human 
rights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell's extradition, Mr. PeITy explains that Ms. 
Maxwell's waiver of her extradition rights "would be admissible in any extradition proceedings 
and, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the 
extradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete." (Id. 
24-39). 
Mr. PeITy's repmt also undercuts the government's representation at the initial hearing regarding 
likelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that "a person who absconded from laJ US criminal 
proceeding in breach of bail .. . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail" in a subsequent UK. 
extradition proceeding. (Peny Rep. 23). 
France. The accompanying repmt of William Julie ("Julie Rep.") reviews the French 
extradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expe1t on 
French extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European 
Union and regularly appears as an extradition expe1t in French comts. (Julie Rep.) (attached as 
Exhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government's representation, "the extradition 
of a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law." (Id. at 1). 
28 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page190 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 35 of 45 
Mr. Julie opines that the French entity with jurisdiction over the legality of extradition 
requests would not oppose Ms. Maxwell's extradition on the ground that she is a French citizen, 
and that it is "highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an 
extradition decree" against her. (Id. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms. 
Maxwell's U.S. citizenship· (ii) her inevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to 
the United States; (iii) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France 
in violation of strict bail conditions in the United States· (iv) the fact that a failure to extrndite 
would obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French comts for the same 25-year-old 
conduct alleged in the indictinent, which did not take place in France· and (v) France's 
diplomatic interest in accommodating an extr·adition request from the United States. (Id.). Mr. 
Julie adds that the extr·adition process would likely be "disposed of expediently"· where the 
requesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extr·adition request, "the extr·adition decree is 
generally issued in only a few weeks." (Id. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition 
proceedings are pending, "the French judicial authorities would most ce1tainly decide that lMs. 
Maxwellj has to remain in custody given her tlight from the USA and the violation of her bail 
tenns and conditions in this requesting State." (Id. at 12). 
Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her rights to 
contest extr·adition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the 
allegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee 
after being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extr·adited 
expeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no 
weight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countr·ies. 8 
~ Ms. Maxwell would also have very little incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French 
authorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell. See

E. 
The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of 
the Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell 
At the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Comt that "the evidence 
in this case is strong" and that the allegations of the alleged victims were "backed up l by J 
contemporaneous documents ... lincludingJ flight records, diaiy entries, business records, 
and other evidence." (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Comt credited those representations ai1d accepted 
the government's proffer that the witness testimony would be "c01Toborated by significant 
contemporaneous documenta1y evidence." (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of 
comse, could not rebut the government's representations at the heai·ing because the 
government had not yet produced discove1y. 
Since then the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of 
thousands of pages of discove1y, including the entire initial tranche of discove1y that the 
government represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell. 
9 The discove1y 
contains no meaningful documentary c01Toboration of the allegations whatsoever much less 
"significant" c01Toboration that the Comt was led to believe existed. The vast majority of 
the discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2000s ai1d the 
2010s, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (1994-1997). These documents 
include 
In fact, only 
Daily Mail, "French prosecutors probing Jeffrey Epstein over rape and abuse of children in Paris widen probe to 
include Ghislaine Maxwell to see if British socialite was involved in his offending," (Oct. 25, 2020), 
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/ruticle-8878825/French-prosecutors-probing-Jeffrey-Epstein-widen-probe-
include-Ghislaine-Maxwell html. 
9 The defense has not yet completed its review of the over 1.2 million documents produced on 
ovember 9, 2020 
ru1d 
ovember 18, 2020. This production includes documents ru1d images seized from electronic devices found at 
Epstein's residences in searches of his residences in 2019. Our initial review, however, shows that the documents 
ru·e from the 2000s ru1d 201 Os, well after the chru·ged conspiracy.

a very small fraction of the discovery pe1tains in any way to the individuals we believe to be 
the three complainants named in the indictment, and none of it conoborates any allegations 
of"grooming" or sexual assault or a conspiracy with Epstein involving Ms. Maxwell. 
For example, the government represented to the Comt that it had "diaiy entries" that 
conoborated the witness testimony, suggesting that more than one of the complainants had 
kept contemporaneous diai·ies that implicated Ms. Maxwell. (Dkt. 4 at 5). The discove1y 
produced thus far contains only 
In addition, the flight records that the government touted at the bail heaiing, which 
include

The disco ery also does not contain any police rep01ts in which the people we 
belie e to be the complainants reported the alleged crimes to law enforcement. To the 
contra1y the only police reports provided are exculpatory. 
In sum, the di co ery contains not a single contemporaneous email text mes age 
phone record, diary ent:J.y police rep01t or recording that implicates Ms. Maxwell in the 
1994-1997 conduct underlying the conspiracy charged in the indictment. The few 
documents in the discove1y that pertain to the people we belie e to be the three 
complainants referenced in the indictment do little if anything to support the go emment' s 
case against Ms. Maxwell:

• 
In addition, the discove1y appears to show that 
-
the go ernment did not is ue subpoenas for documen related to Ms. Maxwell until 
after Epstein s death. Although the discove1y does not include the grand jm subpoenas 
them elve the subpoena returns appear to indicate that the government began i suing 
subpoenas for M . Maxwell' financial information on ugu t 16 2019 six days after 
Epstein s death, and is ued additional ubpoenas in the months that followed. The facts 
strongly imply that government only chose to pmsue a case against Ms. Maxwell-who wa 
not named in the Epstein indictment-because the main ta1·get Jeffrey Epstein had died in 
their cu tody. The lack of con-oboration in the disco e1y confmns that the ca e against Ms. 
Maxwell wa an afterthought and was re erse engineered ba ed on allegations of 25-year-
old conduct from a small number of alleged victims. 
Thus notwithstanding the statement in the go ernment' bail ubmission we have 
been provided with no meaningful documentary conoboration in this case. It appear that 
the evidence in this ca e boil down to witness testimony about events that allegedly took 
place o er 2 year ago. Far from creating a flight risk the lack of con-oboration only 
reinforces Ms. Maxwell's convi tion that she has been falsely accused and t:rengthens her 
long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and cleru· her nrune in court. This 
factor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms. 
axwell bail.

F. 
The Proposed Bail Package Is Expansive and Far Exceeds What Is 
Necessary to Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell's Presence in Court 
In light of the additional infonnation that Ms. Maxwell has provided in connection 
with this submission, which responds to each of the concerns raised by the government at 
the initial bail hearing, the government cannot meet its bmden to establish that no set of bail 
conditions would reasonably assme Ms. Maxwell's appearance in comt. The proposed bail 
package is exceptional in its scope, addresses all of the factors that the Comt considered in 
evaluating risk of flight, and is more than sufficient to wanant her release from BOP 
custody and transfer to restricted home detention. 
CoUits in this Circuit have ordered release of high-profile defendants with financial 
means and foreign citizenship on bonds in lower amounts with less or no security with similar or 
less restrictive conditions:

The Comt should also not give any weight to the gove1mnent's speculative assertions that 
others might provide money and other support to Ms. Maxwell if she were to flee. (Dkt. 22 at 
34 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page196 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 41 of 45 
11-12). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government 
might raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not 
the standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The 
legal standard required by the lBail Refmmj Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute 
guarantees."). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail 
conditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to 
protect since Epstein's arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail. 
G. 
The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions 
that Impact Ms. Maxwell's Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense 
Granting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past 
few months have shown that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately pa1ticipate in her defense and 
prepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued 
confinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but 
also meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell's ability to review the voluminous discove1y produced by 
the government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense. 
Ms. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention now over five months 
in de facto 
solitaiy confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence AD MAX to 
supervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and ai·e tantamount to imprisonment 
as a defendant convicted of capital murder ai1d incarcerated on death row. In fact, multiple 
wai·dens ai1d interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they 
have never seen anything like her cmTent regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms. 
Maxwell is subjected ai·e not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms. 
Maxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions ai·e an 
35 

Case 21-770, Document 20-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page197 of 200

exaggerated response to Epstein's death, etlectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP's own 
negligence with respect to Epstein. 11 
Counsel has attempted to address the restrictions in numerous letters, emails and calls to 
the MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than 
repeating these points here at length, we refer the Comt to our letter to the MDC warden, dated 
October 29, 2020, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of 
confinement. 12 TI1ese include: 
• 
De Facto Solitary Confinement 
• 
Excessive Surveillance 
• 
Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching 
• 
Deprivation of Food 
• 
Deprivation of Sleep 
• 
Deprivation of Co1mnunication with Family and Friends 
• 
Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel 
The conditions of Ms. Maxwell's detention are utterly inappropriate, and totally dispropmtionate 
for a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal histmy facing non-violent charges a 
quarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepai·e her defense ai1d 
compromise her physical health ai1d psychological wellbeing. 
In addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with 
numerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discove1y that the government 
has produced to her thus fai·. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous 
occasions. As we advised the Court in our letter of October 23, 2020, defense counsel first 
11 These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not 
received any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is 
the highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is 
being constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever 
released from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide. 
12 The Warden never responded to the letter. In our response to the government's 90--day status report concerning 
MDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Colllt and coll11Sel. Following 
Court directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submitted a letter that recited BOP policy but failed to 
address a number of concerns.

ale1ted the gove1mnent on August 27, 2020 that there were significant pmtions of the first three 
discove1y productions that Ms. Maxwell could not read. (Dkt. 66). Despite numerous attempts 
to fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive 
containing these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was 
broken. In addition, the fomth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense 
ale1ted the govenunent to these problems, contained some of the same teclmical problems and 
included a significant number of m1readable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the 
sixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has 
not had access to a complete set ofreadable discovery for over four months.13 Ms. Maxwell 
caimot defend herself if she caimot review the discovery. 
Most recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quai·a11tine. On 
ovember 18, 2020, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in 14-day quai·antine due 
to contact with a statler who tested positive. TI1e revolving teain of guards assigned to Ms. 
Maxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their own COVID outbreaks, 
heightens her exposure to the virus. As repmted by the associate wai·den to the Criminal Justice 
Advismy Board on December 2, MDC does not mai1date testing ainong its staff A temperature 
check and response to a few questions does little to detect an asymptomic caiTier. TI1e constant 
strip seai·ching, touch wai1ding, ai1d in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for 
exposure to COVID-19. 
13 On ovember 18, 2020, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC, 
which it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive 
containing all of the discovery. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the 
technical problems. We note, however that now that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has 
access to the laptop from 8am-5pm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot 
because of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer. 
37

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 44 of 45 
Ms. Maxwell's quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal 
visits. TI1is is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the 
MDC. Within a two-day period from December 1 to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive, 
compared with 25 from March to December 1. As of the date of this filing, the BOP repo1ts 80 
MDC inmates and staff with COVID.
14 Iflegal visits are suspended, it will fmther limit our 
ability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms. 
Maxwell and will fmther compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court 
obse1ved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs "substantial medical and secmity 
challenges would ahnost certainly arise." Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Cou1t to 
weigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens. 
CONCLUSION 
Ghislaine Max well is committed to defending herself and wants nothing more than to 
remain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the 
allegations against her and clear her name. She is detennined to ensure that her sureties and her 
family do not suffer because of any breach of the tenns of her bond. We have presented a 
substantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Couit and the government, which 
contains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell 
remains in ew York and appears in cou1t. TI1e Cou1t has the obligation to ensure that a 
defendant's constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. TI1e c01Tect-and only 
legitimate-decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.
