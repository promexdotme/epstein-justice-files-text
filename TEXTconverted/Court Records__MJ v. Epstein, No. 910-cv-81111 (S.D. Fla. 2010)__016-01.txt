It was all 
testimony presented to the grand jury.

Let me see the Indictment

I have one Indictment, one

MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
So one case is charged by 
Indictment, one is ch~rged by Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct.

The defendant has no

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, Your Honor.

You checked the NCIC as 
well as State records? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
And the guideline score 
sheet I have before me shows 21.5 months in 
the Department of Corrections as the lowest 
permissible prison sentence in months.

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We so agree, Your 
Honor.

Yes.

client to community control, sex offender 
status. 
THE COURT: 
I understand. 
Okay. 
What is proposed -- those 
are the maximums and minimums, Mr. Epstein. 
What is proposed is that you will be 
pleading guilty to felony solicitation to 
prostitution and procuring a person under 
18 for prosecution. 
A PSI would be waived, 
you would be adjudicated guilty of both 
felonies, is that correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
And on 06 9454, the 
defendant to be sentenced to 12-months in 
the Palm Beach County 
detention 
facility? 
He's going to do time in the 
jail? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
With credit for one day 
served. 
And on 08 9381, he is to be 
sentenced to six months in the Palm Beach 
County jail detention facility, with credit 
for one day served. 
And the six month 
sentence is to be served consecutive to the 
12 month sentence?

Following the six months 
sentence, the defendant will be placed on

The 
conditions of the community control are 
attached hereto and incorporated herein. 
As a special condition of 
community control, he's to have no 
unsupervised contact with minors and the 
supervising adult must be approved -- and I 
would say, pre-approved, approved ahead of 
time, not after the fact by the Department 
of Corrections. 
And you would mean by that 
his community control officer? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
The defendant is 
designated as a sexual offender pursuant to 
Florida Statute 943.0435 and must abide by 
all the corresponding requirements of the 
statute, a copy of which is attached hereto 
and incorporated herein. 
The defendant 
must provide a DNA sample in court at the 
time of this plea. 
Is this the --
and the 
attachments are the terms and conditions of 
community control.

Actually Your Honor, 
the agreement of the parties is to, it's 
community control one which is not monitor.

Oh, community control 
one, is that spelled out in here?

I can go through

These are the 
standard conditions of community control by 
statute would apply to anyone that goes on 
community control and out of an abundance 
of caution, we simply memorialized those 
standard conditions in the plea sheet 
agreement.

specified contact with the parole and

PROBATION OFFICER: 
Specified by you, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
I don't see that in the 
plea sheet. 
That's why I'm asking the 
questions. 
No one has specified how often, 
how frequently he is to have contact with 
his parole and probation officer. 
Confinement to an agreed upon residence 
during the hours away from employment and 
public service activity, has that been 
articulated? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I believe 
Judge Mcsorley has a standard order 
somewhere on the bench up there regarding 
this, I'm told by the prosecutor. 
MS. LENHARDT: 
Judge, usually this is 
the probation sheet she hands out to folks. 
THE COURT: 
I have seen those 
sheets --
I have seen them incorporated in 
plea agreements which is why I'm asking. 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
I see. 
THE COURT: 
Is there some reason you 
didn't use this particular document in this 
case?

If you wish to change

somebody on community control.

agree to some change, let me know, but 
understand at the outset that I'm a big fan 
of specificity.

will be doing for employment.

out the Palm Beach County to have any doubt 
or confusion as to exactly what this 
defendant is supposed to do, where he is 
supposed to be when, exactly what I am 
requesting that officer to supervise.

Absolutely.

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, we are 
back on Jeffrey Epstein, actually it 
worked, we had an opportunity to go through 
Judge McSorley's conditions of community 
control and we asked the Department of 
Corrections representative to assist us to 
make sure we did everything properly. 
They were very helpful and we executed the 
document. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes, and Your Honor, 
this defendant doesn't fall under the sex 
offender probation but we have included 
special sex offender conditions as part of 
the community control and they are all 
circled there. 
THE COURT: 
The plea agreement stated 
the defendant is designated as a sexual 
offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
942.035. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
But the 
sex offender probation, the statute is 
different and only applies to certain 
offenses and this one was not enumerated. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
I want to make

Correct.

And we will talk about 
that.

But it is not the one

that requires the special conditions of sex 
offender probation?

you want me to disregard 948?

in a second as a part of the whole plea.

accounting of all your activities on a

log, maybe I'm just confused from other 
cases I've heard, is the daily log is a 
weekly log, I guess it is submitted ahead 
of time, is that correct?

PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor . 
THE COURT: 
As will his supervising 
probation officer. 
And then to document 
that he's supposedly done all that he 
himself will be keeping a daily log? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
And the log form will be 
provided by the department and he will be 
turning that in every time he meets with 
the probation officer? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
So that applies 
and F applies. 
Does E apply? 
No. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Did I circle E?

No.

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
He does, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Is there any possibility 
that he no longer owns the residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Not anticipated, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
for whatever reason 
Should he not be 
18-months is a long 
time, should he not be owning that 
residence or able to reside there, he will 
have the obligation of notifying his 
probation officer prior, and I emphasize 
this, prior to his release from custody. 
I 
assume that the department will be notified 
prior to, to his release? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
And then you would need 
to send someone to meet with him before he 
walks out of the Palm Beach County jail and 
verify his address and employment

All address --
I assume 
all of this to and from work and any other 
approved activities restricts him to Palm 
Beach County, is that correct? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
So let's be clear, 
everything, from the day he walks out 
18 
occurs in Palm Beach County, is that clear? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We understand, Your 
Honor. 
That's correct. 
THE COURT: 
Then the additional 
condition of his probation, they are not 
sex offender standard conditions, they are 
just conditions that are being imposed 
especially in this case? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
They are as follows, you 
shall submit to a mandatory curfew from 10 
p.m. to 6:00 a.m. regardless of any other 
restrictions regarding work or approved 
activity, there will be no exceptions to 
being at home in house from 10 p.m. to 6

because it's circled, you shall not live 
within 1000 feet of a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
where children regularly congregate. 
Has someone verified that 358 El 
Brillo is such a place? 
19 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
No, but that will be 
done prior to his release. 
THE COURT: 
So 358 El Brillo will not 
be approved if it should happen to be one 
thousand feet from a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
this is rather open.

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We have done our due 
diligence, for what it•s worth, there is a 
residential street. 
There are not children 
congregating on that street. 
We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Dis, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There's several. 
THE COURT: 
several, all of the 
victims. 
So this should be plural. 
I'm 
making that plural. 
You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this 
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. 
By 
indirect, we mean no text messages, no 
e-mail, no Face Book, no My Space, no 
telephone calls, no voice mails, no

a friend, acquaintance or stranger approach 
any of these victims with a message of any 
sort from you, is that clear? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am 
THE COURT: 
And then it states, 
unless approved by the victim, the 
therapist and the sentencing court. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
I understand. 
Okay. 
THE COURT: 
And the sentencing court. 
So, if there is a desire which, I would 
think would baa bit strange to have 
contact with any of the victims the court 
must approve it. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
If the victim was under 
the age of 18, which was the case, you 
shall not until you have successfully 
attended and completed the sex offender 
program. 
So, is this sex offender program 
becoming a condition of probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
That is not. 
I 
don't believe I circled that one.
