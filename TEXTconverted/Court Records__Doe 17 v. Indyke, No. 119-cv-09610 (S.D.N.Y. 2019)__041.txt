File No.:

Dear Judge Freeman: 
 
 
We write to you pursuant to Local Civil Rule 1.4. This firm was retained as local counsel 
for Jane Doe 17 in the above-referenced matter. We recently received correspondence from the 
client indicating her desire to discharge us as her counsel. She will continue to be represented by 
the other attorneys who have appeared on her behalf, namely David H. Brodie and Laura Starr of 
Weisman, Brodie, Starr & Margolies, P.A., and Alan Goldfarb and David Appleby of Alan 
Goldfarb, P.A. The case is presently stayed per Hon. Paul A. Engelmayer’s order of January 9, 
2020, which permitted the stay pending potential participation in the Epstein Victims’ 
Compensation Program. 
 
 
Based on the above, we respectfully request that Your Honor enter an order, pursuant to 
Local Civil Rule 1.4, relieving myself and Buzin Law, P.C. of representation of Jane Doe 17. We 
waive and otherwise renounce any right to a retaining or charging lien. 
 
 
This letter motion is being served upon Jane Doe 17 through counsel and upon all other 
parties.
