PROBATE NO. ST-19-PB-80 
ACTION FOR TESTATE 
ADMINISTRATION 
CO-EXECUTORS' CORRECTIONS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 
STATUS REPORT ON VOLUNTARY COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
AND RENEWED REQUEST FOR RULING 
On March 24, 2020, the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"), 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, asked the Court to grant their Expedited 
Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, filed November 14, 2019, 
and allow the Co-Executors to move forward with that Program as carefully constructed in 
consultation with claimants' counsel and leading independent claims program experts. 
The Co-Executors hereby renew their request. Because the Attorney General of the Virgin 
Islands has no standing in this Court to seek to re-shape the Program to suit her whims -
demanding changes that go against the considered views of the Co-Executors, recommendations 
of nationally recognized experts in the field, and endorsement by multiple claimants' counsel -
the Court should reject her continued efforts to undermine the Program. As detailed below, the 
Attorney General's most recent Status Report (filed April 7, 2020) substantially misrepresents the 
actual state of affairs regarding the Program, and requires correction. 
1. 
The Attorney General Misrepresents Claimants' Position Regarding 
the Program's Third-Party Release 
The Attorney General informs the Court that she and claimants' counsel are aligned on 
rejecting the third-party release (the "Release") that those claimants who elect to receive 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 2 of 17

compensation under the Program would execute. (See 4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 2-3.)1 That 
is false. On the very day that the Attorney General made that (mis)representation to the Court, the 
two most active claimants' counsel -
together, representing by far the largest number of claimants 
-
informed the Co-Executors and the Attorney General that they are prepared to proceed with 
the Program without change to the existing Release. 
The evidence on this point is undisputed. On the morning of April 7, 2020, David Boies 
of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP ( counsel for at least five prospective claimants) informed the Co-
Executors that the existing Release was acceptable as written: 
"I spoke with [counsel for the Co-Executors] this morning. I am now in 
agreement that we should move forward with the claims process without trying 
to further modify the [R]elease. 
I am influenced by the desirability of getting the [P]rogram underway so 
that our clients can begin getting compensation; by the fact that the [R]elease will 
be limited to persons who provided services to Epstein, with the [Re ]lease signed 
by individual victims who accept an award having a space to make clear that certain 
individuals . . . are not released, and by the fact that the release of Epstein's 
employees/service providers will be taken into account by the [Program] 
Administrator in setting the amount of the award. And, of course, this is a 
voluntary process where our clients get to decide whether to be bound after 
learning the amount of the proposed award." 
(See email from David Boies dated April 7, 2020 to Bradley Edwards and counsel for the Co-
Executors, copy attached here as Exhibit B; emphasis supplied.) 
Claimants' counsels' intent to proceed with the Program including the Release as written 
was known to the Attorney General before she informed the Court otherwise. On April 6, 2020 
-
the day before the Attorney General filed her most recent Status Report -
lead counsel for 
some two dozen other prospective claimants told her exactly that. Writing to Mr. Boies, Bradley 
1. A copy of the Release, provided on March 16, 2020 by the Co-Executors to the Attorney General and 
claimants' counsel, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Page 3 
Edwards explained his agreement to accept the Release as written, and noted that he had the day 
before told the Attorney General of that fact: 
"We are now both on the same page. I would like, with your permission to 
forward that email [i.e., Mr. Boies' email quoted infra, approving the Release as 
written] to the AG, as I voiced a very similar position to her yesterday." 
(See email from Bradley Edwards dated April 7, 2020 to David Boies and counsel for the Co-
Executors; copy attached as Exhibit C).2 
It is one thing for the Attorney General, who has no experience or expertise with mass tort 
compensation programs, to inveigh against the Program. It is quite another for her to misrepresent 
to the Court that claimants' counsel join in her criticism of the Release. They do not. 
2. 
The Attorney General Misrepresents the Scope of the Release, 
Which is Designed to Prevent "Double Dipping" by Claimants 
The Attorney General also misrepresents the scope of the Release, asserting that the Estate 
seeks the release of "any party" who themselves participated in wrongdoing, including 
"individuals for whom the Estate has no liability." (See 4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 3.) Again, 
that is false. 
The Release is closely modeled on releases employed in multiple voluntary compensation 
programs administered by the Program Administrator and Designers, including the sexual abuse 
scandals currently faced by the Catholic Church. Contrary to the Attorney General's claim, it does 
not include "any party" who committed wrongdoing, nor have the Co-Executors ever proposed 
2. Both Mr. Boies and the Co-Executors immediately consented to Mr. Edwards' request to share 
Mr. Boies' email with the Attorney General, who thus had both Mr. Boies' and Mr. Edwards' 
statements accepting the Release as written before she filed her misleading Status Report with the 
Court.

that it would.3 Rather, as the Co-Executors have explained several times to the Attorney General, 
the Release is aimed at protecting the assets of the Estate by ensuring that an individual claimant 
does not "double dip" -
i.e., she cannot both elect to (1) receive full compensation from the Estate 
through the Program, and also (2) sue individuals affiliated with the Estate who may well implead 
the Estate under doctrines of contribution, indemnification, respondeat superior or otherwise.4 
The Co-Executors' duties under Virgin Islands law require them to protect the Estate's assets, 
including for the benefit of its creditors and claimants. The Release is indispensable in achieving 
that result. 
Nor should the Court accept the Attorney General's straw-man formulation that, 
"[a]ssuming a fairly bargained transaction, the Estate would have to offer increased compensation 
to victims to secure the third-party release to satisfy claims for which it has no legal responsibility." 
(4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 4.) As explained above, the Release is not aimed at claims for 
3. The subjects of the Release are limited to the individuals or entities affiliated with or who provided 
services to Mr. Epstein, as follows: 
"The Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the 'Epstein Estate'), the Co-
Trustees of The 1953 Trust, the Epstein Estate, any entities owned or controlled in whole 
or part by the Estate (the 'Epstein Entities') and their respective current and former 
principals, officers, directors, stockholders, managers, members, partners, limited partners, 
trustees, beneficiaries, administrators, agents, employees, attorneys, predecessors, 
successors, assigns and affiliates, and any entities or individuals who are or have ever been 
engaged by (whether as independent contractors or otherwise), employed by, worked in 
any capacity for, or provided any services to Mr. Epstein, the Epstein Entities or the Epstein 
Estate." (Ex. A at 1-2.) 
The Release specifically provides that it will not release third parties unaffiliated with the Epstein 
Entities, including individuals specified by the claimant. (Id. at 4.) 
4. This is no theoretical risk. On March 12, 2020, one of the primary individuals alleged to have worked 
as a "recruiter" of young women for Mr. Epstein brought suit in the Virgin Islands against the Estate 
and the Co-Executors, demanding indemnification. Ghislaine Maxwell v. Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
et al., Civil Case No. ST-20-CV-155 (Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and 
St. John). 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 5 of 17

Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 5 
which the Estate "has no legal responsibility". Rather, its function is exactly the opposite: the 
Release's acknowledged purpose is to avoid having the Estate pulled into litigation by individuals 
who claim that the Estate is legally responsible for their actions. And, as claimants' counsel Mr. 
Boies recognized, the Program will properly offer compensation to legitimate claimants that 
reflects their release of any third parties who are affiliated with Mr. Epstein or the Estate. 
Consistent with their fiduciary duties, the Co-Executors determined that the benefits of 
including within the Release those individuals who may claim (as Ms. Maxwell has already done) 
that the Estate bears financial responsibility for the claims against them, substantially outweighs 
the downside of not requiring a release of those persons. Those downsides include that the Co-
Executors would be forced to ( 1) litigate against the very claimants the Estate will have 
compensated through the Program and thereby sought to both avoid being adverse to those 
claimants and incurring the financial costs oflitigating against them; (2) litigate alongside persons 
for harms caused by their alleged conduct for which the Estate has already paid the plaintiff; and 
(3) pay twice for any harm caused by Mr. Epstein if the damages awarded in that litigation focus 
not just on the conduct of the released person but also Mr. Epstein's conduct.5 
3. 
The Attorney General Lacks Standing to Re-Shape the Program Developed 
b the Co-Executors and Experts in the Field 
More than two months ago-but five months after the Co-Executors and the independent 
claims program experts began working arduously to establish the Program- the Attorney General 
sought to intervene in this probate proceeding in order to oppose the Co-Executors' 
5. The Court should not credit the Attorney General's bizarre complaint that some claimants "may not 
even know the identity of their abusers," and thus could not specify them in the liability carve-out of 
the Release. (4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 3.) None of the 32 claimants who have filed lawsuits to 
date has been unable to identify her claimed abuser. Moreover, any claimant who cannot identify a 
purported abuser would not succeed in litigation.against that person, since one cannot enforce a money 
judgment against an unnamed, unknown party.

implementation of the Program.6 At the hearing on February 4, 2020, during which the Attorney 
General displayed her disregard for probate procedures and the Court's statutory authority, the 
Court expressly denied the Attorney General's motion. (February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr. at 98:8-12.) 
Accordingly, the Attorney General has no standing to demand that the Court re-shape the Program 
to suit her preferences or priorities. That includes her most recent demand that the Court ignore 
the Co-Executors, claimants' counsel and acknowledged experts in the field in order to rewrite the 
text of the Release. 
Just as the Attorney General sought to position herself as a substitute for the Court in 
reviewing and approving the Co-Executors' regular administration of the Estate, she now seeks 
to assume the mantle of Program overseer: demanding that her own hand-picked choice (Marci 
Hamilton) be placed on the Program's payroll; requiring that $25 million from the Estate be made 
unavailable to pay legitimate claimants through the Program; 7 and rewriting the scope of the 
Release when everyone but her- including claimants' counsel, whose clients (unlike the Attorney 
General) would sign the Release -
has accepted that Release as written. That is improper. 
The Attorney General has no right to inject herself into the Program, dictating its policies, 
procedures and administration. To allow her to do so would rob the Program of its independence, 
one of its most critical attributes. And the Attorney General has no business forcing the Court to 
act as umpire on each of her dissatisfactions with the Program; as the Court indicated on more than 
one occasion, it is up to the Co-Executors -
acting as duly appointed extensions of the Court -
6. See Attorney General's Motion to Intervene, filed January 23, 2020 (attaching Government's 
Opposition to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Program). 
7. The Attorney General's separate CICO action would, if successful, remove an additional approximately 
$150 million from the Estate's assets. Her public pronouncements notwithstanding, the Attorney 
General has never offered to make a penny of those Funds available to victims of sexual abuse.

to fulfill their fiduciary duties to the Estate. As designed and to be implemented by nationally 
recognized experts, and as approved by virtuaUy every claimants' counsel, the Epstein Victims' 
Compensation Program accomplishes that precise goal. 8

As in their March 24, 2020 application, the Co-Executors again ask the Court to allow them 
to continue to perform their fiduciary duties, and -
for the benefit of all stakeholders in the Estate, 
including those women who seek to participate in the Program -
grant their motion to establish 
the Program as originally conceived and presented to the Court on November 14, 2019.

Mr. Boies' co-counsel, Kevin D' Amour, echoed the statements of numerous claimants' counsel at the 
February 4, 2020 hearing: "I think if we go forward with this program we are going to see great results 
and I think we are going to have a much better outcome ifwe can go forward with this program as soon 
as possible." (February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr. at 88:15-19.) The Court summarized the view of those 
present at that hearing, noting as follows: "I think we agreed that everybody believes this program is a 
great program ... " (Id. at 113:24-25.)

stockholders, managers, members, partners, limited partners, trustees, beneficiaries, 
administrators, agents, employees, attorneys, predecessors, successors, assigns and 
affiliates, and any entities or individuals who are or have ever been engaged by (whether 
as independent contractors or otherwise), employed by, worked in any capacity for, or 
provided any services to Mr. Epstein, the Epstein Entities or the Epstein Estate Gointly 
and severally, the "Releasees"), from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of 
action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, variances, trespasses, damages and 
judgments, whether sounding in equity, tort, common law, contract, statute, regulation 
or otherwise and whether now existing, hereafter existing or revived in the future 
whatsoever in law, admiralty, equity or otherwise, including without limitation any and 
all claims or causes of action that arise or may arise from or which otherwise concern acts

This General Release is a broad release of any and all Claims of Releasor against 
any and all Releasees, including without limitation any and all causes of action, lawsuits, 
claims, demands, damages and liability whatsoever, and also including without 
limitation to the extent of their respective liability for the same, any and all such claims

she is releasing any and all such unknown or unsuspected Claims in Releasor' s favor. 
Releasor acknowledges that she is familiar with Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, 
which provides as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE 
CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN 
HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF 
KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HA VE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER 
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
Releasor expressly waives and relinquishes any right or benefit that Releasor has 
or may have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code and under any other statute 
or legal principle with similar effect. In connection with such waiver and relinquishment, 
Releasor acknowledges that she is aware that, after executing this General Release, 
Releasor or Releasor' s attorneys or agents may discover released Claims or facts in 
addition to, or different from, those which they now know or believe to exist with respect 
to the subject matter of this General Release, but that it is Releasor' s intent hereby to fully, 
finally and forever settle and release all of the Claims, whether known or unknown, 
suspected or unsuspected, which now exist, may exist, or heretofore may have existed. 
In furtherance of this intent, this General Release shall be, and remain in effect as, a full 
and complete release of the Claims notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any 
such additional or different Claims or facts. 
The Administrator of the EVCP has retained _______ to confirm that

his or its own costs and attorneys' fees. 
This General Release contains the entire understanding of the Releasor and the Co-

I spoke with Dan and Andy (whom I am copying) this morning. I am now in agreement that we should move forward with 
the claims process without trying to further modify the release. I am influenced by the desirability of getting the program 
underway so that our clients can begin getting compensation; by the fact that the release will be limited to persons who 
provided services to Epstein, with the lease signed by individual victims who accept an award having a space to make 
clear that certain individuals (e.g., Prince Andrew or others to whom our clients were trafficked) are not released; and by 
the fact that the release of Epstein's employees/service providers will be taken into account by the Administrator in setting 
the amount of the award. And, of course, this is a voluntary process where our clients get to decide whether to be bound 
after learning the amount of the proposed award.

We are now both on the same page. I would like, with your permission, to forward that email to the AG, as I voiced a very 
similar position to her yesterday.
