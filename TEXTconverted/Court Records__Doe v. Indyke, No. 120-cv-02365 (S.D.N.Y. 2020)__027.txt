Re: 
Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as 
the Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-02365(LJL)(DCF) 
 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
 
 
I represent Jane Doe in the above referenced litigation.  I write to respectfully request a 
one week extension to submit Plaintiff’s motion to proceed anonymously in the above referenced 
action. Defendant consents to this request. 
 
 
For the past week I have been preparing and participating in an arbitration which has 
prevented me from focusing on other matters. 
 
 
Thank you for your time and attention. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Respectfully submitted, 
 
Daniel J. Kaiser
