DECLARATION OF ADAM D. HOROWITZ 
My name is Adam D. Horowitz. I am an attorney for Jane Doe No. 4. 
The deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 was scheduled for September 16, 2009 at 1:00 
_ p.m. at 350 Australian Ave. South, Suite 115, West Palm Beach, Florida. On the day before the 
deposition, the undersigned and counsel for Jeffrey Epstein entered into a written stipulation in 
which it was agreed that "Jeffrey Epstein will not attend tomorrow's deposition of Jane Doe No. 
4 (in the absence of a court order peimitting him to attend)." It was further agreed that Jeffrey 
Epstein may Hsten in to the deposition by telephone or .view a videofeed of the deposition, but 
under no circumstances would he "be seen by our client." 
3. 
While Jane Doe No. _4 and I were in the lobby of 350 Australian Ave South at 
approximately 1:00 p.m. for her deposition on September 16, 2009, we crossed paths with 
Jeffrey Epstein and someone who appeared to be his bodyguard. Jeffrey Epstein stopped

walking and began to stare at and intimidate Jane Doe No. 4. Jane Doe No. 4 was tenified, 
began crying and ran outside the building. Jeffrey Epstein_ smirked at her and walked away. 
4. 
As a result of this incident, Jane Doe began crying uncontrollably and was unable 
to proceed with her deposition. 
Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have read the foregoing Declaration and the 
facts stated in it are true.

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 305 
Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2009 
Page 3 of 8 
9. 
As of 1:00 p.m., no order had been received from the court, so Epstein's 
attorneys, in good faith, decided that Epstein would not attend the deposition (as per the 
agreement), if we chose to proceed, • which we were doing. The undersigned and Mr. Luttier 
specifically waited until just after 1 :00 o'clock, the time that the deposition was to start, prior to 
leaving with Mr. Epstein. Counsel ·instructed Mr. Epstein to leave the building. Clearly,. 
Defendant and his counsel simply wish to have meaningful discovery. 
10. 
The undersigned and Mr. Luttier exited the elev~or heading toward the 
deposition room and Mr. Epstein and his driver, Igor Zinoviev exited in separate elevator at the 
• same time and turned to depart from through the front entrance such that he could go to his home 
to watch the deposition and assist counsel, from a video feed. 
11. 
Completely unbelmownst and unexpected by anyone, apparently the Plaintiff and 
her attorney(s) were at the front door where Mr. Epstein was intending to exit. Upon seeing two 
women, one who might be the Plaintiff, Mr. Epstein immediately made a left turn and exited 
through a separate set of doors to the garage area. See affidavit of Jeffrey Epstein and Igor 
Zinoviev, Exhibit 4 and 5, respectively. 
12. 
The entire incident was completely unknown to the undersigned and Mr. Luttier 
until Adam Horowitz, Esq. came in and announced that the deposition was not going to take 
• place in that Mr. Epstein and his client saw one another, she was upset and therefore the 
deposition was cancelled from his perspective. 
13. 
The undersigned and his partner, Mr. Luttier, had a court reporter and a 
videographer present. Additionally, Mr. Hill on behalf of C.M .. A., Adam. Langino on behalf of 
B.B., William Berger on behalf of three Plaintiffs were present for the deposition.

14. 
Any suggestion that the chance "visual" between Mr. Epstein and Jane Doe No. 4 
was "pre-planned" would be absurd, disingenuous and false. The undersigned counsel went out 
of his way to make certain Mr. Epstein would not be in the building after the time the deposition 
was set to begin. Had the Plaintiff and her counsel been in the deposition room at the appointed 
time, no visual contact would have occurred. 
15. 
It is possible that Plaintiff's counsel, by filing their motion for_ protective order on 
September 9, 2009 and then advising the undersigned on September 14, 2009 that the deposition 
would not go forward unless the undersigned agreed to exclude Mr. Epstein from the deposition, 
were not prepared and/or did not want to proceed with the deposition. 
16. 
• The_ unilateral termination of the deposition was unnecessary, inappropriate and a 
substantial waste of attorney time and the costs related to the deposition ( court reporter and 
videographer). (See Affidavit of Robert D. Critton, Jr., Mark T. Ln.ttier and Deposition 
Transcript, Exhibits 6, 7, and 8 respectively). 
17. 
Had the "visual" been premeditated, the cancellation of the deposition may have 
been justified, however, under these circumstances, it was grandstanding and improper. In that 
• the Plaintiff has stated that she voluntary went to JE's home 50 plus times without trauma until 
she filed a lawsuit, this brief visual encounter from a distance should not have resulted in the 
unilateral cancellation of her deposition. 
18. 
The costs associated with the court reporter and videographer total $428.80 .. See 
··Exhibit 9. 
Memorandum of Law In support of Motion 
A substantial amount of administrative time went into the setting up the deposition of 
Jane Doe No. 4. Almost two months passed from the time that the Defendant's counsel first

Document 305

Page 5 of 8 
requested a date for the deposition of Jane Doe No. 4. The deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 was to 
begin at 1:00 p.m, based on her schedule, and was moved from the undersigned's office to the 
office of the court reporter at her counsel's request. 
Pursuant to Rule 30(d)(2) and (3)(A) and (C) and its reference to 37(a)(5)), Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the court may impose an appropriate sanction, including reasonable expenses 
in attorneys fees incurred by any party on a person who impedes or delays the fair examination 
of the deponent. fu this instance, the brief visual encounter, which was completely unintended 
and inadvertent, should not have been grounds for Plaintiff's counsel and Plaintiff refusing to 
move forward with . the deposition. Furthermore, pursuant to (3)(A) and (C), Plaintiff and 
Plaintiff's counsel had no right to unilaterally terminate/cancel the deposition and fail to move 
forward. Plaintiff should have continued with the deposition and filed any motion deemed 
• appropriate post deposition. Therefore, Defendant is asking for the costs associated with the 
attendance of the court reporter, her transcript and the presence of the videographer. Defendant 
would also request reasonable fees for 2.5 hours at $500 per hour for being required to prepare 
this motion and affidavits associated with same. 
The records obtained thus far on Jane Doe No. 4, do not reflect any "emotional trauma" 
by her own account of some 50 plus visits to the Defendant's home prior to the time that she 
hired an attorney. Even in her interview with attorney's handpicked expert, Dr. Kliman, by her 
own comments, her significant emotional trauma relates to physical and verbal abuse by a prior 
boyfriend, Preston Vineyard, and deaths associated with two close friends, Chris and Jen. 
Therefore, the supposed "emotional trauma" caused by a chance encounter resulting in a 
"glance" at best, should not be the basis for Plaintiff unilaterally cancelling her deposition.

your client. He does not intend to engage in ~ny conversation with your client.. However, It

Response In Opposition To Plaintiffs', Jane Doe Nos. 2-8, Motion For Protective Order As To 
Jeffrey Epstein's Attendance At The Deposition Of Plaintiffs. In support, Epstein states: 
Introduction and Background 
1. 
On August 19, 2009, Defendant sent a Notice for Taking the Deposition of Jane 
Doe No. 4 for September 16, 2009. See Exhibit "l"

2. 
Additionally. notices were sent out in other cases in connection with deposing 
additional Plaintiffs. 
3. 
No objection(s) was/were received for Jane Doe No. 4, which was the only 
deposition set relative to the Jane Doe 2-8 Plaintiffs. 
4. 
On August 27, 2009, the undersigned counsel sent a letter to counsel for Jane Doe 
No. 4 concerning her deposition and the scheduling of same on the above date. See Exhibit "2". 
5. 
No response was received until counsel for Jane Doe No. 4 called on September 
8, 2009, approximately eight days prior to the scheduled deposition, to indicate that they now 
had an objection and would be filing a motion for protective order seeking to prevent Epstein 
from attending the deposition. Once again, Plaintiffs are attempting to stifle this litigation 
through their own delay tactics during discovery. Plaintiffs wish not only to attempt to force 
Epstein to trial without any meaningful discovery, but now wish to ban Epstein from any 
depositions. thereby preventing him from assisting bis attorneys in his very own defense. What's 
next - will Plaintiffs seek to prevent Epstein from attending any of the trials that result from the 
lawsuits Jane Does 2-8 have initiated? Plaintiffs see millions of dollars in ·damages, both 
compensatory and punitive, against Defendant. 
6. 
Defendant is filing this emergency motion and his immediate response to the 
motion for protective order to guarantee his right to be present and assist counsel in deposing not 
only Jane Doe No. 4, but o1her plaintiffs and witnesses in these cases. To hold otherwise would 
violate Epstein's due process rights to defend the very allegations Plaintiffs have alleged against 
him. Does a Defendant not have a right to be present at depositions or other court proceedings to 
------ --- - -·--- -
assist counsel with the defense of his case? Does a Defendant, no matter what the charges or the 
allegations, have full and unbridled access to the court system and tne proceedings it governs,

including discovery? The short answer is unequivocally, yes. To hold otherwise would be a 
direct violation of Epstein's constitutional due process rights. Plaintiffs' attempts to play fast 
and loose with the law should not be tolerated. 
7. 
As the court is aware, plaintiffs and defendants routinely attend depositions of 
parties and other witnesses in both State and Federal court proceedings. In fact, parties have a 
right under the law to attend such depositions. 
8. 
. As the court will note from Exhibit 2, counsel for the Defendant specifically 
stated that •'Please be advised that Mr. Epstein plans to be in attendance at the deposition of your 
client. He does not intend to engage in any conversation with your client. However, it is 
certainly his right as a party-defendant in the lawsuit to be present and to assist counsel in the 
defense of any case." Despite this right, Plaintiffs continue to attempt to control how discovery 
is conducted in this case and how this court has historically governed discovery. 
9. 
Interestingly, in Jane Doe I1, the state court case, attorney Sid Garcia took the 
deposition of the Defendant and his client, Jane Doe II, was present throughout the deposition. 
This is despite her claims of "emotional trauma" set forth hi her complaint. Jane Doe No. II is 
also a Plaintiff in the federal court proceeding Jane Doe II v. Jeffeey Epstein (Case No. 09-CIV-
80469). ls this court going to start a precedent where it allows Plaintiffs to attend the depositions 
of Jeffrey Epstein. but not allow Epstein to attend their depositions (i.e., the very Plaintiffs that 
have asserted claims against him for millions of dollars)? This court should not condone such a 
practice. 
10. 
The undersigned is well aware of the court's No-Contact Order entered on July 
31, 2009 {DE 238). A copy of the order is attached as Exhibit "3". In fact, the order provides 
that the defendant have no direct or indirect contact with the plaintiffs, nor communications with

the plaintiffs either directly or indirectly. However, there is no prohibition against Mr. Epstein's 
attendance at a deposition where, as is reflected in the order, the communication will be made to 
the plaintiff solely through defense counsel with one or more of plaintiffs' cowisel of record 
present in the room in a videotaped depo_sition. Obviously, any inappropriate contact or 
communication will certainly be flagged by the attorneys in attendance. As such. Plaintiffs 
really have the cart before the horse in this instance (i.e., nothing prevents Epstein from attending 
these depositions and, to the extent Plaintiffs believe that something improper occurs at any 
deposition, only then can that circumstance be addressed by a motion such as the instant one.) 
11. 
Next, Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-8, attempt to use the Affidavit of Dr. Kliman for 
every motion for protective order/objection filed to date. This also includes the two most recent 
motions, which attempt to prevent Defendant's investigators from doing their job, such that the 
Defendant and his attorneys can defend the claims asserted in these cases. Plaintiffs lose sight of 
the fact that the court, in discussing the Non-Prosecution Agreement, inquired as to whether 
Epstein and his counsel could fully defend the ~ 
which included discovery and investigation. 
AU plaintiffs' counsel and the USAO responded in the affinnative. In fact, Plaintiffs universally 
agreed at the June 12, 2009 hearing on Defendant's Motion to Stay that regular discovery could 
proceed. See Composite Exhibit "4" at pages 26-30 & 33-34. For instance,.the court asked 
Plaintiffs' attorneys the foJlowing questions: 
The Court: D So again, I just want to make sure that if the cases go forward and 
if Mr. Epstein defends the case as someone ordinarily would defend a case being 
prosecuted against him or her, that that in and ofitselfis not going to cause him to 
be subject to criminal prosecution? (Ex. "A," p.26). 
• 
••• 
The Court: You agree he should be able to take the ordinary steps that a 
defendant in a civil action can take and not be concerned about having to be 
prosecuted? (Ex, "A," p.27).

The Court: Okay. But again, you're in agreement with everyone else so far 
that's spoken on behalf of a plaintiff that defending the case in the normal course 
of conducting discovery and filing motions would not be a breach? (Ex. "A," 
p.30). 
• 
Mr. Horowitz- counsel for Jane Does 2-7: Subject to your rulings, of course, 
yes. (Ex. "A," p.30). 
The Court: But you're not talcing the position that other than possibly doing 
something in litigation which is any other discovery, motion practice, 
investlgallons that someone would ordinarily do in the course of defending a civil 
case would constitute a violation of the agreement? (Ex. "A,'1 p.34). 
Ms. Villafana: No, your honor. I mean, civil litigation is civil litigation, and • 
being able to take discovery is part of what civil litigation is all about ... But. .. , 
Mr. Epstein is entitled to talce the deposition of a Plaintiff and to subpoena 
records, etc. (Ex. "A,'' p.34) 
12. 
It is clear from the transcript attached as Exhibit "4" that each of the Plaintiffs' 
attorneys, incJuding Mr. Horowitz for Jane Does 2-8, expected and conceded that 
regular/traditional discovery would talce place (i.e., discovery, motion practice, depositions, 
requests for records, and investigations). 
13. 
Importantly, Plaintiffs' counsel advised the undersigned that they coordinate their 
efforts in joint conference calls at least two times per month. At recent depositions of two 
witnesses, Alfredo Rodriguez and Juan Alessi, five different plaintiffs' attorneys questioned the 
witnesses for approximately six to eight hours, often repeating the same or similar questions that 
had previously been asked. 
14. 
Clearly, the Plaintiffs' counsel wish to control discovery and how the Defendant 
is allowed to obtain information to defend these cases. However, the court has ruled on a 
number of these issues as follows: 
A. 
Plaintiffs' counsels sought to preclude the Defendant from serving third 
party subpoenas and allo~ only Plaintiffs• counsel to obtain

~ge6 
depositions and those materials and "filter them" to defense counsel. 
That motion was denied, and the court tailored a method such that the 
Defendant could obtain the records directly. 
B. 
Plaintiffs' counsels sought to limit the psychological psychiatric 
examination in C.MA. v. Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen {Case No. 08-
CIV-80811 ), as to time, subject matter and scope. However, Magistrate 
Johnson entered an order denying the requested restrictions. 
C. 
Other Plaintiffs' attorneys have said that they object to requested 
psychological exam of ~eir client(s), thus motions for such exams will 
now need to be filed; yet all seek millions of dollars in damages for 
alleged psychological and emotional ~uma. 
D. 
Many Plaintiffs' object to disoovery regarding current and past 
employment (although they are seeking loss of income, both in past and 
future). 
E. 
All Plaintiffs object to prior sexual history, consensual and forced as 
being irrelevant, although .in many of the medical records that are now 
being obtained, as well as the psychiatric exams done by Dr. K.Jiman, 
there is reference to rape, molestation, abusive relationships (both 
physical and verbal), prior abortions, illegal drugs and alcohol abuse. 
15. 
Clearly, Plaintiffs wish to make allegations; however, they forget that they must 
meet their burden by proving same. Meeting that burden and disproving those allegations is not 
possible if this court allows Plaintiffs to stifle and/or control the discovery process. 
16. 
Specifically, with regard to Jane Doe No. 4, which is the deposition set for next 
week, September 16, 2009, the plaintiff has in her past (see affidavit of Richard C.W. Hall, 
M.D., an expert psychiatrist retained by Defendant to conduct exams on various claimants.) See 
Exhibit "5"

D. 
Spoke with two psychiatrists when she was sixteen or seventeen (before 
this lawsuit!) and did not reference Epstein. but did reference her 
boyfriend and family issues. 
17. 
There are police reports that reflect that: 
A. 
In September 2004, a battery report was filed regarding Jane Doe No. 4 
and Vinyard based on an argument where he grabbed her by the neck and 
began spitting on her and calling her a cheater. 
B. 
Also in September 2004, there was a domestic violence file opened where 
Vinyard was physically and verbally abusive to Jane Doe No. 4, his 
girl.friend at the time. There is reference that the two started a serious 
relationship in January 2002, when she was only fourteen (14) years old. 
C. 
Vinyard was arrested in December 2003, and charged with· reckless 
driving and leaving the scene of the accident with Jane Doe No. 4, when 
their vehicle hit a tree and they fled. 
18. 
Moreover, an ex-boyfriend of Jane Doe No. 4 died in a DUI accident and it took 
her two years to get over his death, and another good friend of hers, "Jen," died in an automobile 
accident involving drinking. Within her Amended Complaint and Answers to Interrogatories, 
she indicates that she went to Epstein's house on several occasions. However, at no time did she • 
call the police, at no time did she report any traumatic or severe emotional trauma, nor alleged 
coercion, force or improper behavior by Epstein until she got a "lawyer" and is now pursuing 
claims for millions of dollars_. Epstein's assistance to his attorneys at these depositions regarding 
the above issues is not only a constitutional due process right afforded to him but essential given 
the fact that this court has ruled that Plaintiffs' depositions can only occur one time. no "second 
bite" absent a court order. 
19. 
Given the breadth of the allegations made against Epstein and the substantial 
damages sought, Epstein has an unequivocal and constitutional right to be present at any 
deposition such that he can assist bis cowisel with the defense of these cases. See iefra. Dr. HaD

247. 
Memorandum Of Law 
20. 
Plaintiffs' motion is required to be denied as they have failed to meet their burden 
showing the "extraordinary circwnstances" necessary to establish good cause to support a 
protective order which would grant the extraordinarily rare relief of preventing a named party 
from attending in person the deposition of another named party. Also requiring denial of 
Plaintiffs' motion is the fact that it seeks to exclude Epstein from all the depositions of all the 
Plaintiffs in actions before this Court. Such relief is unprecedented and attempts to have this 
Court look at the Plaintiffs• collectively as opposed to analyzing each case based on facts versus 
broad speculation whether "extraordinary circumstances,. exist on a case by case basis. In other 
words, the standard is such that the Court would be required to determine whether each Plaintiff 
has met her burden, should the Court consider adopting such eKtraordinary relief. On its face, 
the motion does not meet the necessary burden as to Jane Doe 4, or Jane Does 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 . . 
Discussion of Law Requiring the Denial of the Requested Protective Order 
Rule 26(c)(l)(E), Fed.RCjv.P. (2009), governing protective orders, provides in relevant 
part that: 
(1) In General A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for 
a protective or<;ier in the court where the action is pending- or as an alternative on 
matters relating to a deposition, in the court for the district where the deposition will 
be taken. The motion must foclude a certification that the movant bas in good faith 
conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the 
dispute without court action. The court may, for good cause, issue an order to 
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or 
undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:

In seeking to prevent the Defendant from being present in the room where the Plaintiffs 
are being deposed, Plaintiffs generally rely on treatise material from Wright & Miller, 8 Federal 
Practice & Procedure Civ.2d. §204 I, and cases cited therein. The case of Gaella v. Onassjs, 487 
F 2d 986; at 997 (2d Cir. 1973), cited by Plaintiffs, makes clear that the exclusion of a party from 
a deposition ''should be ordered rarely indeed." Unlike the Gaella case, there is no showing by 
each of the Plaintiffs that there has been any conduct by ·Epstein, in rightfully defending the 
actions filed against him, reflecting "an irrepressible intent to continue . . . harassment'' of any 
Plaintiff or a complete disregard of the judicial process., i.e. prior alleged conduct versus any 
action/conduct displayed in this or other cases that would justify extraordinary relief: There is 
absolutely no basis in the record to indicate that Epstein will act other than properly and with the 
proper decorum at the depositions of the Plaintiffs and abide in all respects with the No-Contact 
Order. 
Wherefore, Epstein respectfully requests that this Court enter an order denying Plaintiffs' 
Motion for Protective Order, provide that Epstein is permitted to attend the depositions of the 
Plaintiffs that have ass~d claims against him in the related matters, and for such other and 
further relief as this court deems just and proper.

my client's intent specificaJly, because I also 
advised him that he was not to cross paths, not 
• • to have any contact with your client, and 
certainly by our agreement not to be here today 
for the deposition. 
MR. HOROWITZ: And at approximately 1 :00 
is exactly when my client crossed paths with 
Jeffrey Epstein. And not only did he cross 
paths but he proceeded to stare her down just 
f~et away from her. For that reason she became 
an emotional wreck and cannot proceed with the 
• deposition. She's simply not in an emotional 
state to do so. 
• 
-And in addition Mr. Epstein violated the 
agreement between counsel that he would not 
cross paths 'or come into contact with our 
client. And it will be also for the criminal 
court judge to decide whether he has violated a 
no-contact order." I have nothing else to say. 
MR. CRITTON: Again I instructed 
Mr. Epstein to leave the building so absolutely 
• rio contact could occur between he and 
Mr. Horowitz and his client nor anyone else. 
· Until the court, until either Judge Marra or 
Judge Johnson ruled on the issue as to whether 
Page 7 
or not he C9uld apPear at the depositions of 
not only Jane Doe 4 but any other individuals, 
so you do what you need to do. 
MR. HOROWITZ: Off the record.

Neither do I, which is

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We have done our due 
_diligence, .f .or.-what- it '-s --woi-th.., there is a 
residential street. · There are not childre~ 
congregating on that street. 
We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Dis, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There's several. 
THE COURT: 
Several, all of the 
victims. 
So this should be plural . 
I'm 
making that plural. 
You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this -
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. 
By 
indirect, we mean no text messag~s, n o 
e~mail, no Face Book, no My Space , no 
telephone calls, no voice mails, no

messages through third parties, no hey 
would you tell so and so for me, no having 
21 
a friend, acquaintance or stranger approach 
any of these victims with a message of any 
sort from you, is that clear? 
THE DEFENDANT~ 
Yes, ma'am 
'J:'r{J:; ~Q@'J.': .. . And then it states, 
unless approved by the victim, the 
therapist ~nd the sentencing court. ·okay. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
I understand. 
THE COURT : 
And the sentencing court. 
So, if there is a desire which, ! would 
think would be a bit strange to have 
conta~t with any of the victims the court 
must approve it. 
MS. BELOHLAVBK: 
Correct. · 
THE COURT: 
I~ the victim was under 
t he age of 18, which was the case, you 
shall not until you have successfully 
attended and completed ehe sex offender 
program. 
So, is this sex off~nder program 
becoming a condition of probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
That is no·t. 
I 
don't bel ieve I circled that one.
