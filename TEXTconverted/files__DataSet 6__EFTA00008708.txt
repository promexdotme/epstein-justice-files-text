MS. 
Let the record reflect that there are 
17 grand jurors present and that the foreperson is present. 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is 
and I am an Assistant United States Attorney 
here in the Southern District of New York. 
Can everyone hear me okay? All right. I see 
everybody's heads nodding. Thank you. 
I am here today to present for your consideration 
a proposed superseding indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
in six counts. This indictment is virtually identical to 
the indictment that you returned last week charging Maxwell 
in those same six counts except that it corrects two 
clerical errors, or two typographical errors that were 
contained in Counts Five and Six which are the perjury 
charges. 
As a result, I will not be presenting any new 
evidence or new witnesses today. Instead, I will identify 
for you those two clerical errors in the indictment. I will 
point out the portion of the exhibits that you saw last week 
that provide the correct information. Then I will identify 
the corrected portion of the superseding indictment in the 
proposed superseding indictment. 
Before I do that though, I must ask you all the

same preliminary questions that we went over last week. 
First, do any of you believe that you personally know or 
have met the proposed defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell? I see 
no hands. 
Next, have you any heard or read about, or learned 
anything Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein or anyone else 
related to this case, if you could just raise your hand? I 
see a number of hands. Virtually every hand is in the air. 
You can all put your hands down. Thank you. 
As you know, you must make your determination as a 
grand jury based on the evidence presented before you in the 
grand jury, in this room alone. Accordingly, you must set 
aside any other knowledge you may have about this case or 
the people involved in it, and base your decision solely on 
the evidence presented to this grand jury to determine 
whether there is probable cause to believe that the charges 
in the proposed indictment were committed. 
Is there any grand juror here today who cannot 
follow these instructions? I see no hands. Just to be 
sure, is there any grand juror here who would have any 
difficulty setting aside the outside information you may 
have about the defendant or the facts of this case? I see 
no hands. 
Finally, do any of you believe you know me in 
anything other than my professional capacity? I see no

hands. 
Now, as I mentioned, I will not be calling any 
witnesses today. Instead I will present you with the 
exhibits from last week, the transcript of the testimony you 
heard from last week and the proposed superseding 
indictment. I will then walk you through the error that the 
superseding indictment seeks to correct. 
Please keep in mind though that what I say is not 
evidence. Only the testimony of the witnesses and the 
exhibits are evidence. So as I'm walking you through these 
exhibits, your understanding of them and your understanding 
of the evidence controls. I am just trying to provide you 
with an overview. 
With that instruction in mind, I am going to put 
up onto the Elmo what was previously received and marked as 
Grand Jury Exhibit 1. That is the proposed six-count 
indictment that you voted to return last week. A copy of it 
will be available for review when you deliberate. 
You also received what has been marked as Grand 
Jury Exhibit 2, which I will not put up on the Elmo. Thar 
was a PowerPoint presentation containing photographs anc 
excerpts of certain documents that was shown to you during 
the testimony last week. You also heard testimony from FBI 
Special Agent 
Today I am marking, as Grand Jury Exhibit 3, a

copy of the transcript of that testimony. It is up on the 
Elmo now and it will be available for you to review if you 
would like as you deliberate. I will not read it back to 
you now, but you can read through it as you deliberate. 
Finally, I am marking, as Grand Jury Exhibit 4, 
the proposed superseding indictment, which I have now placed 
up on the Elmo. As I mentioned, this proposed superseding 
indictment corrects two clerical errors and is otherwise 
identical to the original indictment, Grand Jury Exhibit 1. 
I'm now going to walk you through the errors that 
we're going to correct starting on Grand Jury Exhibit 1. 
Page 15 contains the beginning of Count Five which charges 
Maxwell with perjury. Paragraph 21 on that page refers to 
the civil case in which Maxwell gave deposition testimony on 
April 22nd, 2016, as 15 Civ. 7344. That is the error we are 
going to correct. 
Similarly, page 16 contains the beginning of Count 
Six which charges another count of perjury. Paragraph 23 on 
that page refers to the civil case in which Maxwell gave 
deposition testimony on July 22nd, 2016, under the sare 
number, 15 Civ. 7344. 
Turning now to Grand Jury Exhibit 2. Slue 22 el 
that exhibit contains the first page of the deposition 
transcript from the testimony that Maxwell gave on 
April 22nd, 2016. As you can see here, the docket number

for that case is in fact 15 Civ. 7433 not 7344. 
Similarly, slide 25 contains the first page of cite 
transcript from the July 22nd, 2016 deposition that Maxwell 
gave. As you can see here, again, the docket number for 
that case is 15 Civ. 7433 not 7344. 
Finally, I will turn to the proposed indictment, 
Grand Jury Exhibit 4. On page 15, you have again the same 
perjury count with one change. Paragraph 21 corrects the 
docket number for the civil case to be 15 Civ. 7433. 
Similarly, on page 16, which contains the second 
perjury count for the July 22nd, 2016 deposition, the docket 
number is corrected to 15 Civ. 7433. There are otherwise no 
changes to the substance of this indictment. 
That is my presentation. Before I leave you to 
deliberate, would anyone like me to read the full proposed 
superseding indictment out loud? I see no hands. 
I must advise you that you must independently find 
probable cause, again, for each count in the superseding 
indictment. The evidence before you in support of the 
charges in the superseding indictment is the same evidence 
that was before you when you considered the indictment last 
week. 
Does anyone have any questions about that 
evidence? I see no hands.

voting on the indictment last week are the same instructions 
that apply to your consideration of the proposed superseding 
indictment. Would anyone like me to read those instructions 
out loud for you again? I see no hands. 
Does anyone have any questions about the legal 
instructions? I see no hands. 
I will leave you now with the exhibits to 
deliberate. As always, if you have any questions or 
concerns about the proposed indictment, please let me know 
before you vote so that I may answer any questions you may 
have on the law, or bring any additional evidence before you 
to consider. Thank you, all.
