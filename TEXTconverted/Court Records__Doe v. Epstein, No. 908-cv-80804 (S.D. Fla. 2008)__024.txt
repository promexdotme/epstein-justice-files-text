UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
 
CASE NO.:  08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
________________________________/ 
 
PLAINTIFF’S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT EPSTEIN’S MOTION TO DISMISS 
 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rule 7.1(A) of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for an enlargement of time to respond to 
Defendant Epstein’s Motion to Dismiss until fifteen days after the Court rules on her motion to 
remand.   
1. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008.  (DE 1).   
2. Plaintiff filed a motion to remand on August 18, 2008.  (DE 11).  It is Plaintiff’s 
contention that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because it 
does not involve a federal question or parties with complete diversity of citizenship. 
3. If this action was improperly removed and is, consequently, remanded to state court 
for lack of jurisdiction, it would be a waste of time and resources for Plaintiff to 
respond to and the Court to consider Defendant Epstein’s motion to dismiss.
