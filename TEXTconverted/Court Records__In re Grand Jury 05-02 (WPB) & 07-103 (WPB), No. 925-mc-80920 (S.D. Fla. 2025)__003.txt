UNITED STATES' RESPONSE TO ORDER ON SUPPLEMENTAL BREIFING 
Consistent with the Court's July 19, 2025 order, the United States files this supplemental 
brief addressing (I) the government's request to transfer this petition to the Southern District of 
New York; and (2) the government's request to unseal grand jury documents. 
A. 
The Court Should Transfer this Petition to the Southern District of New York 
In response to the second set of questions posed in the July 19, 2025 Order, the government 
responds as fol lows: (I) this petition is eligible for transfer to the Southern District of New York; 
(2) Rule 6(e)(3)(G) permits the transfer since the only judicial proceedings were in the Southern 
District of New York and not in the Southern District of Florida; and (3) this petition to disclose 
arose out of the highly-publicized indictment of Jeffrey Epstein and subsequent federal criminal 
trial of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. Further, this petition is ancillary 
to the New York Proceedings seeking the same relief. 
The petition is eligible for transfer to the Southern District of New York under Rule 
6(e)(3)(G), which states the following: 
(G) If the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, 
the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned 
court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper. If the petitioned court 
decides to transfer, it must send to the transferee court the material sought to be 
disclosed, iffeasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury 
secrecy. The transferee court must afford those persons identified in Rule 6(e)(3)(F) 
a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 2 of 14
Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(G) (emphasis added). 
This Petition to Disclose (filed on July 18, 2025) arises out of two highly publicizedjudicial 
proceedings in the Southern District of New York: the indictment and criminal prosecution of 
Jeffrey Epstein, United States v. Epstein, I: I 9-CR-490 (S.D.N.Y.), and the subsequent federal 
criminal indictment, trial, and conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New 
York, United States v. Maxwell, I :20-CR-330 (S.D.N.Y.). Indeed, the relief sought in this petition 
is ancillary to the relief sought in those cases. Motions seeking identical relief were 
contemporaneously filed in the Southern District of New York on July 18, 2025. 1 Rule 6(e)(3)(i) 
requires that this petition "must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened." As a result, 
this petition was also filed in this Court. 
The only judicial proceedings are in the Southern District of New York. In the July 19, 
2025 Order Requiring Supplemental Briefing, the Court defined the Southern District of Florida 
('·SDFL") grand jury proceedings as the "Florida Proceedings,'' and United States v. Maxwell, No. 
I :20-CR-330 (S.D.N.Y.) and United States v. Epstein, No. I: I 9-CR-490 (S.D.N.Y.) as the "New 
York Proceedings.'' But the "Florida Proceedings" were not judicial proceedings-they were grand 
jury proceedings. To that point, the Eleventh Circuit in Pitch distinguished between grand jury and 
judicial proceedings: "The grand jury is by design an institution independent from the Judicial 
Branch. Accordingly, the district court neither presides over the grand jury nor monitors its 
proceedings. In fact, Rule 6 does not permit the district judge to be present in the grand jury room 
at all." Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir. 2020) (en bane) (cleaned up); see 
also Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(d). 
1 Copies of those motions are attached hereto as Exhibits I and 2. 
2 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 3 of 14
Because the only judicial proceedings giving rise to this petition are located in the Southern 
District of New York, "the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the 
petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper." Fed. R. Crim. P. 
6(e)(3)(G). The underlying matters have been litigated in the Southern District of New York, but 
no similar action exists in the Southern District of Florida. The Southern District of New York can 
better assess the need for the release of transcripts resulting from those historic cases and the scope 
of necessary redactions based upon information already disseminated through the trial and public 
docket. Cf Douglas Oil Co. of Ca. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211,212 (1979) ("[T]he better 
practice would have been for the [petitioned] Court, after making a written evaluation of the need 
for continued grand jury secrecy and a determination that the limited evidence before it showed 
that disclosure might be appropriate, to send the requested materials to the [] Court where the civil 
cases were pending."); Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(G) ("If the petitioned court decides to transfer, it 
must send to the transferee court the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written 
evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury secrecy.''). Judicial efficiency counsels in favor of 
transferring this petition to the Southern District of New York so that one court may consider all 
the related materials and issue consistent rulings. 
B. 
This Investigation Constitutes a Special Circumstance Justifying Disclosure 
Consistent with its petition, the government recognizes that Eleventh Circuit precedent 
holds that no exception outside those expressly enumerated under Criminal Rule 6(e)(3) authorizes 
a court to publicly disclose grand jury materials. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, I 229 
( I Ith Cir. 2020) ( en bane). The government also recognizes that, in this circuit, only an en bane 
decision or the Supreme Court may overrule that decision. See generally Scott v. United States, 
890 F.3d 1239. 1257 (discussing prior-panel-precedent rule). 
3 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 4 of 14
That said, decisions from other circuits support public disclosure of grand jury materials 
under "special circumstances," including when a matter possesses historical interest by the public. 
See In re Biaggi. 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. 1973) (affirming release of grand jury witness 
testimony based on the "special circumstances" of the case); In re Craig, 13 I F.3d 99, I 02 (2d Cir. 
1997) ("[W]e hold today that there is nothing ... that prohibits historical interest, on its own, from 
justifying release of grand-jury material in an appropriate case."); Carlson v. United States, 837 
F.3d 753, 766-67 (7th Cir. 2016) ("While [the court's] inherent supervisory authority is limited to 
'preserving or enhancing the traditional functioning' of the grand jury, that includes the power to 
unseal grand jury materials in circumstances not addressed by Rule 6( e )(3 )(E). ") ( cleaned up). 
The Second Circuit's decision in In re Biaggi demonstrates that public interest in an 
investigation might constitute a special circumstance justifying public disclosure. There, the 
district court ordered the public disclosure of a political candidate's grand jury testimony given 
less than two years earlier. In re Biaggi, 4 78 F.2d at 490. The events preceding the district court's 
order included press coverage on how the candidate allegedly responded to questions during his 
testimony. See id. at 490-91. That coverage eventually led to a television broadcast during which 
the candidate announced that he would request to have his testimony reviewed by the court to 
determine whether he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to questions about his 
personal finances and assets. Id. at 491. Contrary to that more limited request, the U.S. Attorney 
moved for disclosure of all the candidate's testimony, which the district court ultimately ordered. 
Id. at 49 I. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's order because the candidate's more 
limited request "was framed .. . in such a manner as to create a false impression in light of the 
publicity that had given rise to it." Id. at 494. Thus, the Second Circuit concluded that the district 
court did not abuse its discretion considering the "special circumstances" of the case. See id. 
4 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 5 of 14
Similar to the U.S. Attorney's request in In re Biaggi, the governmenfs position here is 
that the public's strong interest in this historical investigation into Jeffrey Epstein constitutes a 
special circumstance justifying the public disclosure of grand jury materials. The public's interest 
in this investigation persists despite the findings from the Department of Justice and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation discussed in the July 5, 2025 memorandum. Given the historical public 
interest in this investigation, public disclosure of grand jury materials is justified under the special 
circumstances of this case. To the extent this Court's decision is preordained by Pitch, the 
government preserves its right to appeal that decision and rely on decisions from the Second and 
Seventh Circuit for support. 
Finally. many of the rationales supporting grand jury secrecy under Rule 6(e) no longer 
apply to this investigation because of Jeffrey Epstein's death. With this grandjury investigation no 
longer pending, concerns over the defendant's flight or obstruction or possible collusion among 
grand jury witnesses no longer apply. Therefore, the stasis of this investigation further justifies 
public disclosure of grand jury transcripts. See In re Pub. First Law Ctr., No. I :24-mc-00215-
TMB-NC, 2024 WL 1885724. at *6 (D. Haw. Apr. 29, 2024) ("[O]ther courts have noted that the 
policy rationale to preserve grand jury secrecy is less obvious after the grand jury proceedings 
have ended because the primary reasons for grand jury secrecy, namely to 'prevent flight, protect 
the jurors, and protect witnesses from being pressured,' are generally less applicable.") (footnote 
omitted). 
C. 
Conclusion 
This Court should transfer this petition to the Southern District of New York because this 
matter arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district under Rule 6(G). Alternatively. this 
Court should grant the government's petition and order the release of grand jury transcripts from 
5 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 6 of 14
this investigation because the strong public interest in this investigation constitutes "special 
circumstances" justifying release.

UNITED STATES' MOTION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS 
At the direction of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice hereby moves the Court 
to release grand jury transcripts associated with the above-referenced indictment. 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a 
memorandum describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to 
Jeffrey Epstein (the "Memorandum''). 1 The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the 
Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether evidence existed 
that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, 
no such evidence was uncovered during the review. 
Since July 6, 2025. there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the 
Memorandum ·s conclusions. While the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
continue to adhere to the conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American 
public is of the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the 
investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
into Epstein. the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury

transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other 
personal identifying infonnation. 2 The Department will work with the United States Attorney's 
Office for Southern District of New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related 
information and other personal identifying information prior to releasing the transcripts. 
Transparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect 
victims. 
1. 
On July 2, 2019, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York returned 
an indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2. On August 10, 2019, 
while awaiting trial, Epstein committed suicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York City. Soon after, the Court dismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52. 
2. 
On June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York charged 
Epstein's longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking 
and coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, 1 :20-cr-330, Dkt. No. I (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 
2020). In December 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts. Maxwell was sentenced 
to 240 months· imprisonment, and the Second Circuit later affirmed her convictions and sentence. 
See United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024). 
3. 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
announced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein's crimes and death. Since 
then, the public's interest in the Epstein matter has remained. Given this longstanding and 
legitimate interest, the government now moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with 
Epstein. 
2 The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States\'. ,\la.me//, 1 :20-cr-330 (S.D.N.Y.), and in the 
Southern District of Florida.

"It is a tradition of law that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain 
secret." In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. 1973). "[T]he tradition of secrecy,'" however, "is not 
absolute.'' In re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive, I 04 F. Supp. 3d 625,628 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Although 
Rule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand 
jury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that "there are certain 'special circumstances' in 
which release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule." In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d 99, I 02 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th 
Cir. 2016) ("Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent power. lt merely identifies a permissive 
list of situations where that power can be used."). One such '·special circumstance" is historical 
interest by the public. In re Craig, 131 F.3d at I 05. Under In re Craig, this Court retains discretion 
to determine ··whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and 
secrecy[.]" Id. 
5. 
Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested 
and concerned about the Epstein matter. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts 
after concluding that Epstein"s case qualifies as a matter of public concern. See Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court's February 29, 2024 Order, CA Florida
