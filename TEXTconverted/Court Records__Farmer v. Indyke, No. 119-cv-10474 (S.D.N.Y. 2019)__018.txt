Re: 
Maria Farmer v. Darren K. lndyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their 
Dear Judge Buchwald, 
capacities as the executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, 
Civil Action No. 19-cv-10474 
We are counsel to non-party Alan Dershowitz (hereinafter "Prof. Dershowitz"). We respectfully 
submit this letter in regard to the Court's decision dated December 23, 2019 [ECF No. 12] in which the 
<;ourt exercised its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(±)(1) to strike "redundant, immaterial, 
iinpertinent, and/or scandalous" content regarding Prof. Dershowitz sua sponte from the plaintiff Maria 
Farmer's complaint [ECF No. 1, ,r 39]. 
Although the Court's order provides the relief Prof. Dershowitz sought, plaintiff's complaint 
remains without amendment on the public docket with the stricken content intact. Dershowitz respectfully 
requests that the Court issue an order directing the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, with the stricken 
material contained in paragraph 39 omitted, lest this respected Court's order have no practical effect. 
CC: All Counsel of Record (via ECF)
