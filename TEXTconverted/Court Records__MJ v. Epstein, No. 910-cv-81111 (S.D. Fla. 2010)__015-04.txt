PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND FOR 
AN ORDER TO COMPEL AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW  
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, respectfully files this motion for entry of an order directed to 
Jean Luc Brunel and his counsel ordering them to show cause why they should not be 
held in contempt, for sanctions, and for an order compelling Jean Luc Brunel to appear 
for a deposition within 20 days.  After plaintiff Jane Doe served Brunel with a subpoena 
for a deposition in this case, his attorney, on his behalf, represented that Brunel would 
appear for a deposition if Jane Doe would postpone the scheduled deposition date.  As 
an accommodation to him, Jane Doe did postpone the scheduled deposition date, but 
then Brunel has not appeared as agreed for a deposition.  After much communication in 
an attempt to coordinate Brunel’s deposition, Brunel’s counsel represented that Brunel 
was outside of the country, and thus unavailable, when in fact he was inside the country

and easily available for a deposition.  Because of these false representations, this Court 
should direct Brunel and his counsel to show cause why they should not be held in 
contempt.   This Court should also compel Brunel to appear for the deposition that was 
previously scheduled and that he has avoided only through these false representations.  
Finally, the Court should sanction the appropriate person(s) for causing the undersigned 
to spend unnecessary time filing this motion. 
BACKGROUND 
 
Jane Doe personally served Jean Luc Brunel in New York City to appear for 
deposition in this case.  The subpoena indicated a deposition date of September 22, 
2009 at 10:00 A.M. in New York City, New York.   Brunel is an important witness in this 
case, as he is a good friend of Epstein’s and has information regarding Epstein’s pattern 
and practice of obtaining young girls for sexual purposes, relevant issues not yet 
admitted by Defendant Epstein. 
 
Shortly after Brunel was served, counsel for Jane Doe was contacted by Tama 
Beth Kudman, Esq., a licensed attorney in Florida.  Kudman stated that she represented 
Brunel with regard to the subpoena and that she would produce Brunel for deposition in 
West Palm Beach if Jane Doe would agree not to go forward with the deposition date in 
New York.  Counsel for Jane Doe honored that request, and with Kudman jointly 
arranged a deposition date for Brunel in West Palm Beach for October.   
 
Shortly before his deposition was to take place, Ms. Kudman contacted counsel 
for Jane Doe to move that deposition date because of a personal conflict.  Once again, 
counsel for Jane Doe agreed.  After several conversations regarding the deposition of

Brunel, Kudman asked that counsel for Jane Doe set Brunel for deposition in January of 
2010, as that was a time when she could assure his availability.   
 
In January, counsel for Jane Doe again contacted Ms. Kudman to arrange a 
mutually convenient deposition time.  Ms. Kudman stated that Brunel would be in 
Florida the first week of February and she would work to coordinate his deposition for 
that time.  
 
The undersigned’s office contacted Ms. Kudman’s office on several occasions in 
January to coordinate a February deposition date of Brunel.  On January 29, 2010, Ms. 
Kudman returned the call and left a voicemail apologizing for not returning the call 
sooner and indicating that she had only been waiting to hear from Mr. Brunel as to his 
availability, and she invited the undersigned to contact her the following week to set it 
up.  On February 5, 2010, counsel for Jane Doe contacted Ms. Kudman to coordinate 
Brunel’s deposition.  During that telephone conversation, Ms. Kudman represented that 
her client, Mr. Brunel, had previously left the country to go to his home country of 
France before the New Year.  Ms. Kudman further represented that while she believed 
he was going to return, it turned out that he had no plans to return.  Ms. Kudman also 
stated that if Brunel was in the country, she would make good on her representation that 
she would produce him.  However, she had just spoken to him via a telephone call from 
him in France. Brunel told Kudman that he was staying there indefinitely with no plans 
to return.  In subsequent telephone conversations, Ms. Kudman continued to represent 
that Mr. Brunel had been out of the country since sometime prior to the New Year and 
was not planning to return.

Counsel for Jane Doe responded that this representation seemed quite strange, 
since Brunel has a significant business in the United States.  Kudman replied that it was 
simply too expensive for him to return and that because of the expense he had no 
intentions of returning.  Counsel for Jane Doe then pointed out that when Brunel was 
served, Kudman had promised he would be produced for deposition.  Kudman replied 
that because he is in France with no plans to return there was simply nothing she could 
do.    Kudman further advised counsel for Jane Doe that if he wanted to take Brunel’s 
deposition in France, then it would be necessary to obtain a Letters Rogatory and go 
through the French Consulate.  After these procedures, Kudman then indicated it would 
be necessary to take a trip to France for his deposition.  Counsel for Jane Doe indicated 
that he might be willing to go through that process, but that he would like for Kudman to 
tell him if Brunel happened to return to the United States.  Kudman promised that she 
would.  
 
Remarkably, after all of these representations had been made by Kudman, it 
turns out that Brunel was actually in the United States during the time when Jane Doe 
was trying to take his depositon.  In fact, on February 16, 2010, counsel for Jane Doe 
took the deposition of Jeffrey Epstein’s house manager, Janusz Banaziak.  Mr. 
Banaziak was asked if he knew Mr. Brunel.  In summary, he responded that he knew 
him as Mr. Epstein’s friend.  He elaborated that Mr. Brunel had stayed with Epstein at 
Epstein’s Palm Beach home on at least two occasions in 2010.  The first 2010 visit was 
in January, when Mr. Brunel stayed for approximately 3 days.  Then Mr. Brunel stayed 
at Mr. Epstein’s home from approximately February 10th or 11th through February 14th,

2010.  It was known by Epstein that Brunel was coming to stay at the house in February 
2010, as he was picked up at the airport and driven to Epstein’s home by Epstein’s 
bodyguard, Igor Zinoview, and after his stay with Epstein, Brunel was driven from 
Epstein’s house to the airport by Sarah Kellen.  See deposition of Janusz Banaziak at 
page 154-161 and 168-16 attached hereto as Exhibit “A.” 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
 
As is readily apparent from the foregoing facts, Ms. Kudman has either made 
false representations about Mr. Brunel’s whereabouts or Mr. Brunel has made false 
representations about his whereabouts that she passed on.  In either case, they should 
be required to show cause why her and/or she should not be held in contempt of court 
for making false representations.  See, e.g., Acton v. Target Corp., 2009 WL 5214419 at 
*5 (W.D. Wash. 2009) (entering order to show cause why counsel should not be held in 
contempt for making false representations).  In particular, Mr. Brunel and Ms. Kudman 
should explain how it came to pass that Mr. Brunel was in Florida at the very time that 
Jane Doe was attempting to take his deposition while Ms. Kudman was confidently 
reporting that he was unavailable in France.  Given the known facts, Ms. Kudman was 
either an unwitting messenger who passed along false representations delivered to her 
by her client Mr. Brunel, or she was a knowing participant in Brunel and/or Epstein’s 
attempt to obstruct discovery; either way a show cause order should be entered and the 
appropriate person(s) sanctioned and held in contempt. 
 
Mr. Brunel and Ms. Kudman should also be required to provide a full explanation 
of who precisely is paying the attorney fees for Ms. Kudman’s services.  Most, if not all,

of the witnesses that have been deposed in this and related cases against Epstein have 
appeared with counsel retained and paid for by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein.  In this 
instance, we know that Mr. Epstein was together with his house guest, Mr. Brunel, at a 
time when Brunel’s counsel was representing that Brunel was out of the country and 
could thus not attend a deposition.  Mr. Epstein also knew at that time that the 
undersigned had been trying to coordinate Brunel’s deposition for months.  Therefore, 
there is no doubt that Mr. Epstein was assisting Mr. Brunel and/or Ms. Kudman in 
obstructing discovery.  At the very least, Mr. Epstein was an accomplice, but was he the 
person paying the attorney to make false representations and tamper with important 
witnesses?  While Mr. Epstein may be able to invoke his 5th amendment rights on such 
questions, Mr. Brunel and Ms. Kudman do not have that luxury, and at this point they 
should be required to provide these answers.   
 
Again, as the facts make clear, Ms. Kudman has not delivered on promises made 
(as an officer of the court) to counsel for Jane Doe, and Mr. Brunel has not appeared for 
a deposition.  As such, Jane Doe moves this Court to enter an order directing Mr. Brunel 
to promptly appear for a deposition in West Palm Beach within 14 days.  He was 
properly served with a subpoena by Jane Doe, and only through deceitful maneuvers he 
has been able to avoid his deposition.  This Court should not permit subpoenas to be 
avoided in this fashion.   
 
WHEREFORE, Jane Doe respectfully requests the Court to direct Mr. Brunel and 
Ms. Kudman to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for making false 
representations in an effort to avoid a deposition.  If the Court finds that they are in

contempt, the Court should also impose appropriate sanctions, including attorney’s fees 
for Jane Doe in connection with filing this motion.   The Court should also compel Mr. 
Brunel to appear for a deposition within 14 days of the Court’s order and grant any 
additional relief the Court deems just and proper.   
PRE-FILING CONFERENCE 
 
Counsel for Jane Doe has attempted to confer with Ms. Kudman about this 
motion, but she declined to make Brunel available for deposition, and in fact has again 
stated as recently as March 5, 2010 that Brunel has been out of the country since prior 
to the New Year with no plans to return.
