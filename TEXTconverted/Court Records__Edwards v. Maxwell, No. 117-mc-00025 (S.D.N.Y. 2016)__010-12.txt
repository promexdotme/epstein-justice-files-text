PROPOSED 
ORDER OF CONFIDENTIALITY ("PROTECTIVE ORDER") 
THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon the Intervenors 'Motion For a Protective 
Confidentiality Order and Incorporated Memorandum of Law. For the reasons that the Court 
will set forth in a separate forthcoming Order, the motion is hereby GRANTED. 
Now, therefore, it is ORDERED that: 
1. 
This Protective Order applies to all correspondence between the United States 
Attorney's Office and the Intervenors, including any attachments thereto, that was the subject 
of the Court's Order of June 18, 2013 (Doc. 188), hereinafter referred to as the "Confidential 
Discovery Material" or "COM." 
2. 
The parties shall designate the COM by marking them on the face of the

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 247-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/02/2014   Page 3 of 9
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-12     Filed 06/30/16     Page 4 of 10
CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO STIPULATION AND ORDER OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY. 
The marking shall be affixed in such a manner as not to obliterate or obscure any written 
matter. With respect to discovery materials produced electronically, the designation of 
Confidential may be made on the outside of the disk or ed. 
3. 
In the event that the Producing Party inadvertently fails to designate any CDM 
as confidential in this Action, it may make such designation subsequently by notifying all 
parties to whom such discovery material was produced, in writing as soon as practicable. 
After receipt of such notification, the parties to whom production has been made will treat 
the discovery material and all copies as having been designated as CDM. 
4. 
The parties agree that the CDM, or any summary thereof, shall be used solely 
for the purpose of this Action and for no other purpose without prior written approval from 
the Court or the prior written consent of the Producing Party and the Intervenors. All persons 
receiving or given access to CDM in accordance with the terms of this Protective Order 
consent to the continuing jurisdiction of this Court for the purposes of enforcing this 
Protective Order and remedying any violations thereof. 
5. a. CDM shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the following categories of 
persons: 
(i) The Court (and any appellate court), including court personnel.

such transcripts, with the consent of counsel.

but only to the extent necessary to perform their work in connection with this Action. 
(v) Any additional persons as counsel for the parties and Intervenors shall consent to 
in writing before the proposed disclosures. 
b. 
All parties and their respective counsel, paralegals and employees and 
assistants of all counsel receiving the COM shall take all steps reasonably necessary to 
prevent disclosure of the COM other than in accordance with the terms of this Protective 
Order. 
c. 
Disclosure of the COM other than in accordance with the terms of this 
Protective Order may subject the disclosing person to such sanctions and remedies as this 
Court may deem appropriate, including without limitation, contempt, injunctive relief and 
damages.

categories referred to in paragraph S.a. above, upon prior written consent of the Producing

apply to the Court for an order of relief, on notice to the Producing Party and Intervenors. 
8. 
Any person referred to in paragraphs S.a.iii through 5.a.v above who is 
furnished a copy of any COM shall first be given a copy of this Protective Order and required

10. 
No party shall be obligated to challenge the propriety of any designation, and 
a failure to do so shall not preclude a subsequent challenge on the propriety of such 
designation and shall not constitute an admission that any information is, in fact, confidential. 
11. 
In the event a party seeks to file any pleading, brief or memorandum or other 
document purporting to reproduce, paraphrase or summarize any CDM or portions thereof, 
that party shall take appropriate action to insure that the documents receive proper protection 
from public disclosure and shall seek leave of Court to file the document under seal in 
accordance with Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida. 
12. 
a. 
In the event that a party intends to file COM with the Court in support 
of, or in opposition to, a non-discovery motion (e.g. motion for summary judgment or any 
other dispositive or substantive motion), the filing party shall take appropriate action to 
insure that the documents receive proper protection from public disclosure and shall seek 
leave of Court to file the document under seal in accordance with the local rules. 
b. 
The non-discovery motion filing and briefing schedule shall be adjusted 
and tolled to provide sufficient time for the Court to consider and rule on the motion seeking 
permission to file the document(s) under seal. 
c. 
Once the matter has been resolved, the filing party may file the 
document(s) in accordance with the parties' and Intervenors' agreement and/or the Court's 
instructions, as applicable.

13. 
The CDM and/or other papers which are filed under seal shall be kept under 
seal until further order of the Court; however, said CDM and other papers filed under seal 
shall be available to the Court and counsel of record, and to all other persons entitled to 
receive the confidential information contained therein under the terms of this Protective 
Order. 
14. 
This Protective Order is intended to provide a mechanism for the handling of 
the CDM and is not intended to imply that any CDM is relevant or admissible in this Action 
or any other litigation. Any party may move for relief from, or general or particular 
modification of, the mechanism for maintaining confidentiality herein set forth, or the 
application of this Protective Order in any particular circumstance, and each party 
specifically reserves all rights to object to the relevance or admissibility of any information 
produced in accordance with this Protective Order on any grounds it may deem appropriate. 
15. 
If a party receiving CDM in accordance with the terms of this Protective Order 
is served with a subpoena or other process by any court, administrative or legislative body, 
or any other person or organization which calls for the production of any CDM, the party to 
whom the subpoena or other process is directed shall, within two business days of its service, 
notify the opposing party or parties and the Intervenors of the pendency of such subpoena or 
order and provide them with a copy of the subpoena or process and the date by which 
compliance is requested. Any party or the Intervenors opposing the production of the

information demanded in the subpoena or process shall notify the party served of its 
objections as early as possible prior to the requested compliance date. 
16. 
This Protective Order may be amended with leave of Court, by the agreement 
of counsel for the parties and Intervenors in the form of a stipulation submitted to the Court 
for approval, or by the Court sua sponte after affording the parties and Intervenors the 
opportunity to be heard. If the parties and Intervenors cannot agree to an amendment, then 
a formal motion to amend must be filed with the Court. This Protective Order is intended 
to regulate the handling of CDM and documents during this litigation, but shall remain in full 
force and effect until modified, superseded or terminated on the record by agreement of the 
parties thereto or by order of the Court. 
17. 
All counsel of record in this Action shall make a good faith effort to comply 
with the provisions of this Protective Order and to ensure that their agents, employees and 
clients do so as well. In the event of a change of counsel, retiring counsel shall notify new 
counsel of their responsibilities under this Order. 
18. 
This Protective Order does not restrict or limit the use ofCDM at any hearing 
or trial, which may be the subject of a further protective order and/or appropriate court 
orders. Prior to any hearing or trial at which the use of CDM is anticipated, the parties and 
Intervenors shall meet and confer regarding the use of the CDM. If the parties and 
Intervenors cannot agree, the parties and Intervenors shall request the Court to rule on such 
procedures. Notwithstanding, this Protective Order shall remain in full force and effect until

or by order of the Court.
