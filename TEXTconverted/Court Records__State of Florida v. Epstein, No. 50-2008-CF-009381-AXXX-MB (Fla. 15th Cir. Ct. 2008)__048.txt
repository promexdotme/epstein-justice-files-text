INTERVENOR PALM BEACH POST'S 
. MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS 
·····;·~ 
a> 
Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc., d/b/a The Palm Beach Post (the "Post") moves this Court 
for an award of attorneys? fees and costs in connection with this matter. In support thereof, the 
Post states: 
1. 
The Post is a daily newspaper that has covered this matter and related 
proceedings. In an effort to inform its readers concerning these matters, the Post relies upon 
( among other things) law enforcement records and judicial records. 
2. 
On June 10, 2009, the Court granted the Post's Motion to Intervene in this action 
for the purpose of seeking access to court records. Specifically, the Post sought access to a non-
prosecution agreement that was docketed on July 2, 2008, and an addendum docketed on August 
25, 2008. 
3. 
On June 25, 2009, the Court heard oral argument on the Post's (and other non-
parties') motions. The Court found that the documents has not properly been sealed in the first 
instance and further denied Defendant's Motion to Make Court Records Confidential dated June 
11, 2009. 
4. 
The Post is entitled to its fess and costs in this matter pursuant to Administrative 
Order Number 2.303 of this Court. Specifically, Rule 2.303 allows sanctions to be imposed

against the moving party "if a motion to seal is not made in good faith and is not supported by a 
sound legal and factual basis." Admin. Or. 15th Jud. Cir. Fla. 2.303. 
5. 
In this case, Mr. Epstein's Motion to Make Court Records Confidential was 
neither made in good faith nor supported by a sound legal and factual basis. Defendant's Motion 
asserted four interests that ostensibly would be protected by closure, but the motion cited no facts 
in support of that assertion. At the hearing on the motion, Defendant made no additional effort 
to demonstrate how and why the asserted interests would be served by closure. Instead, 
Defendant's arguments addressed extraneous, inapplicable issues that did not support closure and 
demonstrated the Defendant's lack of good faith in bringing his motion. In sum, the motion was 
wholly without merit, and the Post is entitled to an award of its fees and costs in defending its 
rights of access. 
WHEREFORE, the Post respectfully requests that this Court award to it its fees and costs 
in connection with this matter and grant such other relief as the Court deems proper.
