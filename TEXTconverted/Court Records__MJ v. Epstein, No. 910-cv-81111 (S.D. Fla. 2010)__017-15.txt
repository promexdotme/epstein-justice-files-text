EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND/OR REQUEST FOR ORDER 
OF CONFIDENTIALITY REGARDING THE PRODUCTION OF THE 
INFORMATION OUTLINED IN THE ORDERS AT DE 462 AND DE 572 AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, moves for a protective order and for the entry of an order of confidentiality 
relative to the information ordered to be produced pursuant to DE 462 and 572, and states: 
1. 
On February 4, 2010, this Court entered an order (DE 462) requiring that Epstein 
produce his tax returns, passport and certain information provided to him by the federal 
government during certain criminal proceedings 
2. 
After Motions for Reconsideration and Rule 4 Appeal/Responses were fully 
briefed, this court entered its order at DE 572 requiring that Jeffrey Epstein produce his tax 
returns, his passport and the information the federal government gave to Epstein's lawyers 
during said criminal proceedings. See DEs 462 and 572. The Order requires that Epstein, 

Case 9:08-cv-80893-KAM   Document 170    Entered on FLSD Docket 06/28/2010   Page 2 of 4
Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 17-15   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 2 of 4
through his counsel, comply within 3 days (i.e., by June 30, 2010). As such, this motion must be 
respectfully addressed before June 30, 2010. 
3. 
As part of that order at DE 572, this court ruled that " ... Plaintiff shall not disclose 
Defendant's tax returns to any third parties without Defendant's consent and/or further court 
order. .. [and] Plaintiff may disclose this information to an expert witness retained to testify at 
trial, but only on condition that the expert will agree to retain the confidentiality of the 
information and not disclose it to any third parties without the agreement of defendant or further 
order of the Court." The order went on to state that it " ... is without prejudice to any future 
motion by defendant to exclude any of the information produced pursuant to this order at trial." 
4. 
As to the information given to Epstein's lawyers by the federal government as 
outlined in DE 462, the court did not address in DE 572 any order of confidentiality. 
5. 
As a result of the foregoing, and consistent with DE 572 related to tax returns and 
passport, Epstein hereby requests that this court enter an order: 
a. limiting Mr. Edwards and Jane Doe's use of the information given to Epstein's 
lawyers by the federal government only to this litigation; 
b. ordering that the information not be disclosed to any third parties without the 
consent of the Defendant or further order of this court, which includes news and 
television media; 
c. requiring, as it did relative to the tax returns and the passport, that any expert that 
receives the information given to Epstein's lawyers by the federal government 
must be one retained to testify at trial and shall only receive said information on 
condition that the expert will agree to retain the confidentiality of the information

and not disclose it to any third parties without the agreement of defendant or 
further order of the Court; 
d. that the information given to Epstein's lawyers by the federal government be 
returned to Epstein's lawyers at the conclusion of this trial; 
e. that failure to follow the court's directives set forth in said order shall result in 
contempt of court; and 
f. 
for such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, requests the Court enter a protective 
order and confidentiality order incorporating the terms set forth in paragraph 5a-f and grant any 
additional relief the Court deems just and proper.
