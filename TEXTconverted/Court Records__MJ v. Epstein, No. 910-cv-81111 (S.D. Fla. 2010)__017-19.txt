PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S EMERGENCY MOTION TO HAVE EPSTEIN HELD IN 
CONTEMPT FOR FAILING TO PRODUCE STATE DISCOVERY AND 
CORRESPONDENCE AND FOR PRODUCING ONLY REDACTED CORRESPONDENCE 
WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE AND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS  
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, through undersigned counsel, hereby files this motion to have defendant 
Epstein held in contempt for (1) failing to produce any state criminal discovery and any 
correspondence with state prosecutors, and (2) producing only redacted correspondence with the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office.  Both of these failures stand in clear violation of this Court’s discovery orders.  Jane 
Doe further asks that Epstein be directed to produce these materials forthwith and that the Court 
impose appropriate sanctions.  Jane Doe respectfully asks that this motion be decided rapidly. 
 
As the Court is well aware, there has now been more than eleven months of litigation on 
whether defendant was going to produce any discovery to Jane Doe.  More than a year ago, Jane Doe 
propounded three discovery requests: 
Request No. 7:  All discovery information obtained by you or your attorneys as a result 
of the exchange of discovery in the State criminal case against you or the Federal 
investigation against you.

Request No. 9:  Any documents or other evidentiary materials provided to local, state, 
or federal law enforcement investigators or local, state or federal prosecutors 
investigating your sexual activities with minors. 
 
Request No. 10:  All correspondence between you and your attorneys and state or 
federal law enforcement or prosecutors (includes, but not limited to, letters to and from 
the States Attorney’s office or any agents thereof). 
 
 
After innumerable motions and continuances and delays, this Court’s order to produce these 
items came due yesterday.  Jane Doe finally received her discovery last night.  Remarkably, however, 
Epstein deliberately limited his discovery in two ways.   
 
First, while Requests No. 7, 9, and 10 clearly cover discovery information that Epstein obtained 
in both federal and state proceedings, Epstein produced only federal discovery (or, more precisely, 
because he claims to have received no federal discovery, he provided nothing at all).  In addition, while 
Request No. 10 clearly covers correspondence with both federal and state prosecutors, Epstein has 
produced only correspondence with federal prosecutors.  There is no basis for limiting production to 
federal materials.   
 
Second, while Request No. 10 clearly covers correspondence both to and from Epstein’s 
criminal defense attorneys, Epstein has redacted all of this correspondence so that only correspondence 
to him is revealed.  The resulting mishmash of redactions means that much of the correspondence – 
and virtually all of the correspondence most useful to Jane Doe – has been withheld by Epstein.  
 
These deliberate violations of the Court’s orders are part of a persistent pattern by Epstein to 
thwart legitimate discovery by Jane Doe.1  Accordingly, the Court should order production of these 
items forthwith.  Jane Doe seeks production on an emergency basis because she has been compelled to 
attend a second settlement conference on July 6, 2010, at 9:30 a.m., and these items of discovery might

Use of 5th Amendment and Memorandum of Law, case no. 9:08-cv-80893, doc. #178 (Epstein’s filibustering

put her in a much better position to understand the strength of her case at that time.  Jane Doe therefore 
respectfully requests that the Court rule on this motion rapidly by Friday, July 2, 2010.  (Monday, July 
5, 2010, is a federal holiday.)  Jane Doe also seeks appropriate sanctions.  
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
For the convenience of the Court, here is the full saga of several straightforward discovery 
requests that Jane Doe has filed in this case.  On July 20, 2009, Jane Doe filed a motion to compel 
production of various previously-requested documents, including discovery provided to Epstein by 
state and federal prosecutors in the criminal cases against him and correspondence between his 
criminal defense attorneys and state and federal prosecutors during the criminal investigation.  Case 
No. 9:08-cv-80119, doc. #210.  Specifically, her motion sought production of the following: 
Request No. 7:  All discovery information obtained by you or your attorneys as a result 
of the exchange of discovery in the State criminal case against you or the Federal 
investigation against you. 
 
Request No. 9:  Any documents or other evidentiary materials provided to local, state, 
or federal law enforcement investigators or local, state or federal prosecutors 
investigating your sexual activities with minors. 
 
Request No. 10:  All correspondence between you and your attorneys and state or 
federal law enforcement or prosecutors (includes, but not limited to, letters to and from 
the States Attorney’s office or any agents thereof). 
 
(doc. #210 at pp. 10-12 (emphases added)).  Epstein obtained an extension of time in which to respond 
and, two-and-a-half months later, on October 6, 2009, Epstein filed an objection to producing these 
items primarily on Fifth Amendment grounds (doc. #339).  On October 16, 2009, Jane Doe promptly 
filed a reply in support of her motion (doc. #354).  On January 22, 2010, Jane Doe filed a notice that 
more than 90 days had elapsed since the filing of her motion (doc. #453).   
 
On February 4, 2010, the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part Jane Doe’s motion 
to compel, specifically ruling that Epstein had to produce the discovery provided to him by state and

federal prosecutors and the requested correspondence, rejecting Fifth Amendment and other objections 
raised by Epstein.  (case no. 9:08-cv-80119, doc. #462).  The magistrate judge specifically granted 
requests 7, 9, and 10.  Id. at 10 (“Accordingly, Epstein is ordered to produce the documents subjects to 
these Requests [i.e., requests 7, 9, and 10] within ten (10) days from the date hereof.”).   
 
Epstein then filed for an extension of time in which to appeal (doc. #464), which Jane Doe 
opposed on grounds of delay (doc. #465).  On February 11, 2010, the Court granted in part and denied 
in part the extension of time, specifically warning Epstein that “[i]n the event that Magistrate Judge 
Johnson’s February 4, 2010 Order is affirmed on appeal, Defendant will have three (3) business days 
from the date of this Court’s order to produce the documents at issue.”   (doc. #468).  Epstein then 
ultimately filed his appeal/motion for reconsideration of the magistrate decision on February 26, 2010. 
(doc. #477).   On March 10, 2010, Jane Doe then filed her response in Opposition to Defendant’s 
Motion for reconsideration. (doc. #. 485).   
 
On April 1, 2010, the magistrate judge rejected Epstein’s challenge, reaffirming his earlier 
order that “compelled production from state and federal prosecutors in the criminal case against him.”  
(doc. #513). 
 
On May 6, 2010, the court held a status conference on the appeal (which also involved other 
consolidated cases raising similar appeals and issues).  The Court asked the parties to attempt to reach 
a resolution of issues surrounding Epstein’s net worth. 
 
On May 12, 2010, Epstein filed a “Consolidated” Rule 4 Review and Appeal of Portions of the 
Magistrate Judge’s orders (doc. #545).  On May 27, 2010, Jane Doe filed a “protective” response to the 
consolidated reply, noting that she had previously responded to all of the arguments raised by the 
appeal and that the “consolidated” appeal did not require any new response from her (doc. #551).  The 
response also noted Jane Doe and Epstein had been unable to resolve disputed net worth issues.

On Friday, June 25, 2010, this Court entered an order affirming the magistrate judge’s 
discovery orders in all respects (Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, doc. #572) and, as it previously 
warned Epstein, requiring Epstein to produce the discovery materials within three business days.    
 
At this point, despite having had a year to assemble the requested discovery items and prepare 
for their production – and more than four months since this Court’s warning to be prepared to produce 
the documents on three days notice – Epstein began filing motions to restrict production.  On Monday 
evening, June 28, 2010, at approximately 5:11 p.m., Epstein filed a motion for a protective order 
regarding dissemination of the materials (Case No. 9:09-cv-80893, doc. #170). On Tuesday morning, 
June 29, 2010, at approximately 9:31 a.m., this Court summarily denied the motion (doc. #172).  Then, 
as the deadline for production drew even nearer, on Wednesday, June 30, 2010, at approximately 2:19 
p.m., Epstein filed a motion for a right to redact tax returns that were being produced and informed the 
Court in his Motion that he was going to go ahead and only produce redacted tax returns (doc. #182).  
Shortly thereafter, Epstein began transmitting redacted returns to Jane Doe’s counsel via email.  Acting 
with impressive speed, at approximately 2:33 p.m., the Court summarily denied Epstein’s motion (doc. 
#183).   
 
Following these actions by the Court, yesterday defendant Epstein made his production of 
unredacted tax returns electronically to Jane Doe’s counsel.  However, Epstein remarkably still failed 
to produce materials he was required to produce in two critical ways.  First, Epstein did not produce 
any information he had obtained from the state during discovery of the criminal investigation against 
him.  Indeed, because he had not (apparently in his view) obtained any federal discovery during the 
criminal investigation, he turned over nothing at all responsive to Jane Doe’s Requests No. 7 and No. 
9.   And similarly, with regard to correspondence from the prosecutors, Epstein also produced only 
correspondence with federal prosecutors – not with state prosecutors. Of course, this significantly

limited the production he made, as Epstein pled guilty to state sex charges rather than federal sex 
charges – leaving Jane Doe with no correspondence or discovery from the State. 
 
Second, with regard to his correspondence with federal prosecutors that he did produce, Epstein 
redacted anything coming from attorneys, leaving only the responses from the federal prosecutors.  
The result is an often unintelligible mishmash of back-and-forth emails, where only half of what is 
being said is disclosed.  It forces Jane Doe to read everything out of context and severely limits the 
utility of what was produced.  To give but two of what are literally dozens of examples of the 
unintelligibility, consider these e-mail chains – or, more precisely, half e-mail chains:

Exhibit 2, found as Correspondence 3 from defense counsel (June 30, 2010).   
 
The net result of these redactions, of course, is that what is produced is of essentially no value 
to Jane Doe for discovery or at trial – what is left is merely statements from prosecutors, rather than 
statements from agents of Mr. Epstein that could be used to help build Jane Doe’s case.

of the exchange of discovery in the State criminal case against you or the Federal investigation against 
you” (emphasis added)).  In addition, Request No. 10 plainly requested “[a]ll correspondence between 
you and your attorneys and state or federal law enforcement or prosecutors (including, but not limited 
to, letters to and from the States Attorney’s office or any agents thereof (emphasis added)).”  Indeed, 
given the intertwined nature of these two investigations (with a federal non-prosecution agreement 
ultimately resulting when Epstein pled guilty to state sex charges), it would be difficult to segregate 
the two.  Of course, Jane Doe would want discovery and correspondence from both cases – it makes no 
difference to her the source of the documents or correspondence. And the legal principles governing 
production would not vary between federal and state investigations.   
 
Astonishingly then, Epstein now after 11 months of litigation has decided that Jane Doe’s 
request – and the magistrate judge’s order affirming that request – are somehow to be limited to merely 
the federal criminal investigation.  And, with amazing convenience for Epstein, since he apparently 
deems all the discovery his criminal defense team received to be purely state discovery, he has to 
produce nothing on  request for production nos. 7 and 9, and only half of what would be expected for 
request for production no. 10. 
 
In the context of this case, it should be readily apparent to the Court that Epstein has 
deliberately decided to produce substantially less information than he is required to produce.  He is 
doing so by taking a ridiculous and absurd position that is not supported by any reasonable reading of 
the discovery requests or this Court’s rulings.  And he is doing so in a civil case, where discovery is 
supposed to be freely and readily exchanged.   
 
 
The only even arguable basis for Epstein’s deliberate intransigence is that he is apparently 
taking the position that a single sentence in one of Jane Doe’s many pleadings on these issues should 
be deemed to have “narrowed” the plain language of her clear Requests for Production.  In a reply brief

in October 2009, counsel for Jane Doe in briefly described the nature of requests for production nos. 7, 
9, and 10, writing one sentence that referred to the requests as covering materials from the federal 
government.  See Plaintiff’s Jane Doe’s Reply to Response to Motion to Compel, doc. #354 at 3 
(referring to requests as seeking “information that the federal government gave to Epstein in the course 
of its plea discussions with him”).  In reviewing that single sentence, it should have been obvious that 
Jane Doe was not suddenly – and for no apparent reason – narrowing her request to half of the material 
that she would otherwise have been entitled to receive.   At the very most (and this is debatable), it 
appears that one could argue that Jane Doe’s counsel spoke loosely or made a typographical error, as 
the sentence could have more clearly said “federal and state government.”  Whatever can be said of 
this single sentence, the remaining sentences in this pleading immediately following this sentence 
plainly refer to both the federal and state governments, as there is no limitation to the federal 
government in approximately nine other sentences in close proximity to the sentence Epstein 
apparently seizes upon.  See, e.g.,id. at 4 (“The government itself gave Epstein the documents!” 
(emphasis in original)); id. at 6 “the government was showing him the documents in the first place to 
convince him to plead guilty to a crime” (emphasis added)); id. at 9 (“Jane Doe’s requests for 
production number 7 and 9, which seek respectively discovery provided by the government and 
“evidentiary materials’ provided by the government” (emphasis added)).  And, eliminating any 
legitimate confusion, at the end of this section in this brief, Jane Doe explained quite clearly that she 
was seeking not only correspondence with the U.S. Attorney’s Office but more general with 
“government agencies,”   -- i.e., both federal and state agencies.  Id. at 10. 
 
Regardless of how Epstein might have intentionally misconstrued this single sentence in the 
Jane Doe’s reply, the magistrate judge ultimately ruled on the actual request for production.  The 
magistrate judge in using a shorthand to describing the nature of the Requests for Production, also

referred at one point to “the federal government” and at another point to “the government.”  Compare 
case no. 9:08-CV-80893, doc. 462 at 8 (describing Requests 7, 9 and 10 as involving “documents the 
federal government gave to Epstein”) with id. (describing requests as “documents the government itself 
gave to Epstein”).  But the Court’s ultimate order was that the Request for Productions 7, 9, and 10 
was granted.  Id. Nothing in the context of the magistrate judge’s decision indicated any principle of 
law that would make federal information and correspondence discoverable and state information and 
correspondence non-discoverable. Indeed, the magistrate judge made clear on the next page of the 
order that he understood he was reviewing a discovery matter relating to documents involving 
“Epstein’s Florida guilty” plea and “federal or state criminal investigations.”  Id. at 9 (emphases 
added).  Nor would there have been any logical reason for the magistrate judge to have awarded to 
Jane Doe production of only half of the materials she sought (i.e., awarded her only production of 
federal materials, but not state materials on the same subject).   
 
Following the magistrate judge’s ruling, Epstein filed a motion to reconsider.  If Epstein 
believed that the order only obligated him to produce federal discovery materials/correspondence and 
that he had no such materials – it would have been a simple matter for him to have simply said that and 
not appeal the ruling on Requests Nos. 7 and 9 (and to a large extent 10).  To the contrary, however, 
Epstein spent nine pages asking the magistrate judge to reverse its rulings on these three requests for 
production.  (Case No. 9:08-cv- 80119-KAM, doc. #477, at 3-11).  Epstein also stated that he did not 
have discovery information or evidentiary information provided to him by the federal government.  Id. 
at 4. 
 
In response, Jane Doe noted Epstein’s glass-is-half-empty representations that he had no 
federal discovery materials and objected to his “semantic games.”  Plaintiff Jane Doe’s Response to

KAM, doc. #485, at 3.   She made clear that she expected Epstein to honor the Request for Productions 
as they were written and produce both federal and state materials: 
Jane Doe does not take these representations to mean that Epstein possesses no 
information responsive to these requests.  If this were the case, Epstein could have 
avoided seven months of litigation by simply making this representation to the Court at 
the outset.  Rather, Epstein seems to be playing semantic games.  With regard to 
discovery request no. 7, Epstein represents only that he has no discovery information 
from the federal government – not contesting the obvious fact (as Jane Doe has been 
reliably informed) that he received significant discovery in connection with the state 
criminal charges to which he pled guilty.  With regard to discovery request no. 9, 
Epstein represents only that he has not been given evidentiary documents by the federal 
government – again not contest the obvious fact (as Jane Doe has been reliably 
informed) that he received documents from both the state and federal authorities 
working on his case.  If Epstein is going to continue to mince words in this fashion, 
Jane Doe asks that he clearly explain to the Court in any reply pleading that he may file 
what materials responsive to the requests for production he has so that the Court may 
make an informed ruling. 
 
Id. (emphases in original).  Jane Doe also noted specifically that request no. 10 “covers correspondence 
with ‘state or federal law enforcement or prosecutors.’  For convenience, the request will be described 
as being for correspondence with ‘the Government.’”  Id.  at 5 n.2. 
 
In his reply to Jane Doe’s response, Epstein cited the single sentence in Jane Doe’s October 
pleading discussed above and made an argument that the magistrate judge had somehow impliedly 
adopted it as narrowing the scope of the her requests.  Defendant’s Reply to Plaintiff’s Response to 
Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration, Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, doc. #502, at 2-3.  Epstein 
then went on to spend seven pages arguing on the merits that he should not be required to produce state 
discovery materials.  He made two detailed arguments against producing state discovery materials.  He 
first argued that the request for state materials was somehow “improper” because Jane Doe’s counsel 
had received some materials from state prosecutors.  Id. at 3-5.2  Epstein then argued that the state 
materials were “work product” because his attorney had picked out certain materials from the state 
                                                 
2 To be clear, Jane Doe’s counsel believes that Epstein possesses significant state discovery materials that have 
never been seen by Jane Doe.

prosecutor.  In support of this argument, Epstein for the first time attached an affidavit from Jack 
Goldberger, his criminal defense attorney, about the process of obtaining the state discovery materials.  
Id. at 5-7.   
 
As has been the case with many other claims presented by the Epstein in the course of this 
litigation, the magistrate judge was not impressed with these arguments against producing both federal 
and state discovery materials.  In the final order on the subject on April 1, 2010, the magistrate judge 
explained: “Epstein takes issue with that portion of the Order which compelled production of discovery 
from state and federal prosecutors in the criminal case against him, his recent tax returns, and his 
passport.  The Court stands behind each of these decisions for the reasons stated in its Order and is not 
persuaded by any of Epstein’s arguments to the contrary.”  Omnibus Order, Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-
KAM, doc. #513 at 2 (emphases added).  Notably, the magistrate judge was not persuaded by “any” of 
Epstein’s arguments – including, of course, his argument that the single sentence in Jane Doe’s earlier 
pleading has magically “narrowed” the plain meaning of her requests.  And notably, the magistrate 
judge himself – in the face of a challenge from Epstein that the court order only required Epstein to 
produce federal materials – specifically described the order as including  “production of discovery 
from state and federal prosecutors.”   
 
After various further delays engineered by Epstein as recounted above, pleadings were filed 
before this Court (Marra, J.), on the appeal of the magistrate judge’s ruling.   Epstein’s pleadings were 
essentially “cut and paste” pleadings from his pleading with the magistrate judge.  Most important for 
present purposes, the pleadings revealed no doubt that Epstein understood that Jane Doe was 
requesting – and that the the magistrate judge had ordered -- production of both federal and state 
materials.  See, e.g., doc. #545 at 5 (discussing breadth of Jane Doe’s request), at 15 (challenging 
obligation to produce materials from state and local police agencies); at 17 (arguing that materials in

“Palm Beach state Attorney’s File” were somehow work product material).  And on June 25, 2010, this 
Court affirmed all of the magistrate judge’s discovery rulings.  (Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, doc. 
#572). 
Jane Doe has reviewed these pleadings in detail because they point to only one conclusion: 
defendant Epstein is deliberately violating the clear order of Magistrate Judge Johnson that he produce 
“discovery from state and federal prosecutors in the criminal case against him”  Indeed, Epstein has 
specifically presented his extraordinary and crabbed interpretation of the order (i.e., that it only extends 
to the federal government materials) to the magistrate judge, and the magistrate judge told him the 
interpretation was rejected.  And this Court affirmed.  Epstein is therefore plainly in contempt of this 
Court’s order.  He should be directed to immediately produce the discovery and other information he 
received from state prosecutions and correspondence with state prosecution and be subject to other 
sanctions as explained below. 
II. 
EPSTEIN SHOULD BE HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR FAILING TO PRODUCE 
 
UNREDACTED CORRESPONDENCE WITH FEDERAL PROSECUTORS 
 
 
Defendant Epstein, making use of yet another dilatory tactic, has also deliberately violated this 
Court’s discovery order by failing to produce unredacted correspondence with federal prosecutors.  
Instead, he has produced redacted discovery that is essentially gibberish and, in any event, unusable by 
Jane Doe because it contains no statements from Epstein or his representatives and forces Jane Doe to 
read all communications about Epstein’s crimes against minors out of context.   
 
Epstein apparently takes the position that he is somehow entitled to redact the correspondence, 
even though none of the underlying magistrate judge orders regarding the correspondence even 
mention redaction and even though Epstein has never even raised redaction.  Perhaps Epstein was 
thinking about filing a motion for authorizing redaction – only to be scared off by this Court’s 14-
minute turnaround time yesterday in rejecting his frivolous motion to redact the tax returns he was

producing.  (Case No. 9:08-cv-80893-KAM, doc. #183).  In light of these circumstances, it appears 
that Epstein’s legal counsel have calculated that it is better to force Jane Doe’s attorney to file a motion 
objecting to redaction rather than to present this preposterous idea to the Court for summary rejection. 
 
The redaction is in clear defiance of the orders in this case.   Jane Doe’s Request for Production 
No. 10 plainly and broadly requested “[a]ll correspondence between you and your attorneys and state 
or federal law enforcement or prosecutors (includes, but not limited to, letters to and from the States 
Attorney’s office or any agents thereof).”  (Case No. 9:08-cv-80119, doc. #210 at 10).  The magistrate 
judge rejected Epstein’s arguments against production.  (doc. #462 at 10).   The magistrate judge 
“rejected out of hand” any claim that the correspondence was somehow protected by the attorney-
client privilege or work-product doctrine, noting that the correspondence with state and federal 
prosecutors could hardly be regarded as somehow “confidential.”  Id. at 9.  The magistrate judge 
therefore ordered Epstein to comply with Request for Production No. 10 “involving settlement 
discussions and plea negotiations.”  Id. at 10. 
 
Once again, defendant Epstein filed for reconsideration, making it quite clear that the Request 
for Production covered not only what prosecutors were saying to his representatives, but also what his 
representatives were saying back.  Thus, Epstein asked the magistrate judge to reconsider not only 
because it was purportedly protected by the attorney-client privilege, but also for a new reason: 
settlement discussion confidentially.  Epstein argued that because “[t]he requested communications 
include the views of Epstein’s counsel in the criminal case regarding why a federal prosecution was 
inappropriate . . . . It also includes Epstein’s counsel’s views on the limits and inapplicability of certain 
elements of 18 U.S.C. § 2255 . . . .This opinion work product should not be disclosed . . . .”  
Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration and/or Request for Rule 4 Review, Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-

that the request is now limited to communications form the Government to Epstein, see DE 54, pgs 3 
and 8, the narrowed request implicate[s] the same concerns for the opinions, the work product, and the 
expectations of the privacy of the United States Attorney . . . .”  Id. at 8.   
 
Jane Doe responded by explaining “[t]here is nothing confidential about materials being 
exchanged between Epstein and government prosecutors – regardless of whether the materials or 
correspondence were being sent from the prosecutors to Epstein or from Epstein to the prosecutors.”  
Plaintiff Jane Doe’s Response to Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration, doc. #485 at 13 (emphasis 
added).  Jane Doe also objected that Epstein was improperly raising arguments concerning settlement 
confidentiality for the first time on reconsideration.  Id. at 5-6.  Jane Doe went on to note the “cryptic 
sentence” in Epstein’s pleading, and explained: “It’s hard to understand what Epstein means by this 
sentence.  The cited docket entry – DE 543 – has nothing to do with the discovery request at hand.  
Perhaps this sentence is simply a mistaken remnant of a botched ‘cut and paste’ from another pleading 
in another case where docket entry 564 would relevant.  In any event, to be clear, Jane Doe has not 
‘narrowed’ her request to only one-half of the relevant correspondence and thus the magistrate judge’s 
order is not limited to one-half of the correspondence.” Id. at 13 n.4.  Epstein did not press the point in 
his reply brief.  (doc. #502 at 1-3 (not raising this issue)). 
 
The magistrate judge – once again – rejected all of Epstein’s arguments, reaffirming that 
Epstein was obligated to comply with Request for Production No. 10.  The Court singled out Epstein’s 
argument about settlement confidentiality as specifically flawed: “Epstein’s final argument, raised now 
for the first time, concerns settlement discussion confidentiality.  Because Epstein never presented this 
argument to the undersigned it is inappropriate to raise it now for the first time. . . . Even were the

Court to consider the argument on its merits, for the reasons explained in Jane Doe’s Response 
Memorandum (D.E. #485), pp. 4-9, the Court finds said argument without merit.”  Omnibus Order, 
Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, doc. #513, at 2-3.   
 
As noted above, after various further delays engineered by Epstein, pleadings were filed before 
this Court (Marra, J.), on the appeal of the magistrate judge’s ruling.   Here again, Epstein’s pleadings 
make it crystal clear that he knew he was obligated to produce not only what prosecutors said to him, 
but what he and his representatives said to them. He objected to producing correspondence involving  
“the opinion of each counsel, Epstein’s and the United States Attorney’s[,] [which] were exchanged 
with each other pursuant to the overall expectation that they were safeguarded from disclosure by the 
policies of confidentiality that protect communications during settlement and plea negotiations.  The 
requested communications include the views of Epstein’s counsel in the criminal cases regarding why 
federal prosecution was inappropriate [and other subjects].”  (Case No. 9:08-cv-80119, doc. #545 at 
11 (emphasis added)).   And on June 25, 2010, this Court rejected all of Epstein’s arguments and 
affirmed all of the magistrate judge’s discovery rulings.  (Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, doc. #572). 
 
Once again, it is quite clear that Epstein stands in clear and deliberate defiance of this Court’s 
discovery order obligating him to produce correspondence as directed in Request for Production No. 
10.  Epstein should be directed to produce the discovery and other information he received from state 
prosecutions and correspondence with state prosecution forthwith and be subject to other sanctions as 
explained below.

Jane Doe’s counsel apologizes for forcing this Court to read this entire discovery saga.  But the 
bottom line remains that after eleven months of litigation, when Jane Doe was receiving her first

discovery production from Epstein yesterday, he clearly and deliberately defied this Court’s orders 
about the scope of that production.  Moreover, as the events recounted above make clear, the refusal to 
produce is willful.  They also seemed to be calculated to force Jane Doe’s legal counsel to spend a 
significant amount of time writing a pleading to obtain production, just when she has been ordered (at 
Epstein’s demand) to another settlement conference and while preparing for trial in this matter.4  
Indeed, it seems probable that Epstein is seeking to prevent Jane Doe from having these materials to 
review before the settlement conference – and perhaps to block her from having these materials when 
her trial starts in less than three weeks.  
 
It is hard to view Epstein’s maneuvers – and Epstein’s recent attempts to restrict discovery that 
this Court has summarily rejected – as anything other than a signal that Epstein and his legal counsel 
believe that they need not follow the rules that apply to other litigants.  Perhaps the vast wealth of the 
defendant and the legal fees that he is paying his attorneys has engendered this attitude.  Regardless of 
the reason, this Court should not tolerate such clear intransigence and impose appropriate sanctions.   
 
Epstein should be found to be in contempt of court.  To find contempt, “the Court must 
determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that (1) the allegedly violated order was 
valid and lawful; (2) the order was clear, definite and unambiguous; and (3) the alleged violator had 
the ability to comply with the order.”  Brauchle v. Southern Sports Grill, Inc., 2008 WL 4753707, at *1 
(S.D.Fla.,2008) (citing McGregor v. Chierico, 206 F.3d 1378, 1383 (11th Cir. 2000)). For the reasons 
described in detail above, the discovery orders at issue here were clearly valid, unambiguous about 
their breadth, and Epstein plainly had the ability to comply.  Indeed, given all the circumstances 
recounted here, it is clear that Epstein made a deliberate choice not to comply.  The Court accordingly 
                                                 
4 Judge Palermo has ordered Jane Doe to prepare a confidential settlement statement and file it by 5 p.m. today 
as part of that conference.  Jane Doe’s completion of that statement has been interrupted by the need to file this 
motion.

should use the full panoply of powers that it possesses to punish this blatant contempt.  The Court also 
has additional powers under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to deter discovery 
abuses.   
 
Jane Doe respectfully requests the Court impose the following sanctions:   
 
First, Epstein should be required to produce forthwith all discovery information, documents, 
and other evidentiary materials covered by Requests No. 7, 9, and 10 – e.g.., all discovery and 
evidentiary information from both the federal and state prosecuting and investigating authorities and 
all correspondence – in unredacted form – both from and to federal and state prosecuting and 
investigating authorities.5  Jane Doe respectfully requests that the Court rule on this motion before her 
mandated settlement conference, so that she can have the benefit of those materials at that time.   
 
Second, Epstein’s counsel should be required to pay $5,000 to the Court and instructed not to 
play any further games as this case moves to trial. 
 
Third, Epstein should be deemed to have waived any objection to the use by Jane Doe at trial of 
any of the materials subject to the discovery demands at issue here (Requests for Production Nol. 7, 9, 
and 10).  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(i) (allowing the Court to award as a sanction for discovery 
violation “prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or 
defenses”).

Jane Doe’s counsel understands Epstein to object to this motion.

CONCLUSION 
 
The Court should find that Epstein has deliberately violated its discovery orders, hold him in 
contempt of court, direct that the requested discovery be produced forthwith, and impose appropriate 
sanctions as described above.
