CLERK OF THE COURT 
IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS 
DIVISION OF ST. THOMAS AND ST. JOHN 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
ESTA TE OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, DARREN 
K. INDYKE, in his capacity as EXECUTOR OF 
THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, 
RICHARD

EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E.

CIVIL CASE NO.: ST-20-CV-155 
JOINT MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS 
Plaintiff GHISLAINE MAXWELL ("Plaintiff"), and Defendants DARREN K. INDYKE 
("Indyke") and RICHARD D. KAHN ("Kahn"), by and though their undersigned counsel, in their 
capacity as Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"), and on behalf of the 
Estate and NES, LLC, an entity administered in probate by the Co-Executors as part of the Estate 
(collectively, the "Defendants"), through their respective undersigned attorneys, hereby file this 
Joint Motion to Stay Proceedings until September 7, 2020, and state as follows: 
1. 
"The power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to 
control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for 
counsel, and for litigants." Burke v. Treasure Bay V.I. Corp., 2016 WL 9503682, at *3 (V.I. Super. 
Oct. 6, 2016) (citing Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254- 55 (1936)). Generally, the 
party seeking a stay "must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go

forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to 
someone else." Landis, 299 U.S. at 254. To that end, in determining whether to grant a motion to 
stay, courts have considered the following factors: (1) whether a stay will simplify issues and 
promote judicial economy; (2) the balance of hmm to the parties; and (3) the length of the requested 
stay. See Burke, 2016 WL 9503682, at *3; Cheyney State Coll. Faculty v. Hufstedler, 703 F.2d 732, 
737-38 (3d Cir. 1983) (citing Landis, 299 U.S. at 254-55). 
2. 
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case on May 1, 2020, citing, in part, 15 
V.I.C. § 606(a), which provides that "[a]n action may be commenced against an executor or 
administrator at any time after the expiration of twelve months from the granting of letters 
testamentary or of administration and until the final settlement of the estate and discharge of such 
executor or administrator from the trust, and not otherwise." Here, Magistrate Judge Carolyn P. 
Hennon-Percell issued Letters Testamentary to Indyke and Kahn on September 6, 2019. 
3. 
Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy and preserving assets of the Estate, it is 
requested that the Court stay the instant proceeding until September 7, 2020, a definite period of 98 
days from the date of this Motion. The parties further stipulate that Plaintiffs response to 
Defendant's motion to dismiss shall be due on or by September 7, 2020. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and Defendants respectfully request that this Court enter an Order 
staying this proceeding until September 7, 2020, and for any such other and further relief that this 
Court deems just and proper.
