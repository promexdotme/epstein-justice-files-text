Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, in the above-referenced actions.  With Plaintiffs’ consent, we write 
pursuant to Your Honor’s June 22, 2020 Order to provide the Court with a joint status report.   
Plaintiffs’ counsel has advised us that all Plaintiffs are currently working to formally submit 
their claims to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program.  Accordingly, the parties request that 
the stays entered in these actions continue in accordance with the respective stay orders.  
Respectfully submitted, 
/s/ Bennet J. Moskowitz
