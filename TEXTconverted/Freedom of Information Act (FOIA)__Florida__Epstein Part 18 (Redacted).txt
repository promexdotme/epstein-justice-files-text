How You Are In Love 
You take a while to fall in love with someone. Tnist takes time. 
You tend to give more than take in relationships. 
You need your space and privacy. You don't like to be smothered. 
You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them 
change. 
You stay in love for a long time. even if you aren't loved back. When 
you fall, you fall hard.

Brand name: 
Xanax 
Pronounced: ZAN-ax 
Generic name: Alprazolam 
Other brand name: Xanax XR 
Why is Xanax prescribed? 
Xanax is a tranquilizer used in the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or the treatment 
of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorder is marked by unrealistic worry or excessive fears and 
concerns. Anxiety associated with depression is also responsive to Xanax. 
Xanax and the extended-release formulation, Xanax XR, are also used in the treatment of 
panic disorder, which appears as unexpected panic attacks and may be accompanied by a 
fear of open or public places called agoraphobia. Only your doctor can diagnose panic disorder 
and best advise you about treatment. 
Some doctors prescribe Xanax to treat alcohol withdrawal, fear of open spaces and strangers, 
depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and premenstrual syndrome. 
Most important fact about Xanax 
Tolerance and dependence can occur with the use of Xanax. You may experience withdrawal 
symptoms if you suddenly stop using the drug or reduce the dosage too quickly. Withdrawal 
symptoms are listed under "Xanax side effects" The drug dosage should be gradually reduced 
and only your doctor should advise you on how to discontinue or change your dose. 
How should you take Xanax? 
Xanax may be taken with or without food. Take it exactly as prescribed. Do not chew, crush, 
or break the Xanax XR tablets. 
--If you miss a dose... 
If you are less than 1 hour late, take it as soon as you remember. Otherwise skip the dose 
and go back to your regular schedule. Never take 2 doses at the same time. 
--Storage instructions... 
Store Xanax at room temperature.

Xanax side effects 
Side effects cannot be anticipated. If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor 
as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking 
Xanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax. 
Side effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with 
continued medication. However, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely. 
• Side effects of Xanax may include: 
Decreased libido, drowsiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment, 
speech difficulties, weight changes 
• Side effects of Xanax XR may include: 
Constipation, decreased libido, depression, drowsiness, fatigue, impaired 
coordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness, 
speech difficulties, weight changes 
• Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or 
Xanax XR: 
Anxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity, 
depression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot 
flushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle 
cramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching, 
weight loss 
Why should Xanax not be prescribed? 
If you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers, 
you should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or 
Nizoral. Make sure that your doctor Is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced. 
Do not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrow-angle 
glaucoma. 
Anxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax. 
Discuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor. 
Special warnings about Xanax 
Xanax may cause you to become drowsy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating 
dangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental 
alertness is not recommended. 
If you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than 
for anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long 
intervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor 
supervise you carefully when you are using Xanax. 
As with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage 
suicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria known as mania. If you notice any new or unusual 
symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately. 
Xanax should be used with caution In elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease, 
alcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.

Possible food and drug interactions when taking Xanax 
Xanax may intensify the effect of alcohol. Do not drink alcohol while taking Xanax. 
Never combine Xanax with Sporanox or Nizoral. These drugs cause a buildup of Xanax in the 
body.

or altered. It is important to check with your doctor before combining Xanax with the 
following: 
Amiodarone (Cordarone) 
Antihistamines such as Benadryl and Tavist 
Carbamazepine (Tegretol) 
Certain antibiotics such as Biaxin and erythromycin 
Certain antidepressant drugs, including Elavil, Norpramin, and Tofranil 
Cimetidine (Tagamet) 
Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) 
Digoxin (Lanoxin) 
Diltiazem (Cardizem) 
Disulfiram (Antabuse) 
Ergotamine 
Fluoxetine (Prozac) 
Fluvoxamine 
Grapefruit juice 
Isoniazid (Rifamate) 
Major tranquilizers such as Mellaril and chlorpromazine 
Nefazodone 
Nicardipine (Cardene) 
Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) 
Oral contraceptives 
Other central nervous system depressants such as Valium and Demerol 
Paroxetine (Paxil) 
Propoxyphene (Darvon) 
Sertraline (Zoloft) 
Special information if you are pregnant or breastfeeding 
Do not take Xanax if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There is an increased 
risk of respiratory problems and muscular weakness in your baby. Infants may also 
experience withdrawal symptoms. Xanax may appear in breast milk and could affect a nursing 
infant. If Xanax is essential to your health, your doctor may advise you to stop breastfeeding 
until your treatment with Xanax is finished. 
Recommended dosage for Xanax

increased by 1 milligram a day every 3 or 4 days. You may be given a dose from 1 up to a 
total of 10 milligrams, according to your needs. The typical dose is 5 to 6 milligrams a day. 
If you're taking Xanax XR, the usual starting dose is 0.5 to 1 milligram once a day taken in 
the morning. Depending on your response, the dose may be gradually increased by no more 
than 1 milligram every 3 or 4 days. The usual effective dose is 3 to 6 milligrams a day. Some 
people may need a larger dose to relieve their symptoms. Others, including older adults and 
those with liver disease or other serious illnesses, may need to use lower doses. 
CHILDREN 
Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 18 years of age. 
OLDER ADULTS 
The usual starting dose for an anxiety disorder is 0.25 milligram, 2 or 3 times daily. The 
starting dose of Xanax XR is 0.5 milligrams once a day. This dose may be gradually increased 
if needed and tolerated. 
PATIENTS SWITCHING FROM XANAX TO XANAX XR 
If you're taking divided doses of Xanax, the doctor will switch you to a once-daily dose of 
Xanax XR that equals the current amount you're taking. If your symptoms return after 
switching, the dose can be increased as needed. 
Overdosage 
An overdose of Xanax, alone or after combining it with alcohol, can be fatal. If you suspect an 
overdose, seek medical attention immediately. 
• Symptoms of Xanax overdose may include: 
Confusion, coma, impaired coordination, sleepiness, slowed reaction time

On '1/24/05 at about 21:49 hours I wen 
in reference to a 
susp ciciis person. I met with 	
who stated she has two juvenile daughters. 
Tonight she noticed they went across the street to a vacant house with some boys. When she 
went to check on them she caught the boys drinking alcohol. She knew the boys were juveniles 
so she bok the alcohol (tequila) from them she said a couple of the boys ran off. Juvenile one 
got in his silver Mitsubishi and went to the end of the street. He then stopped infront of her 
house. The juvenile stated he wanted his tequila back and he would come back at midnight 
is concerned juvenile one might return and damage her guests vehicles. Mrs. 
asked her juveniles who the subject was and they were unfamiliar. I gave Mrs. 
a case card. I returned into service with no further incident I informed morning watch 
o t i is address for an extra patrol for tonight only.

on patrol. I was dispatched to a missing person call at
rrived 
and made contact with the caller/mother of the missing juvenile female.
She 
stated her juvenile daughter left yesterday for school. and had not returned
told me she 
had spoken with her daughter around 1900 and she was going to the high school basketball 
game. Later on that night, some of the juveniles's friends called the mother and informed her 
they had not seen the juvenile at the game. 
When the juvenile didn't return this morning,
 
said she became worried and started to 
contact some of her daughter's friends. They told her they heard she was handing hanging 
around with Mr. Byron Elrod in an area known as "The Cut" which is located off Old Donaldson 
and Highway 140_ "The Cut" is a known drug area in the county. I completed a missing person's 
checklist and obtained a recent picture of the juvenile. I called Detective Allen and informed her 
of the situation. The mother did not want a juvenile complaint filed. I issued 
i a case card 
and asked her to call if she found any more information regarding her daughter 	
IS Ballard and 
I left the residence and returned to service. 
After patrolling Old Donaldson Rd and the Crissler Street area. we were unable to locate any 
additional 	
rmation as to the whereabouts of the female. Around 1200. I received a telephone 
call from 	
stating that she had found her daughter. and she was located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments 	
f Bells Ferry Rd The mother told me a friend of the family was going to pick the 
female up, and escort her back to the parents house. I told 	
to call 911 when her daughter 
returned and a deputy would be sent out to check on the welt eing of the juvenile. 
When the juvenile returned Sgt Thompson met with the juvenile and parents at the house. The 
Juvenile stated she had been drinking and had done some drugs fast night, and that she had 
been scared to call her parents. She then went to a friends house located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments and spent the night.
