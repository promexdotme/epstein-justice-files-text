Q 
Did you attempt to interview her? 
She's 
going to be coming in, and she is not a minor 
anymore, so what is her full name? 
A 
Her name is 
and I did 
attempt to interview 
, and 
was 
interviewed by Palm Beach Police Department and 
because of the statements she provided to the 
police department, she felt as if she needed a 
lawyer. So when I attempted to interview her, we 
ended up going through her lawyer. 
Q 
And just so the grand jury has a little 
bit of background, the interview with the Palm 
Beach Police Department was quite some time ago? 
A 
Yes, it was, in the fall of '05. 
Q 
And when Ms. 
started that 
conversation with the police, she was very 
forthcoming? 
A 
Yes, she was. 
Q 
Fully cooperative? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And what happened in the middle of that 
interview with the police? 
A 
The police just let 
know that she 
could be charged because 
brought some of the 
girls to Mr. Epstein and the police -- she was

very cooperative, but the police at that point had 
to let 
know that what she had done that she 
could be facing charges. 
Q 
And that was after they had told her 
earlier that she didn't need an attorney present, 
correct? 
A 
Exactly. 
Q 
Okay. So this happens to her with the 
Palm Beach Police Department and did the Palm 
Beach Police actually present or propose charging 
A 
They did get a probable cause affidavit 
against 
Q 
And is that why Ms. 
and her 
attorney were concerned about her testimony here? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Now was a subpoena issued for Ms. 
on behalf of this grand jury? 
A 
Yes, it was. 
Q 
And before Ms. 
would comply with 
that, did she -- did her attorney request some 
sort of order? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And what did he ask for? 
A 
He asked for immunity for

Q 
And let me show you the order, that is a 
sealed order in these grand jury proceedings. 
Now 
the immunity that has been provided for Ms. 
keeps her statements that are made here from being 
used against her? 
A 
Yes, it does. 
Q 
It doesn't -- if she commits perjury and 
she lies to the grand jury, can she still be 
charged? 
A 
Yes, she can. 
Q 
Okay. Could you read that? 
I know it 
is only two pages. 
A 
Sealed order, on application of the 
United States Attorneys for the Southern District 
of Florida and it appearing to the satisfaction of
