On December 3, 2009, Jeffrey Epstein and I met with opposing counsel in New 
York City, New York on a matter to review certain confidential documents, which 
counsel only would provide for our review in his offices. The meeting was very 
helpful,- but necessary time with Mr. Epstein was cut short due to his obvious time 
constraints. 
It is clear that the case requires considerable time, and is at the stage that we must 
review considerable additional documents and attempt to interview potential 
witnesses. It is impractical to bring the lawyers for the other side with their 
documents to Florida and Mr. Epstein's presence is required to prepare for and 
interview potential witnesses, who live in the New York area. We will need three 
more days of meetings with Mr. Epstein to determine our next course of action.

As a result, I would request that you provide me with a period of three days when 
Mr. Epstein can be available in New York to continue to work with us on this 
matter. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely
