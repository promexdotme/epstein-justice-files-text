Plaintiffs, Edwards and Cassell, by and through their undersigned counsel, and pursuant to 
the terms of the confidential settlement agreement and mutual release between the parties to this 
action, do hereby give notice of the withdrawal of the motion for partial summary judgment they 
filed in this lawsuit and all supporting documents. 
In the event that the noticed withdrawal is determined to be subject to Court approval, the 
Plaintiffs would show in support of this notice that Edwards and Cassell continue to represent 
Virginia Giuffre in separate pending matters, and shall continue to advance her legitimate legal 
interests in those matters. As expressly understood by the parties upon the execution of the 
Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, Ms. Giuffre reaffirms her allegations,

being, an acknowledgement by Edwards and Cassell that the allegations made by Ms. Giuffre were 
mistaken. Edwards and Cassell do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime Victims'

Notice of Withdrawal of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment

Rights Act case of their client's allegations against Defendant Dershowitz became a major 
distraction from the merits of the well-founded Crime Victims' Rights Act case by causing delay 
and, as a consequence, turned out to have been a tactical mistake. For that reason, Edwards and 
Cassell have chosen to withdraw the referenced filing as a condition of settlement. 
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve
