there is a specific business trip planned for the Defendant to bring the matter back before 
the Court and it would be considered.

I need you to come to New York City on December 3rd to meet with me and go to 
Davis Polk's office to review some documents that they will only show us in their 
office. 
They claim they are subject to confidentiality agreements. 
This is 
necessary to help us evaluate the above claim.
