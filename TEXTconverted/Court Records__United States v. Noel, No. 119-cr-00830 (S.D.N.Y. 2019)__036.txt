19 Cr. 830-2 (AT) 
ORDER 
On November 19, 2019, Defendant Michael Thomas was charged with one count of 
conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of 
making false statements with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or 
proper administration of a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United 
States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 100l(a)(3). ECF No. 1. The indictment alleges that Thomas, 
in his capacity as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the "MCC"), 
along with another officer, co-Defendant Tova Noel, submitted several false "count slips" on the 
night of August 9, 2019 and the morning of August 10, 2019, certifying that he conducted counts 
of the inmates he was supervising in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"), even though he 
did not conduct those counts. Id. tj[tj[ 16, 30, 36, 38, 40. During that time period, one of the 
inmates in the SHU-Jeffrey Epstein-hanged himself in his cell. Id. tj[tj[ 1, 2fr27. 
Thomas now moves to compel the Government to produce evidence in connection with 
the trial scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021. Motion, ECF No. 33. Thomas seeks three 
categories of information: (1) "[t]he report of the Inspector General" for the United States 
Department of Justice related to Epstein's death, and "any and all supplemental memorandums, 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports" obtained by the Inspector General's 
investigation, id, at 5; (2) "[a]ny and all internal investigative reports created by the [Bureau of 

2 
 
Prisons (the “BOP”)] as to both [D]efendants, including[] any and all supporting memorandums, 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports,” id. at 6; and (3) “any and all reports, 
memorandums, written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured, or 
possessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies[] participating in the investigation of the 
[D]efendants, allied with the prosecution, and to which the prosecution has access,” id. at 7. 
  For the reasons stated below, Thomas’ motion is DENIED. 
DISCUSSION 
 
The Government has already produced “surveillance video going back to July 5, 
2019 . . . ; count slips, thirty minute round forms, and staffing rosters for the three-week period 
surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone records; employee files and staffing history 
for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written [BOP] policies and regulations,” as well as 
“statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the investigation.”  Gov’t Opp. at 8–9, 
ECF No. 35. 
Thomas argues that he is entitled to additional discovery on two grounds:  (1) Rule 16 of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and (2) the constitutional guarantee of due process as 
expressed by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and 
Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972).  Motion at 1. 
I. 
Legal Standards 
A. Rule 16 
Rule 16 requires the Government to “permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or 
photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is within the government’s possession, 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 2 of 9

3 
 
custody, or control and:  (i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii) the [G]overnment 
intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs 
to the defendant.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E).  “Evidence is material if it could be used to 
counter the [G]overnment’s case or to bolster a defense.”  United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 
109 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds 
by Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018).  “In order to compel the Government to 
produce certain evidence, a defendant must make a prima facie showing of materiality, and must 
offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.”  United States 
v. Abdalla, 317 F. Supp. 3d 786, 790 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted).  “There must be some indication that the pretrial disclosure of the disputed evidence 
would enable the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.”  United 
States v. Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 261 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks, citation, 
and alterations omitted). 
 
Evidence is “within the [G]overnment’s possession, custody, or control” if “(1) it has 
actually reviewed [the evidence], or (2) [the evidence is] in the possession, custody, or control of 
a government agency so closely aligned with the prosecution so as to be considered part of the 
prosecution team.”  United States v. Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).  
“Legal ownership of the requested documents or things is not determinative, nor is actual 
possession necessary if the party has control of the items.  Control has been defined to include 
the legal right to obtain the documents requested upon demand.  The term ‘control’ is broadly 
construed.”  United States v. Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 350, 361 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted) (collecting cases). 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 3 of 9

If the Government represents that it “it has fully complied with [its Rule 16] obligations 
and will continue to do so,” the defendant must put forward some “compelling demonstration to 
the contrary” by pointing to a “specific failure by the Government to comply with its disclosure 
obligations” in order to justify a motion to compel.  United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28, 
34 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). 
B. Brady/Giglio 
Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government “has a 
constitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material 
to guilt or punishment,” and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to 
“not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key 
[G]overnment witness.”  United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001).  “Evidence is 
material within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the 
evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”  Turner v. 
United States, 137 S. Ct. 1885, 1893 (2017) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration 
omitted)); see also Coppa, 267 F.3d at 135 (“[T]he prosecutor must disclose evidence if, without 
such disclosure, a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome of a trial in which the 
evidence had been disclosed would have been different.”). 
“The prosecution’s obligation to disclose Brady material extends to any material in the 
possession of any entity that has acted as an ‘arm of the prosecutor’ in a given case.”  United 
States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 36, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) 
(quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 741 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)).  “A 
prosecutor’s duty to review documents in the possession, custody, or control of another agency 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 4 of 9

arises where the Government conducts a joint investigation with another agency.”  United States 
v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted).  In determining whether the prosecution has conducted a joint investigation, courts in 
this district look to a number of non-exhaustive factors, “including whether the other agency:  (1) 
participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to 
the grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, 
(4) played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the 
prosecution to court proceedings.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
As under Rule 16, if the Government has represented that it is aware of and has complied 
with its Brady and Giglio obligations, a defendant must make a “particularized showing that 
materials exist requiring disclosure” in order to sustain a motion to compel.  United States v. 
Juliano, No. 99 Cr. 1197, 2000 WL 640644, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2000); see United States v. 
Evanchik, 413 F.2d 950, 953 (2d Cir. 1969) (“[T]he assurance by the [G]overnment that it has in 
its possession no undisclosed evidence that would tend to exculpate defendant justifies the denial 
of a motion for inspection that does not make some particularized showing of materiality and 
usefulness.”) 
II. 
Inspector General Materials 
Thomas seeks disclosure of both the investigatory materials from the Department of 
Justice Office of the Inspector General’s (“OIG”) investigation regarding Epstein’s death, and a 
draft of the Inspector General’s report arising from that investigation.  Motion at 5.  The 
Government concedes that attorneys from OIG participated in the Government’s investigation 
that led to the indictment of Thomas.  Gov’t Opp. at 3, 19.  But, the Government represents that 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 5 of 9

6 
 
it has already delivered to Thomas all of the materials gathered by OIG personnel in the course 
of investigating this case, and that “it is the prosecution’s understanding that [OIG] attorneys 
have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise discovered any potential Brady 
material.”  Id. at 23–24.  Thomas has not identified any specific material that might be in OIG’s 
possession that has not been disclosed. 
The Court, therefore, has no basis to compel the Government to disclose additional 
evidence underlying the Inspector General’s report.  “[C]ourts in this circuit have repeatedly 
denied requests for discovery orders where the [G]overnment represents that it has produced 
discovery to defendants pursuant to Rule 16 and has made a good faith representation to the 
defense that it recognizes and has complied with its obligations under Brady and its progeny.”  
United States v. Garcia-Pena, No. 17 Cr. 363, 2018 WL 6985220, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 
2018) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted); see also, e.g., United States v. 
Blondet, No. 16 Cr. 387, 2019 WL 5690711, at *5 (“[T]o the extent that these motions seek 
evidence pursuant to Brady [], Giglio [], and their progeny, they are [denied] on the basis of the 
Government’s good-faith representation that it has complied with its obligations and will 
continue to do so.” (citations omitted)); United States v. Goode, No. 16 Cr. 529, 2018 WL 
919928, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2018) (“The Government represents that it has complied with 
Rule 16 obligations; the Rule 16 requests are therefore moot.” (citation omitted)). 
As for the draft Inspector General’s report itself, the Government reports that “attorneys 
from [OIG] responsible for writing the [r]eport have not yet completed a draft, and do not 
anticipate completing the [r]eport in the near term,” and so “there are no drafts of the [r]eport to 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 6 of 9

7 
 
disclose.”  Gov’t Opp. at 21–22.  The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to 
produce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.1   
Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel disclosure of materials related to the Inspector 
General’s investigation is DENIED. 
III. 
BOP Materials 
Thomas also seeks disclosure of “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] 
regarding” Epstein’s death, and “any and all documents, reports, witness statements and 
disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct” similar to 
that alleged against Thomas.  Motion at 6.  However, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the 
Government reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation.  Nor has he shown that 
BOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in 
presenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents 
with the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,” 
“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the 
investigation that led to the charges against him.  Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).  There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP 
personnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment.  Thus, the 
Court concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule 16 and 
Brady.  
 
To be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing 
alone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution.  “The court cannot find that 
                                               
1 Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address 
whether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it is protected 
by the deliberative process privilege.  See Gov’t Opp. at 12–15, 22–23. 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 7 of 9

the government is in constructive possession of the materials where, as here, defendant has not 
presented any evidence suggesting that the BOP was involved in the investigation or prosecution 
of this case.”  United States v. Rivera, No. 13 Cr. 149, 2015 WL 1540517, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 
7, 2015); see, e.g., United States v. Merlino, 349 F.3d 144, 155 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that 
Government did not violate Brady obligation in failing to turn over tapes in BOP possession 
because “the BOP was not part of the prosecutorial arm of the federal government as it was not 
at all involved in either the investigation or the prosecution of the defendants”); United States v. 
Battle, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1201–02 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (“Defendant implies that because the 
BOP employees are connected with the Department of Justice that the prosecution team 
constructively possessed exculpatory information that could have been within the knowledge of 
BOP staff. . . . Even if the Court assumes that some members of the BOP staff did possess 
favorable information that alone does not impute knowledge to the prosecution team.” (citing 
United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998)). 
 
Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence in the 
possession of the BOP is DENIED. 
IV. 
Other Materials 
Finally, Thomas seeks disclosure of information that he argues will tend to show that the 
conduct for which he is being prosecuted was:  “1) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with 
knowledge and acquiescence by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies 
that forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally, 
and; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory application of BOP policies 
by [G]overnment prosecutors.”  Motion at 7.  But Thomas has not provided support for his 
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT     Document 36     Filed 06/09/20     Page 8 of 9

9 
 
assertion that the Government, or any other agency that has operated as an arm of the 
prosecution, is in possession or control of evidence that relates to the prevalence of falsifying 
count slips in federal correctional facilities, or BOP leadership’s tolerance of such practices. 
Moreover, to the extent that Thomas is seeking discovery in support of a selective 
prosecution defense, he has not met the “rigorous” standard that applies for obtaining discovery 
in aid of such a claim.  United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 468 (1996).  “[A] defendant 
who seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must show some evidence of both 
discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.”  United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 
(2002).  Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of 
false count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submitted false documents in 
other circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in 
any protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.  
See Motion at 10.  Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his 
prosecution.  
Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the 
submission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery 
related to selective prosecution, is DENIED. 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED.  The Clerk of Court is 
directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 33.
