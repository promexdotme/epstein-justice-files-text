Entered By.: OREGERO, LAURA D. 
On Sunday 10/5/03 at approximately 0824 hours, I 
was dispatched to a burglary at 358 El Brillo Way. Upon 
arrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white 
male, dob/012053. Epstein advised he and his personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/052579, arrived in 
the residence on Friday evening, 10/3/03. Epstein advised 
that on Saturday evening 10/4/03, he left his briefcase at his 
desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein 
said when he left hie briefcase, it contained approximately 
$5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100 
bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase. 
Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday, 
10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had 
been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein 
believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase. 
Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was 
sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black 
Glock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind 
his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been 
taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was 
in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day

approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see 
anything unusual through the night or on the morning of 
10/5/03. Cotrin, the resident chef advised that he went to

approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03. Cotrin stated that he did 
not see or hear anything unusual from the staff residence 
locate don the east side of the property. I next spoke to Mike 
and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike 
stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately 
8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm 
same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said 
he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on 
10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated 
that she checked the exterior of the residence at 
approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties. 
Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything 
appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at 
approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30 
on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie 
Friedman have been employed as the house managers since 
9/24/03. Prior to them, the live on site house managers were 
Patrick and Evelyn, Epstein was unsure of the last name. 
Patrick Evelyn were employed at 358 El Brillo approximately 
9 months. Prior to the house manager was John Alessi who 
was employee at 358 El Brillo approximately 10 years. 
Epstein signed an affidavit of prosecution, it is attached to 
this report. Crime Scene manager Parkinson responded and 
processed the scene. Det. Melnichok also responded. Bee 
Det. Melnichok's report for further information. Officer Nault 
responded and conducted a neighborhood canvas which is

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way 
reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during 
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who 
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOE 01/20/53. 
Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he 
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on 
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the 
amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident 
and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on 
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a 
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. 
Epstein then placed $4,000. in 6.S. currency, one hundred dollar 
bill increments and left the bag on his desk an he always does 
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the 
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up 
and twice to have $100. miseinglfrom the bag and the suspects 
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there 
were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope 
and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the 
suspect. 
Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer 
monitor that was displaying a s ill frame of the suspect. The 
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into 
the office area, walked behind Ehe desk, opened the hand bag, and 
then opened the center drawer td the desk. It appeared as though 
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein 
told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was 
but thought it might be his fortier houseman because of his size 
and shape. Epstein also pointed 
video was wearing moccasin type 
out that the suspect in the 
shoes like his former houseman 
did due to his back injury, 
was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs. 
and a hat. Epstein provided 
information which was Juan P. 
1515 South Elegies Dr., Apt. 
The suspect was a white male who

, earing tan pants, white shirt, 
me with the former houseman's 
Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, living at 
1901, West Palm Beach, Florida.

surveillance video from his comuter hard drive in order to

have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working 
knowledge of the system but he ould contact the company who 
had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. 
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. 
Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told 
me that he believed that the suSpect might have gained entry 
into the house from the eliding glass doors on the south side 
of the house but not the west 8 de of house because he had 
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. 
It is believed that the suspectlalso left the house by the 
same sliding door that was unlo ked as there were no pry marks 
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed 
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm 
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could 
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this 
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee 
Blvd. to obtain the information 
Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkin+Ln processed the crime scene and 
collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.

At 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home 
by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a 
burglary had been reported at 358 81 Brillo. I responded to the 
scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up 
the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process 
the crime scene. 
went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. 
Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west 
end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with 
the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two 
story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim 
is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with 
metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch 
pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops 
of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals 
approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. 
The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way 
leading to a three car garage. 
The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage 
two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on 
them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The 
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was 
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west 
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep 
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with 
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk 
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra 
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any 
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have 
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None 
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was 
79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small 
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer 
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been 
touched or tampered with. 
On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr. 
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the 
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer 
room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass 
windows present. The eastern most and western most are 
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has 
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of 
14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a 
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was 
found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did 
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The 
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism 
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to 
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were 
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the 
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a 
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a 
rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central 
window. 
Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is 
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The 
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on 
the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The 
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash 
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar 
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen 
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det. 
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned 
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the 
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for 
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found 
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters 
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a 
supplement to that effect that will follow.

On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to 
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video 
footage of the suspect burglar. 
Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at 
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before 
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein 
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk 
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto 
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a 
property receipt. 
At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers 
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm 
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed 
several video cameras on the outside of the building and 
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the 
building. 
At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager 
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the 
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach 
identification card application. 
At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and 
spoke with the manager of the condominium who 
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement. 
Dement gave me his direct business number 
561-833-8170, and his home phone number 
561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar 
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't 
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several 
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance 
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday 
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes. 
Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight 
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and 
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door 
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement 
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to 
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on 
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with 
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he 
advised that he would check and call me back in the 
morning.

On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into 
the police department and informed me that earlier today he met 
with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm 
Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph 
obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi 
admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi 
told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that 
Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the 
gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having 
problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun 
because he was contemplating suicide. 
Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the 
stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi 
to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of 
Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that 
Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would 
make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to 
be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute 
Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said 
he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi 
said he does not have it. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein 
and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of 
the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

her husband on 10/08/03, in which she responded to the apartment 
building, 1515 South Flager Drive, at approximately 2:00 a.m. 
Mrs. Alessi stated she contacted West Palm Beach Police Department 
via 911, and officer's responded. I contacted the West Palm Beach

Officer Sean Phillips responded to that address in reference to a 
911 phone call. There is no report on file and list said CAD 
entry only that Juan P. Alessi was in the building reference to a 
civil matter. They have no current information for Mr. Alessi. 
This concludes my involvement in the matter.

On 10/13/03, Det. Pagan and I went to 1515 So. Flagler 
Drive, Apt. #1901, West Palm Beach, Florida, in an 
attempt to locate suspect Juan Alessi. As we were 
getting into the elevator on the ground floor, we came in 
contact with Alessi's wife, Marie Alessi. I explained to 
Marie why we were there and she agreed to speak to us. 
Marie said she and her husband, Juan Alessi, have been 
separated for approximately two months and they are 
going through divorce proceedings. Marie said Juan no 
longer lives with her at this address and she has a court 
order which states Juan is to have no contact with her. 
Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours, 
Juan drove by her as she was walking out of the Ross 
Department Store located on the southeast corner of 
Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan 
waved at her and that was the extent of their contact. 
Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She 
said he is driving a white Caravan. Marie supplied me 
with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie 
advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their 
separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her 
surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she 
comes in contact with him to Call the police 
immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's 
phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645. 
I called Juan Alessi on his cell phone. Juan agreed to 
come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview. 
Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him 
in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read 
Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in

Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as 
the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with 
Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked

past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did 
take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained

about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous 
medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he 
became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr_ 
Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. 
Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. 
Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver 
revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan 
did not know the exact date, but he said it was 
approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a 
Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's 
house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the 
gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it 
in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the 
house through an unlocked sliding glass door located 
near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office 
and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched 
the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then 
went into Epstein's briefcase and removed 
approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan sai after taking the money he 
immediately left the house.

On 10/08/03 , Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan 
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers 
Condominium . Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's 
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag 
1372UGL. 
On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met 
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money 
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time. 
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and 
had obtained a. full confession on the theft of the money but had 
denied taking the Glock hand gun. 
In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location 
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the 
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show 
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun. 
On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution 
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that 
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with 
mailing the original back to me for my case file. 
At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance 
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo. 
Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution 
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met 
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that 
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at 
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan 
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.

Fronstin had telephoned her reference this case. Although nothing was 
discussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate 
about massages.

a subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on 
Monday November 21, 2005 at 12:00 p.m.

Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney Office. ASA Weiss had 
requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the 
Alessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her attorney, 
Donnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight 
years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had 
never had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her 
husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing 
house cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would 
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing 
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view 
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or 
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The 
girls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not know any 
of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that 
when Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis 
during his stay in Palm Beach. 
I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie 
Murrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with 
Mr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then 
moved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.

masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that 
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and

that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or 
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a 
massage. Alessi stated that there were.times towards the end of his 
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a 
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.

As we entered onto the property, we encountered the house manager, 
Janusz Banasiak who was in the guest portion of the house. The 
guesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made. I 
made contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth 04-07-1953, Fl DL 
, and informed him of the search warrant for the 
premises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence 
and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and 
members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr 
Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior 
decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of 
515 W 20th Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for 
Mr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2005 to 
do'a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone 
with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr. 
Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised, 
his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never 
witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or 
Nada. 
I then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 315 East 14th Street in New York. 
Mr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised 
he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr. 
Epstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein's 
assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with 
Epstein everywhere he goes. 
I interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey. 
Bailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and•has worked with Zeff 
for only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not 
seen him. The interview was then concluded. 
I then spoke with Douglas Schoettle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York 
City. Schoettle stated he has been Epstein's Architect for seven 
years. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and 
speaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoettle stated he mainly speaks

are needed. 
At approximately 10:30 am, I was informed that the videotaping was 
concluded. I entered the residence and located two covert (hidden) 
cameras. The first camera was a covert wall clock in the garage area. 
I traced the wire behind the clock and removed the RCA wire and 
unplugged the camera. The other covert camera was located within a 
desk clock beside Epstein's desk. I traced the wire behind the clock 
and unplugged the RCA wire. I could not locate another camera. I 
then began with the search of the residence for the specified 
evidence.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein's home located at 
358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master 
bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the 
master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked 
young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the 
house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a 
duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn 
on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers 
were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been 
interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other 
names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I 
have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. 
During the execution of the warrant, I located a 	
transcript fo
 Epstein's 
bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside 
Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of "Joy Jelly," which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage 
tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located 
in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein's desk. A computer was located 
-hich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer's hard drive was reviewed 
-nich showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these 
images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein's desk.

remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein's assistant. She was led 
upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the 
lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom.and 
bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom.111, described the bathroom as a large

Reported By: DESMARAIS, WENDY D. 
Entered By.: OREGERO, LAURA D. 
On Sunday 10/5/03 at approximately 0824 hours, I 
was dispatched to a burglary at 358 El Brillo Way. Upon 
arrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white 
male, dob/012053. Epstein advised he and his personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/052579, arrived in 
the residence on Friday evening, 10/3/03. Epstein advised 
that on Saturday evening 10/4/03, he left his briefcase at his 
desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein 
said when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately 
$5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100 
bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase. 
Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday, 
10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had 
been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein 
believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase 
Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was 
sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black 
Glock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind 
his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been 
taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was 
in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day 
weekend Aug. 30-Sept 1, 2003. The second time was a 
weekend in mid September, 2003. Epstein stated he did not

report these incidents because he was not sure the money 
was accounted for. Possible footage of the incident may 
exist. I next met with Kellen who advised she went to bed at 
approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see 
anything unusual through the night or on the morning of 
10/5/03. Cotrin, the resident chef advised that he went to 
bed at approximately 1030 pm on 10/4/03 and began work at 
approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03. Cotrin stated that he did 
not see or hear anything unusual from the staff residence 
locate don the east side of the property. I next spoke to Mike 
and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike 
stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately 
8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm 
same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said 
he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on 
10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated 
that she checked the exterior of the residence at 
approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties. 
Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything 
appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at 
approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30 
on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie 
Friedman have been employed as the house managers since 
9/24/03. Prior to them, the live on site house managers were 
Patrick and Evelyn, Epstein was unsure of the last name. 
Patrick Evelyn were employed at 358 El Brillo approximately 
9 months. Prior to the house manager was John Alessi who 
was employee at 358 El Brillo approximately 10 years. 
Epstein signed an affidavit of prosecution, it is attached to 
this report. Crime Scene manager Parkinson responded and 
processed the scene. Det. Melnichok also responded. See 
Det. Melnichok's report for further information. Officer Nault 
responded and conducted a neighborhood canvas which is

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way 
reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during 
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who 
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53. 
Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he 
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on 
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the 
amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident 
and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on 
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a 
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. 
Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar 
bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does 
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the 
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up 
and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects 
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there 
were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope 
and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the 
suspect. 
Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer 
monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The 
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into 
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and 
then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though 
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein 
told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was 
but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size 
and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the 
video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman 
did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who 
was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt, 
and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's 
information which was Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, living at 
1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida. 
I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the 
surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to 
have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working 
knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who 
had installed the sytem and have them make a copy by Monday. 	
 
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. 
Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told 
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry 
into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side 
of the house but not the west side of house because he had 
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. 
It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the 
same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks 
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed 
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm 
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could 
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this 
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee 
Blvd. to obtain the information. 
Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and 
collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.

On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to 
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal 
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video 
footage of the suspect burglar. 
Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at 
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before 
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein 
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk 
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto 
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a 
property receipt. 
At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers 
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm 
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed 
several video cameras on the outside of the building and 
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the 
building. 
At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager 
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the 
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach 
identification card application. 
At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and 
spoke with the manager of the condominium who 
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement. 
Dement gave me his direct business number 
561=833-8170, and his home  phone number 
561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar 
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't 
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several 
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance 
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday 
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes. 
Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight 
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and 
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door 
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement 
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to 
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on 
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with 
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he 
advised that he would check and call me back in the 
morning.

he lives at 358 El Brillo. Juan said he worked for Mr. 
Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as 
the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with 
Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked 
Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the 
past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did 
take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained 
approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed 
about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous 
medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he 
became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. 
Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. 
Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. 
Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver 
revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan 
did not know the exact date, but he said it was 
approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a 
Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's 
house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the 
gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it 
in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the 
house through an unlocked sliding glass door located 
near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office 
and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched 
the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then 
went into Epstein's briefcase and removed 
approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he 
immediately left the house. 
Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at 
approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 
El Brillo in order to steal money once again from 
Epstein. Juan said he once again_drove_his whitP 
Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan 
entered the house through the sliding glass door and 
entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase 
and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said he left through the same 
glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he 
wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a 
short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did 
not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the 
money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers. 
I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was 
not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly 
basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan 
once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house. 
Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03, 
and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the 
money that was taken.

Greetings from Tallahassee 
Current mood: C:) peaceful 
I made it! I'm at 
I love It here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of 
the other dorms on campus. I've been going to Class now for three weeks and I love 
it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in 
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with 
The weather, 
most of the time is perfect.. Its beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I 
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over'. We're going to have the best time! 
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a 
descent chance at the dean's list. 0MG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss

So, I am officially a "college gal." The past two days have been Incredibly stressful. 
I've been so busy; all I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm yesterday but I 
still have alot of stuff to buy to make it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is

awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only 
have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy 
too. I'm excited, Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's 
going on, 	
 I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who knows,.... : :sigh:: I'm not 
used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women 
on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I 
don't know how I'm going to adjust, I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished 
orientation today. It was s00000 boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all 
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the 
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be 
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it 
this morning at 3am because I had to relister today and I had no idea what I wanted 
to do. I'm so last minute on everythingaCAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME 
	
 I CAN'TWAITHifill!!!!illiiill (Hold On: Letme say 
that again) I CAN' WAIT TO BUY WEED11111111111illill111111111 I also want to get a 
v-vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs' 
everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If 
you've readto this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this 
thing up, 	
 I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you 
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so 
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me. 
Wish me luck!

Current mood: Et) crappy 
I am leaving Will to go to 
in three days. I am moving to Tallahassee in twelve 
days. I'm so sad; I can't stand it. I guess you can say I'm sulking, 	
but I can't help 
the way I feel. The whole thing is so bitter-sweet.

rough times 
Current mood: sad 
Everything sucks right now. 
My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come 
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) 
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying 
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already 
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see 
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or 
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank 
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being 
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been 
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally 
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. 
There's been so much death around me. It's really 
overwhelming.

predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of 
that time together will be horrible, 	
" the complete 
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the 
second day that we were here but all I did was get 
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" 
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. 
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a 
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an 
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a 
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores 
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I 
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. 
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I 
think it's a good fit for hlm. I really hope he gets it. 
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview 
the day he came in with the application, I think that's 
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right 
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a 
Ill' while. It's only 3:45 right now.a)h, it was so 
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS 
job and the lady called me back and told me that 
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence 
that she didn't need to call anyone else back, 	
he 
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound 
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the 
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Stri No 
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke 
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply 
of mary j and have to conserve. 1 miss everyone back 
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

(Continued) 
Fronstin had telephoned her reference this case. Although nothing was 
discussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate 
about massages. 
I also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss reference the previous employees, 
Juan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through 
a subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on 
Monday November 21, 2005 at 12:00 p.m. 
On November 21, 2005, I met with ASA Weiss, Atty. Donnie Murrell and 
Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney Office. ASA Weiss had 
requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the 
Alessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her attorney, 
Donnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight 
years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had 
never had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her 
husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing 
house cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would 
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing 
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view 
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or 
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The 
girls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not know any 
of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that 
when Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis 
during his stay in Palm Beach. 
I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie 
Murrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with 
Mr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then 
moved up into a full time position. His duties included everything. 
Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance 
person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s 
arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they 
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing 
with his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with 
Epstein directly. 
I asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr. 
Alessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each 
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that 
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and 
younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be 
sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would 
occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled 
that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or 
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a 
massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his 
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a 
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
ldditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made 
After the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the

10/15/03 
On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into 
the police department and informed me that earlier today he met 
with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm 
Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph 
obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi 
admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi 
told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that 
Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the 
gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having 
problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun 
because he was contemplating suicide. 
Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the 
stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi 
to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of 
Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that 
Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would 
make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to 
be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute 
Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said 
he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi 
said he does not have it. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein 
and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of 
the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

he lives at 358 El Brillo. Juan said he worked for Mr. 
Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as 
the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with 
Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked 
Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the 
pact weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did 
take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained 
approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed 
about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous 
medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he 
became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. 
Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. 
Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. 
Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver 
revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan 
did not know the exact date, but he said it was 
approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a 
Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's 
house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the 
gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it 
in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the 
house through an unlocked sliding glass door located 
near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office 
and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched 
the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then 
went into Epstein's briefcase and removed 
approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he 
immediately left the house. 
Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at 
approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 
El Brillo in order to steal money once again from 
Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white 
Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan 
entered the house through the sliding glass door and 
entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase 
and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a 
white envelope. Juan said he left through the same 
glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he 
wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a 
short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did 
not wear gloves on hie hands. Juan said he needed the 
money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers. 
I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was 
not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly 
basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan 
once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house. 
Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03, 
and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the 
money that was taken.

On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan 
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers 
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's 
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag 
17720GL. 
On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met 
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money 
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time. 
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and 
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had 
denied taking the Glock hand gun. 
In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location 
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the 
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show 
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun. 
On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution 
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that 
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with 
mailing the original back to me for my case file. 
CAt 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance 
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brill2j 
 
Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution 
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met 
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that 
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at 
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan 
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS; Please show a full recovery of the U.S. 
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.

marijuana rolled in brown paper. I then asked the remainder of the 
occupants separately if they had marijuana and a female, identified as

Greetings from Tallahassee 
Current mood: 
peaceful 
I made it! I'm at 
I love it here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of 
the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love 
it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in 
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with 
The weather, 
most of the time is perfect.. Its beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I 
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over. We're going to have the best time! 
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a 
descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss 
everyone! X0X0 -

So, I am officially a "college gal." The past two days have been incredibly stressful. 
I've been so busy; all I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm yesterday but I

awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only 
have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy 
too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's 
going on, 	
 I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not 
used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women 
on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast It feels like it right now. I 
don't know how I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished 
orientation today. It was s00000 boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all 
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the 
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be 
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it 
this morning at 3am because I had to ru.ister today and I had no idea what I wanted 
to do. I'm so last minute on everythinglECAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME 
	
 I CAN'T WAITHIIIIHIHHIIIIH (Hold On: Let me say 
that again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY WEED!!!!!!!!IIHIIIIIIMIllil I also want to get a 
A \-vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs' 
everywhereWell, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If 
you've reao this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this 
thing up, 	
 I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you 
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so 
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me. 
Wish me luck!

rough times 
Current mood: ep sad 
Everything sucks right now. 
My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come 
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) 
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying 
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already 
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see 
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or 
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank 
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being 
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been 
snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally 
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. 
There's been so much death around me. It's really 
overwhelming.

predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of 
that time together will be horrible,.,.." the complete 
opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the 
second day that we were here but all I did was get 
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" 
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. 
Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a 
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an 
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a 
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores 
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I 
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. 
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I 
think it's a good fit for hlm. I really hope he gets it. 
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview 
the day he came in with the application, I think that's 
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right 
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a 
Ill' while. It's only 3:45 right now.COh, it was so 
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS 
job and the lady called me back and told me that 
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence 
that she didn't need to call anyone else back, 	
he 
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound 
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the od 
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str No 
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke 
some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply 
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back 
home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

Current mood: (J pissed off 
CI forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret. They said they 
suspected me of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the way is bullshit! I 
was 'by the book' on EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I handed 
the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE 
MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$$. 
I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately-

DETECTIVE: 	
The next time you went, or as you continued to go, did it escalate 
2 	
more? 
3 
4 
Uh huh. I actually, I don't remember how long it took for me to 
5 	
start working for him regularly from the first time I went there, urn. 
6 	
But, I started working every day. Every single day he was in the 
7 	
country I would be there. Um, I'm, I'm sorry, I like — can you give 
8 	
me a second. 
9 
10 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Sure, absolutely. 
11 
12 
Yeah. I started working there every single day, and urn, I told him 
13 	
that I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me, that was my rule. 
14 	
Nothing inside of me, no fingers, no, no nothing, absolutely 
15 	
nothing inside of me. He increased my pay to three or four 
16 	
hundred dollars as long as he could touch me. Urn, I still never, I, 
17 	
I swear I never touched him, the whole entire time I never ever 
18 	
touched him. Urn, but he, he 
19 
20 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//How many times would you say you went? 
21 
22 
Hundreds. Hundreds, I was — he used to tell me I was his favorite. 
23 	
He bought me a car. He bought me 
24 
25 	
DETECTIVE: 	
//This Jeep that you're driving? 
26 
27 
No. I had a brand new Dodge Neon. I got plane, I got a plane 
28 
ticket to New York, I got spending money whenever I wanted. 
29 	
Like, I was in there deep. I was — he asked my parents to 
30 	
emancipate me so I could live with him. Or he didn't ask my 
31 	
parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I'm sorry. He act — he 
32 	
actually wanted me to come live with him. 
33 
34 	
DETECTIVE: 	
As like a girlfriend? 
35 
36 
Sex slave, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Urn, but it 
37 
escalated — he, he just increased my pay, as long as he could touch 
38 	
me. I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me. And then one 
39 	
day he just did, one day he just put his hand like his fingers. And 
40 	
urn, 
41 
42 	
DETECTIVE: 	
How long would you say, from the very first time you went, 
43 
44 
Months. Honestly, I never kept track, like of, of what happened 
45 	
when. I just can tell you in which order things progressed.

Yeah. 
11 
12 
That what you mean? He bought the car in, [sigh] I gotta recall, I 
13 	
haven't thought about this in forever. Urn. I can I can give you 
14 	
like four, four months that it possibly was during, but I can't 
15 	
specifically remember if it was before or after the New Year. Urn, 
16 	
November, December, January February, that just passed. 
17 
18 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Of 2004? 
19 
20 
Wait a second. 
21 
22 	
DETECTIVE: 	
So were you a senior in high school when you had the car? 
23 
24 
Yeah, it was recently. 
25 
26 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. 
27 
28 
It was, it was like, towards the middle and end of my school year. 
29 	
But I remember that for the last like six or eight weeks of high 
30 	
school, I didn't have a car cause I gave it back to him. Because he, 
31 	
he asked me to have sex with him and like, like suck him and stuff 
32 	
[giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not. I was like, I'll let 
33 	
you touch me but I'm not gonna do that. 
34 
35 
This is 2005, right? 
36 
37 
Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the 
38 	
New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a 
39 	
year before they were supposed to come out. So if I got it, I 
40 	
obviously didn't get a 2006 cause that's this year. I got a 2005 
41 	
Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. That car was 
42 	
awesome [giggles]. 
43 
44 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay. And that's the car that you used to drive to and from, 
45 
46 
To and from school, just out with my friends.

1 	
know that I did this with somebody. Cause he, he cares a lot about 
2 	
me and stuff, and I stopped working but then I lied to, I lied to Will 
3 	
a couple times and I worked, but then Will found out. And that's 
4 	
when, like he, he broke up with me, and then that once he broke up 
5 	
with me that was what I needed to really snap me into reality and 
6 	
quit. But there was like a few, like a, like I'd say a three month, 
7 	
like three and a half months like during that time, 
8 
9 	
DETECTIVE: 	
This year? 
10 
11 
Well this year was only like, maybe six weeks that I didn't work, 
12 
but since the New Year, since the beginning of this New Year, 
13 	
from January 1st  to like April, in between then was probably six 
14 	
weeks where I didn't work. Urn, and then I don't remember when 
15 	
my other hiatus was, like I don't really remember but that was 
16 	
towards like the beginning. 
17 
18 	
DETECTIVE: 	
What, what did you do with all the money that you made? 
19 
20 
Do I have to tell you? Cause I don't think it's any of your business 
21 
[laughs]. 
22 
23 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Okay, you don't have to. 
24 
25 
I'm sorry. I'm not like involved in drugs or anything like that, but, 
26 
I really just don't wanna tell you. 
27 
28 	
DETECTIVE: 	
That's fine. 
29 
30 
Cause I don't have anything to show for any of it. I spent it all. I 
31 
spent it all. 
32 
33 	
DETECTIVE 2: 	
Okay, okay. I get paid, I spend my money too. 
34 
35 
//[laughs] 
36 
37 	
DETECTIVE 2: 	
So I mean it happens, right? 
38 
39 
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I just told you on, on the New Year I 
40 
was in New York on his dime. So, yeah. 
41 
42 	
DETECTIVE: 	
Were you there on his plane? 
43 
44 
No, not on his plane. He was using his plane, I think he had to do 
45 	
something. He has, owns an island in the Caribbean, you guys all 
46 	
know that, I'm sure. But urn, I think he was flying to his island

Narrative 
While on patrol, I was dispatched to a missing person call at 411 Christopher Court. I arrived 
and made contact with the caller/mother of the missing juvenile female. - 	 She 
stated her juvenile daughter left yesterday for school, and had not returned. - 	
told me she 
had spoken with her daughter around 1900 and she was going to the high school basketball 
game. Later on that night, some of the juveniles's friends called the mother and informed her 
they had not seen the juvenile at the game. 
When the juvenile didn't return this morning, _ 	
said she became worried and started to 
contact some of her daughter's friends. They told her they heard she was handing hanging 
around with Mr. Byron Elrod in an area known as 'The Cut" which is located off Old Donaldson 
and Highway 140. "The Cut" is a known drug area in the county. I completed a missing person's 
checklist and obtained a recent picture of the juvenile. I called Detective Allen and informed her 
of the situation. The mother did not Want a juvenile complaint filed. I issued ^ 	
a case card 
and asked her to call if she found any more information regarding her daughter. D/S Ballard and 
I left the residence and returned to service. 
After patrolling Old Donaldson Rd and the Crissler Street area, we were unable to locate any 
additional information as to the whereabouts of the female. Around 1200, I received a telephone 
call from - 	
stating that she had found her daughter, and she was located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments off Bells Ferry Rd. The mother told me a friend of the family was going to pick the 
female up, and escort her back to the parents house. I told _ _ 	
to call 911 when her daughter 
returned and a deputy would be sent out to check on the well being of the juvenile. 
When the juvenile returned Sgt Thompson met with the juvenile and parents at the house. The 
Juvenile stated she had been drinking and had done some drugs last night, and that she had 
been scared to call her parents. She then went to a friends house located at Gregory Lane 
Apartments and spent the night.
