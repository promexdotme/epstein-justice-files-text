that any unrepresented party is required to appear at the conference in person. Finally, upon receipt of this
notice, please immediately furnish Chambers with a courtesy copy of your complaint and F.R.C.P.

Since this case has been designated an electronic case, by the date of the initial pretrial 
conference counsel for all parties are required to register as filing users in accordance with the
