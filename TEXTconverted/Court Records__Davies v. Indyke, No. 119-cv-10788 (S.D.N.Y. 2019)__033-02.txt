2. 
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil matter pursuant to 4 V.I.C. 
§ 76 and 14 V.I.C. § 607. 
3. 
This Court has personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 V.I.C. § 4903. 
4. 
The Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States. It consists 
of St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and Water Island, and more than 40 surrounding islands and 
Cays, some of which are privately owned. Among these privately owned islands are Little St. 
James and Great St. James. 
5. 
Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Epstein") was a resident of the Virgin Islands and he 
maintained a residence on Little St. James, which he acquired in 1998 and in 2016 he also 
purchased Great St. James. 
6. 
Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands in 2010. He was a Tier 1 
offender under Virgin Islands law based upon his Florida conviction of procuring a minor for 
prostitution. As a Tier 1 offender, Epstein was required to register annually with the Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice ("VIDOJ") and give advance notice of his travel to and from the Virgin 
Islands. Epstein was also subject to random address verification by VIDOJ. 
7. 
Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019 while in custody in New York for sex 
cnmes. 
8. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke ("Defendant Indyke") is co-executor of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust. 
9. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn ("Defendant Kahn") is co-executor of The Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust. 
10. 
Defendant, the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Estate"), created upon Epstein's death, 
is domiciled in the Virgin Islands. On August 15, 2019, Defendants Indyke and Kahn filed a 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 4 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 3 of55 
Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary which included Epstein· s last will and testament 
with the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
11. 
The Petition reports the value of the real and personal property in The Estate located 
in the Virgin Islands at $577,672,654.00 dollars. 
12. 
According to the Petition, the assets in the Virgin Islands thus far includes: 
a. $56.5 million in cash; 
b. $127 million in fixed income and equity investments; 
c. $195 million in hedge fund and private equity investments; and 
d. $18.5 million in planes, boats, and automobiles. 
The Estate has not yet valued his fine arts, antiques, and other valuables. 
13. 
The Estate also includes shares of various corporate entities which hold residences 
and real property used by Epstein, namely: 
a. Brownstone in New York City valued at $56 million; 
b. Ranch in New Mexico valued at $72 million; 
c. Gated home in Palm Beach, Florida, valued at $12 million; 
d. Seven units in an apartment building in Paris, valued at $8 million; and 
e. Great St. James and Little St. James, collectively valued at $86 million. 
14. 
The Estate is responsible to pay damages for the acts committed by Epstein and the 
Epstein Enterprise described below. 
15. 
Defendant The 1953 Trust ("The Trust") was created by Epstein, who "amended 
and restated" its terms only two days before his suicide. That same day, Epstein revised his Last 
Will and Testament, transferring all of his "property, real and personal, wherever situated" to The 
Trust.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page4 of55 
16. 
The Trust also contains Epstein's financial assets and is also responsible to pay 
damages for the acts committed by Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise described below. 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn, filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands 
for The Trust on August 26, 2019. 
17. 
Epstein maintained a deliberately complex web of Virgin Islands corporations, 
limited liability companies, foundations, and other entities, not all of which are yet known to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands, through which he carried out and concealed his criminal 
conduct. 
18. 
Epstein regularly created new entities in the territory and transferred properties and 
funds between them in order to preserve and shield Epstein's assets and to facilitate and conceal 
the unlawful acts described in this Complaint. 
19. 
These entities held properties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at 
which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned and 
arranged for private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from, and 
within the Virgin Islands, and provided money to pay these young women and underage girls. 
20. 
Epstein sat at the hub of this web, serving as president, member, manager, or 
director of each of the entities and, upon information and belief, directing their activities. 
21. 
Defendant, Nautilus, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. It was incorporated on November 22, 2011. 
22. 
According to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns 
Little St. James, a/k/a Parcel Number 109803010100, a parcel of 3.1 million square feet valued at 
$3.2 million, with buildings and improvements valued at $4 million. 
T

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 5 of55 
23. 
Epstein was president and director of Nautilus, Inc., which corporate filings 
describe as ·'holding property for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are the secretary and 
treasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values Epstein's holdings of Nautilus, Inc., 
which holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million. 
24. 
A deed recorded with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds on December 30, 2011 
reflects that the prope1iy was transferred from a Delaware entity, L.S.J., LLC, to Nautilus, Inc. for 
"TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.'' The quitclaim deed lists 
Jeffrey Epstein as the sole member of L.S.J., LLC, which it acquired Little Saint James via a 
warranty deed dated April 27, 1998. 
25. 
As described below, Epstein engaged in a pattern and practice of trafficking and 
sexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. 
James where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin 
Islands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from 
leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 
26. 
Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated m carrymg out, facilitating and concealing 
Epstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
27. 
Defendant, Great St. Jim, LLC, is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was organized on October 26, 
2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, owns at 
least three properties that make up Great St. James acquired on January 28, 2016: Parcel Number 
109801010100, consisting of 3 .5 million square feet and valued at $17 .5 million; Parcel Number 
109801010200, consisting of 450,000 square feet of land, valued at $2.8 million; and Parcel 
Number 109801010300, 1.2 million square feet of land, valued at $2. 7 million. According to a 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 7 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 6 of55 
warranty deed filed with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Epstein, through Great St. Jim, 
LLC, acquired the last two parcels for $5 million each. 
28. 
Epstein is listed as manager and a member of Great St. Jim, LLC and the nature of 
its business is described as "holding assets." 
29. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein purchased these Great St. James properties-
the island with closest proximity to Little St. James-to further shield his conduct on Little St. 
James from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the public, and allow him to 
continue and conceal his criminal enterprise. Epstein's significant investment in the purchase of 
Great St. James demonstrates his intent to expand his illegal operation in the Virgin Islands for 
years to come. Thus, Great St. Jim, LLC participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and 
continuing Epstein's crimes, and Great St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
30. 
Defendant, Poplar, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. Poplar, Inc. was incorporated on November 22, 2011. Epstein was president 
and director of Poplar, Inc., and its purpose was described in corporate filings as "holding property 
for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are secretary and treasurer of Poplar, Inc., 
respectively. 
31. 
A certificate of incumbency provided to the Department of Planning and Natural 
Resources ("DPNR") also lists Epstein as president of Poplar, Inc. and expressly authorizes the 
incorporators to conduct "transactions related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great 
St. Jim, LLC." 
32. 
Poplar, Inc. is listed as the signatory for the 2017 Annual Report for Great St. Jim, 
LLC, and the signature appears to be Epstein's. The Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 8 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 7 ofSS 
filed by The Estate lists Poplar, Inc. as holding title to Great St. James. Thus, Poplar, Inc. 
participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes. 
33. 
Defendant, Plan D, LLC is a limited liability company established and organized 
under the laws of the Virgin Islands. In its original Articles of Organization, filed October 19, 
2012, and Annual Report filings, Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski. was listed as Plan D, LLC's sole 
manager/member. However, the July 31, 2019 Annual Report revealed Epstein as the principal 
behind Plan D, LLC. 
34. 
Upon infonnation and belief, Plan D, LLC owns one or more of the airplanes and 
helicopters that Epstein used to transport young women and children to and from the Virgin Islands 
to carry out the criminal pattern of activity described below. Among the airplanes owned by Plan 
D, LLC is a Gulfstream with N-number N212JE. Flight logs and travel notices indicate that 
Epstein used this plane to traffic and transport and young women and underage girls to the Virgin 
Islands. 
35. 
Defendant, Hyperion Air, LLC is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands on October 19, 2012. Jeffrey Epstein is a 
manager/member of Hyperion Air, LLC, along with his pilot, Larry Visoski. The purpose of 
Hyperion Air, LLC is listed in its Annual Report as "holding assets." 
36. 
Hyperion Air, LLC is the registered owner of a Bell helicopter with N-number 
N331JE and a Keystone helicopter with N-number N722JE. Upon information and belief, Epstein 
used these helicopters to transport young women and underage girls between St. Thomas and Little 
St. James. 
37. 
Defendant Southern Trust Company, Inc. was originally incorporated in the Virgin 
Islands on November 18, 2011 as Financial Informatics, Inc., but changed its name to Southern 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 9 of 55

Page 8 of55 
Trust Company in September 2012. Southern Trust Company is a tenant at American Yacht 
Harbor in Red Hook, St. Thomas, and Epstein is a '·passive investor" in IG Y-A YH, d/b/a American 
Yacht Harbor. By the end of 2013, according to its corporate filings, Southern Trust Company 
has assets of $198.5 million; four years later, its assets reached $391.3 million. From 2011 until 
at least 2018, Jeffrey Epstein was the President/Director of Southern Trust Company, and 
Defendants Kahn and Indyke were Treasurer/Director and Secretary/Director, respectively. 
Epstein was the sole owner of Southern Trust Company. 
38. 
John and Jane Does represent individuals and entities whose identities or 
involvement with Epstein are currently unknown. The Government of the Virgin Islands will 
amend the Complaint to add these individuals and entities when discovered. 
39. 
The Attorney General brings this action to seek all remedies available to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands in enforcing its laws and protecting the public interest and public 
safety. These claims are distinct from, and are not intended to supplant, the claims of victims who 
were unconscionably hanned by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. The Conduct of the "Epstein Enterprise" in the Virgin Islands 
40. 
Epstein and his associates, including Defendants, identified and recruited female 
victims, including children, and transported them to the Virgin Islands where they were abused 
and injured. Epstein, through and in association with Defendants, trafficked, raped, sexually 
assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women at his properties in the Virgin Islands. 
41. 
Epstein created a network of companies and individuals who participated in and 
conspired with him in a pattern of criminal activity related to the sex trafficking, forced labor, 
sexual assault, child abuse, and sexual servitude of these young women and children. Epstein and 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 10 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 9 of 55 
his associates trafficked underage girls to the Virgin Islands, held them captive, and sexually 
abused them, causing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury. 
42. 
To accomplish his illegal ends, Epstein fonned an association in fact with multiple 
Defendants and others (both companies and individuals) who were willing to participate in, 
facilitate, and conceal Epstein's criminal activity in exchange for Epstein's bestowal of financial 
and other benefits, including sexual services and forced labor from victims. 
43. 
This illicit association of Epstein, Defendants, and his associates constitute what is 
referred to herein as the '"Epstein Enterprise." Epstein's associates in the Epstein Enterprise, 
including, but not limited to, those named as Defendants knowingly facilitated, participated in, and 
concealed Epstein's illegal conduct. 
44. 
Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise which engaged 
in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands by repeatedly procuring and subjecting 
underage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and forced labor. 
45. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin 
Islands (and elsewhere) with the criminal purpose and goal of placing a steady supply of vulnerable 
female children and young women into sexual servitude in service of Epstein's desires, and those 
of his associates. The Epstein Enterprise maintained and made available young women and 
underage girls for the purpose of engaging them in forced labor and sexual activities and used 
coercion and deception to procure, abuse, and harbor its victims. 
46. 
Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019 the Epstein 
Enterprise transported underage girls and young women to the Virgin Islands, who were then taken 
via helicopter or private vessel to Little St. James where they were then deceptively subjected to 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 11 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 10 of55 
sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and 
forced labor. 
47. 
In furtherance of its criminal activities, the Epstein Enterprise used its aircrafts to 
transport the young women and underage girls to the Virgin Islands for purposes of sexual abuse 
and exploitation. 
48. 
The Epstein Enterprise facilitated and participated in the sexual molestation and 
exploitation of numerous girls between the age of 12 and 17 years old. 
49. 
On the pretext of providing modeling opportunities, careers and contracts, 
associates of the Epstein Enterprise, funded by the Epstein Enterprise, lured and recruited young 
women and underage girls to travel to locations including the Virgin Islands where, upon 
information and belief, based on the pattern and practice of the Epstein Enterprise, they were 
sexually abused and exploited. 
50. 
Associates in the Epstein Enterprise recruited both victims and abusers into the 
Epstein Enterprise, participated in sexual acts of rape and abuse of minors and witnessed Epstein 
and others engage in sexual acts with children. 
51. 
As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing 
Epstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age of 11 and 
18 years. 
52. 
Upon information and belief, based on Epstein's pattern of trafficking and sexually 
abusing young girls, the Epstein Enterprise trafficked and abused these girls, and others, in the 
Virgin Islands through 2018. 
53. 
When sued in civil court for committing sex trafficking and sex crimes, Epstein 
never denied engaging in sexual acts with underage females and procuring underage females for 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 12 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 11 of 55 
prostitution, but instead consistently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination. 
54. 
Upon infonnation and belief, the Epstein Enterprise kept a computerized list of 
underage girls who were in or proximate to the Virgin Islands, and able to be transported to 
Epstein's residence at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. 
55. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct by trafficking 
children and young women and placing them in sexual servitude and forced labor in the Virgin 
Islands. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 133 to I 38, which prohibit 
trafficking and sexual abuse. The Epstein Enterprise also repeatedly violated laws against child 
abuse and neglect, including 14 V.1.C. § 505, which defines the crime of child abuse as knowingly 
or recklessly causing "·a child to suffer physical, mental, or emotional injury," or causing a child 
to be placed in a situation where such injury is foreseeable, and 14 V.I.C. § 506, which applies, as 
here, where the child suffers serious physical, mental, or emotional injury as a result of that abuse. 
The harm to Epstein's victims was both fully foreseeable and deeply damaging. 
56. 
The Epstein Enterprise knowingly recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, 
received, procured, obtained, isolated, maintained, and enticed young women and girls to engage 
in forced labor (such as providing massages) and, ultimately, sexual servitude at his little St. James 
residence. 
57. 
A 15 year old victim was forced into sexual acts with Epstein and others and then 
attempted to escape by swimming off the Little St. James island. Epstein and others organized a 
search party that located her and kept her captive by, among other things, confiscating her passport. 
58. 
Another victim, who was first engaged in provide massages to Epstein, was then 
forced to perform sexual acts at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. When she attempted to 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 13 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 12 ofSS 
escape from the "private island," Epstein and a search party found her, returned her to his house, 
and suggested physical restraint or hann if she failed to cooperate. 
59. 
The Epstein Enterprise deceptively lured underage girls and women into its sex 
trafficking ring with money and promises of employment, career opportunities and school 
assistance. 
The Epstein Enterprise preyed on their financial and other vulnerabilities, and 
promised victims money, shelter, gifts, employment, tuition and other items of value. 
For 
example, participants in the Epstein Enterprise targeted young and underage females under the 
pretext that they would be paid substantially merely to provide massages to him and others. 
However, once drawn in, victims were then pressured and coerced to engage in sexual acts. 
60. 
The Epstein Enterprise forced underage victims to recruit others to perform services 
and engage in sexual acts-a trafficking pyramid scheme. 
61. 
The Epstein Enterprise paid girls for each "meeting,'' with additional money if they 
brought additional girls. Epstein reportedly required three meetings per day. 
62. 
The Epstein Enterprise used the term "work'' as a code for sexual abuse, and, upon 
information and belief, reportedly kept computer records of the contact information for the victims. 
63. 
Consistent with his creation and use of a complex web of entities to carry out and 
conceal the criminal trafficking enterprise in the Virgin islands, the Epstein Enterprise sometimes 
paid young women and underage girls he exploited and trafficked through his charitable 
foundations. 
64. 
Once the girls and women were recruited, participants in the Epstein Enterprise 
enforced their sexual servitude of victims by coercion, including but not limited to, confiscating 
passports, controlling and extinguishing external communications, and threatening violence. They 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 14 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 13 of 55 
also made fraudulent statements to family members of victims, claiming victims were being well 
cared for and supported financially in college and other educational opportunities. 
65. 
The Epstein Enterprise transported, held, sexually abused, trafficked, and 
concealed women and children at his property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times over nearly 
two decades. 
B. The "Epstein Enterprise" Abused Privileges of Residency to Carry out its 
Criminal Scheme 
66. 
The Epstein Enterprise in 1998 acquired Little St. James in the Virgin Islands as 
the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual 
servitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St: James is a secluded, private island, nearly two 
miles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or helicopter; 
no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the island, and no 
bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the 
private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and 
children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permission and 
assistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. 
67. 
In 2016, upon information and belief, using a straw purchaser to hide Epstein's 
identity, the Epstein Enterprise acquired Great St. James the nearest island to Little St. James. By 
then, Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise 
purchased the island for more than $20 million because its participants wanted to ensure that the 
island did not become a base from which others could view their activities or visitors. By acquiring 
ownership and control of Great St. James to the exclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 15 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 14 of 55 
additional barriers to prevent those held involuntarily on Little St. James from escaping or 
obtaining help from others. 
68. 
Great St. James and Little St. James are environmentally sensitive locations, with 
native coral and wildlife protected by federal and territorial law and enforcement authorities. The 
Department of Planning and Natural Resources ("DPNR'') regulates and monitors construction in 
the Coastal Zone to protect, maintain and manage the precious natural resources of the Virgin 
Islands. Under its authority, DPNR repeatedly issued citations and assessed thousands of dollars 
of fines for violations of the Virgin Islands construction code and environmental protection laws 
on both Little St. James and Great St. James-significant penalties to the agency and to the average 
resident of the Virgin Islands. But because of Epstein· s enormous wealth, these fines had little 
effect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's unlawful conduct or conforming its activities 
to the law. 
69. 
As a result of illegal construction activity of the Epstein Enterprise, the Virgin 
Islands has incurred, and will incur, significant expenses to remove the illegal construction or 
remediate its effects on natural resources in and around Little St. James and Great St. James. The 
extent of the potential environmental damage is unknown at this time as the illegal construction 
has not been removed or remediated. 
70. 
The Epstein Enterprise continues to attempt to prevent or limit DPNR authorities 
from conducting random inspections on the Little St. James and Great St. James necessary to 
comply with Virgin Islands law. 
71. 
The Epstein Enterprise's violation of the construction and environmental laws was 
part of a pattern of behavior in flouting the laws of the Virgin Islands and holding itself above the 
law. 
Upon information and belief, as described above, the Epstein Enterprise undertook 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 16 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 15 of 55 
construction at Great St. James after 2016 to continue the scheme to carry out and conceal his 
trafficking and sexual abuse of young women and children in the Virgin Islands. These actions 
are also indicative of the Epstein Enterprise's disregard for Virgin Islands' law. The Epstein 
Enterprise used the Virgin Islands' land, resources, people, and laws for its illicit purposes. Rather 
than participating lawfully in this community, the Epstein Enterprise took advantage of the 
secluded nature of the islands in furtherance of its crimes. 
72. 
As a result of its deplorable and unlawful conduct, the Epstein Enterprise has 
subjected the Virgin Islands to public portrayals as a hiding place for human trafficking and sex

C. The "Epstein Enterprise" Fraudulently Concealed its Conduct 
73. 
The Epstein Enterprise fraudulently concealed its actions to prevent detection by 
the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
74. 
The secluded properties at Little St. James and Great St. James were repeatedly 
used by the Epstein Enterprise as the locations for unlawfully soliciting, transporting, transferring, 
harboring, receiving, providing, isolating, patronizing, maintaining, deceiving, coercing, and 
sexually abusing young women and children and concealing these crimes. 
75. 
The Epstein Enterprise was able to hide the trafficking ring from law enforcement, 
despite the fact that Epstein was a registered sex offender. Given the isolation of the Little St. 
James and Great St. James and the nature of the crimes and of the victims targeted by the Epstein 
Enterprise, the activities of the Epstein Enterprise were not readily detectable. Moreover, Epstein's 
great wealth and power likely made witnesses reluctant to report their observations to the local law 
enforcement.

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 16 of 55 
76. 
Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise prevented its employees from 
cooperating with law enforcement. Employees and others were required to sign confidentiality 
agreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing infonnation with law enforcement. If 
they were contacted by law enforcement they were to notify the Epstein Enterprise and be 
represented by Epstein's counsel. 
77. 
The employees were directed not to communicate or interact with guests visiting 
Little St. James and were also directed not to disclose to anyone events that occurred on the island. 
78. 
Monitoring a sex offender with his own private islands and the resources to fly 
victims in and out on private planes and helicopters presented unique challenges and allowed the 
Epstein Enterprise to limit scrutiny by the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
79. 
Sexual Offender Registration and Community Protection Act ("SORCPA") 14 
V .LC. § 1721, et. seq. requires sex offenders to register in their resident jurisdictions and to make 
periodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information. 
80. 
Epstein renewed his registration each year in the Virgin Islands. In addition, 
beyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited--or attempted to visit-
Little St. James to conduct additional address verifications. 
81. 
At his last verification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, to enter Little St. James 
beyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his "front door." Instead, Epstein arranged to be met 
at his office on St. Thomas. 
82. 
Epstein also misled the Government regarding his travel plans. On March 19, 2019, 
the Virgin Islands was notified that Epstein would be traveling to France for 10 days on the private 
plane owned by Plan D, LLC. His notification form did not disclose travel to any other countries. 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 18 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 17 of 55 
It was later found by law enforcement authorities that Epstein also travelled to Vienna and Monaco 
during that trip. 
83. 
Similarly, the Epstein Enterprise sought to prevent DPNR from conducting routine 
site visits to inspect unpermitted and potentially damaging construction activity on Great St. James. 
The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly objected to DPNR' s inspections referring to them as "invasions" 
of Epstein's constitutional right to privacy in his home, which he described defined as the entire 
island. These DPNR inspections are required for all construction and Virgin Islands residents are 
required to cooperate with the inspections to assure compliance with the law throughout the 
construction phases. 
84. 
These efforts represent Epstein Enterprise's intent to conceal its unlawful activity 
on Little St. James and Great St. James. 
85. 
The Epstein Enterprise also created numerous corporations and limited liability 
companies in the Virgin Islands to help conceal its unlawful activity. Most of these companies 
were created in 2011 and 2012, soon after Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands. 
86. 
Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski is identified as member or co-member in companies 
that serviced and maintained the planes that the Epstein Enterprise used to traffick young women 
and children - Freedom Air Petroleum, LLC (registered November 28, 2011 to hold assets); and 
JEGE, LLC (registered October 19, 2012 to hold assets). 
87. 
Other Epstein entities include LSJ Employees, LLC (registered October 27, 2011 
to provide services); Southern Financial, LLC (registered February 25, 2013 to provide services) 
and LSJ Emergency, LLC (registered December 2, 2015 to provide services). 
88. 
Some of these companies held considerable assets: Financial Informatics, Inc. 
(incorporated November 18, 2011, also known as Southern Trust Company, Inc.) had assets of 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 19 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 18 of 55 
approximately $391 million in 2015; and Financial Trust Company, Inc. (incorporated November 
6, 1998) had assets of $212 million when it publicly filed its last balance sheet in 2012. 
89. 
Though often absent in the original incorporation or registration documents or 
annual filings, Epstein ultimately appeared as president, director, manager, or sole member of each 
of these companies. Upon infonnation and belief, the purpose of this complex array of corporate 
entities-some of which may still be discovered-was to allow Epstein to shelter his assets in 
order to fund, carry out, and conceal his identity and pattern of criminal conduct. 
90. 
The Estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the 
criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise. On November 24, 2019, Epstein's Estate filed an 
Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program in the Superior 
Court of the Virgin Islands. ('·Motion··). According to the Motion, the proposed program was to 
be designed to "establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program for purposes of 
resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein." (Motion, at l). 
91. 
The program proposed by the Estate, whose executors are trustees of The 1953 
Trust and officers in at least two Epstein entities, imposes confidentiality requirements and 
requires any claimant accepting an award under the program to sacrifice any other claims against 
"any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. Epstein's conduct." (Motion, at 5). It acts to 
conceal the criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise and shield its participants from liability 
and accountability for the injury they caused to the victims. 
92. 
Two days before his death, Epstein amended The Trust and his Last Will and 
Testament. Upon information and belief, he did so, as part of a pattern and ongoing effort to 
conceal and shield his assets from potential recovery by claimants.

D. The "Epstein Enterprise" Violated Numerous Virgin Islands Laws 
93. 
The pattern of criminal activity engaged in by Epstein and other participants in the 
Epstein Enterprise violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 605 and 607 of the Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act ("CICO"). 
94. 
The Epstein Enterprise also violated Title 14, Chapter 3A, The Virgin Islands 
Unifonn Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act relating to Trafficking of 
Persons; Title 14, Chapter 24, relating to Child Protection and Child Abuse and Neglect; Title 14, 
Chapter 81, relating to Prostitution and Related Offenses; Title 18, Chapter 85, relating to Rape 
and Sexual Assault and other related offenses, as well as other Virgin Islands laws. 
95. 
The Epstein Enterprise violated Virgin Islands laws by engaging in the human 
trafficking of underage girls and young women and commercial sex with young women and 
underage girls by force, fraud, enticement, or coercion, which serve as predicates to the Epstein 
Enterprise's violations of CICO. 
96. 
Certain participants who recruited women and underage girls to be trafficked and 
forced into sexual servitude themselves were sexually trafficked and abused by the Epstein 
Enterprise and may be afforded the protections of 14 V.I.C. § 145. 
97. 
Specifically, Plan D, LLC knowingly and intentionally facilitated the trafficking 
scheme by flying underage girls and young women into the Virgin Islands to be delivered into 
sexual servitude. 
Plan D LLC repeatedly made flights from the mainland to St. Thomas with 
Epstein and underage girls and young women for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity on 
Little St. James. 
On some occasions, they would transport Epstein and female children by 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 21 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 20 of 55 
helicopter to Little St. James. On other occasions, Epstein and the young women and girls would 
be transported by boat. 
98. 
Great St. Jim, LLC and Nautilus, Inc. knowingly participated in the Epstein 
Enterprise and facilitated the trafficking and sexual servitude of young women and underage girls 
by providing the secluded properties at, from, or to which Epstein and his associates were able to 
transport, transfer, receive, maintain, isolate, harbor, provide, entice, deceive, coerce, and sexually 
abuse underage girls and young women. 
99. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a continuing course of unlawful conduct. 
I 00. 
After Epstein's suicide, the Epstein Enterprise continued to exist as each of the 
participants continued to conspire to prevent detection of the breadth and scope of the Epstein 
Enterprise's criminal wrongdoing and to prevent accountability. These conspiratorial acts are 
ongoing. 
I 01. 
The conduct of the Epstein Enterprise offends the core purpose of the Virgin Islands 
Unifonn Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act, 14 V.I.C. §131 et seq, and 
violates CICO, enacted to "curtail criminal activity and lessen its economic and political power in 
the Territory of the Virgin Islands by establishing new penal prohibitions and providing to law 
enforcement and the victims of criminal activity new civil sanctions and remedies." 14 V.I.C. § 
601. 
102. 
The Epstein Enterprise is an illicit enterprise within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. §§ 
604 and 605. 
103. 
The Government is entitled to recover civil penalties, damages and other remedies 
and to extinguish and recoup from the Epstein Enterprise any and all financial and other benefits, 
and any personal and real property that was used during the course of, or intended for use in the 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 22 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 21 of 55 
course of the conduct or criminal activity in violation of the laws of the Virgin Islands. The 
Government is entitled to obtain through divestiture, forfeiture, or other equitable relief all 
properties and instrumentalities used by the Epstein Enterprise in the criminal pattern of trafficking 
and sexual abuse in the Virgin Islands, including but not limited to Great St. James and Little St. 
James, and all other remedies and penalties permitted by law in the interest of justice. 
E. The Epstein Enterprise Used Corporate Entities to Defraud the Government and 
Fund its Criminal Activities 
104. 
In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company applied for economic benefits from 
the Economic Development Commission ("EDC''). The EDC is a subsidiary of the Virgin Islands 
Economic Development Authority ("EDA"), a semi-autonomous governmental instrumentality 
created and governed pursuant to 29 VIC§ 1101. 
I 05. 
In sworn testimony at a public hearing on the tax incentive application conducted 
by the EDC on November 15, 2012, Epstein and his attorney, Ericka Kellerhals, described 
Southern Trust Company as providing ''cutting edge consulting services'' in the area of 
"biomedical and financial informatics." 
106. 
The EDC granted Southern Trust Company a 10-year package of economic 
incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% exemption 
from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and withholding taxes in the 
Virgin Islands. 
107. 
Between 2013 and 2019, Southern Trust Company employed 13 different 
individuals (not including Epstein). Of those 13 individuals, 11 served in administrative or support 
roles: six as personal, administrative, or executive assistants, receptionists, or as a driver/helper, 
one as an office manager, one as a clerk, and three in accounting or payroll functions (though only 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 23 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 22 of 55 
one was licensed as a certified public accountant). There was one network administrator/IT 
manager, and a second who was added in 2019. 
108. 
In fact, several of those individuals seemed to perfonn other personal services for 
Jeffrey Epstein. Though he was reported by Southern Trust Company to be resident of the Virgin 
Islands, the network administrator/IT manager was issued a Florida driver's license, which listed 
an address in Miami. Further, he appears, in fact, to have served as Epstein's driver and picked up 
luggage and cargo from Epstein's private planes on his behalf. 
109. 
Another executive assistant lived at 301 E. 66th Street, Apartment 11 B, New York, 
New York. Epstein's address book lists units various units in this building as providing "Apt. for 
models" and she is publicly identified as a model. As noted above, the Epstein Enterprise used 
modeling opportunities and contracts as a pretext for recruiting underage girls and young women 
into its sex trafficking scheme. 
110. 
During several time periods, Southern Trust Company affinned to EDC that it had 
no employees who were non-residents, even though it employed non-residents. 
111. 
Despite having only one full-time employee working on infonnation technology 
during the bulk of the period, Southern Trust Company reportedly generated net income of $50.3 
million in 2013, $67 .5 million in 2014, $52.8 million in 2015, and $4.8 million in 2016 and $17 .1 
million in 2017, with aggregate income of $117.8 million in 2014, $170.6 million in 2015, $175.3 
million in 2016 and $192.4 million in 2017, or aggregate income for the period of $656 million. 
112. 
For the period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017, Southern Trust 
Company received tax exemptions totaling $73.6 million. 
113. 
As of December 31, 201 7, Southern Trust Company, Inc. elected to file its income 
tax as an S-corporation, which elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credits 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 24 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 23 of55 
through to its sole shareholder-Jeffrey Epstein-for tax purposes. For this time period, Epstein's 
income tax exemption was $71.3 million. 
114. 
Based upon these facts, it is clear that Southern Trust Company did not perfonn the 
•'inforn1atics" business represented to the EDC and could not have generated the business income 
attributable to that business. Instead, upon information and belief, Southern Trust Company 
existed to secure tax benefits for Epstein, to employ individuals associated with the Epstein 
Enterprise, and to provide a source of income to support his criminal activities and properties in 
the Virgin Islands.

Notice of Allegation of 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES 
307. 
The purpose of punitive damages in the common law is to punish the defendant 
for outrageous conduct that is reckless or intentional and to deter others from engaging in such 
conduct in the future.

This Complaint describes intentional conduct so egregious, persistent, and injurious 
that it shocks the conscience and offends a civilized society.

have so money, assets, and power that mere fines, penalties, and economic damages are simply 
not sufficient. 
310. 
At all times material herein, Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise engaged repeatedly 
in wrongful acts which were intentional and outrageous. The Government gives notice that it 
intends to pursue the possibility of punitive damages in any jury verdict.
