IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
JANE DOE No. I 01, 
Civil Action No. 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 101, by and through her undersigned counsel, moves this Court to 
enter an Order granting Plaintiff permission to proceed in this action under the pseudonym "Jane 
Doe No. 101" and, as grounds, states as follows: 
I. 
As outlined in detail in the Complaint, Jane Doe No. 101 was sexually abused by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, when she was under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a result of Defendant's sexual abuse, Plaintiff has in the past suffered, and will 
in the future suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and/or 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss of educational 
oppottunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy, and other damages 
associated with Defendant's manipulating and leading her into a perverse and unhealthy way of 
life. 
3. 
Disclosure of Plaintiffs name would cause her much additional embarrassment, 
humiliation, and psychological tratuna.

4. 
The subject matter of the Complaint clearly contains highly sensitive and intimate 
information about Plaintiff. 
5. 
Plaintiff was an identified victim by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in a 
criminal investigation against Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. 
6. 
During the related criminal investigation, and up and to this point in time, 
Plaintiffs identity has been sealed, as all parties recognize the highly sensitive subject matter of 
the charges and the need to protect the privacy interest of Plaintiffs identity. 
7. 
In this civil action, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, already knows Plaintiffs identity 
and will be privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiffs name. Therefore, he knows the 
identity of Plaintiff and will not be prejudiced by public non-disclosure of Jane Doe No. 101 's 
identity. 
8. 
There is great need, in this case, to protect intimate information about Plaintiff, 
Jane Doe No. 101, and to protect her privacy interest. 
Memorandum of Law 
The general presumption against anonymous or pseudonymous pleadings is commonly 
overcome in certain types of cases, and courts have discretion to permit such pleading in 
appropriate circumstances. "[P]rivacy or confidentiality concerns are sometimes sufficiently 
critical that parties or witnesses should be allowed this rare dispensation." James v. Jacobson, 6 
F.3d 233, 238 ( 4th Cir. 1993). As is ordinarily the case where trial courts have discretion, 
judicial guidelines exist for the exercise of such discretion in the form of factors that courts 
should consider in deciding whether to grant anonymity requests. They are not many, for the 
question happily is one that is seldom raised. Nevertheless, some guidelines can be gleaned from 
the relatively few cases-both at the trial and appellate levels-that have wrestled with the 
problem. Among them are the following that have relevance to this case: whether the

justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid the annoyance and criticism that 
may attend any litigation or to preserve privacy in a matter of sensitive and highly personal 
nature; whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the 
requesting party or, even more critically, to innocent non-parties; the ages of the persons whose 
privacy interests are sought to be protected; and, relatedly, the risk of unfairness to the opposing 
party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously. See id. (internal citations 
omitted). 
In deciding whether to permit pseudonymous pleadings, courts must balance "the 
plaintiffs right to privacy and security against the dual concerns of (1) public interest in 
identification oflitigants and (2) harm to the defendant stemming from [suppression] of 
plaintiffs name." Doe v. Smith, 105 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (internal citation 
omitted). The ultimate test for permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the 
plaintiff has a substantial privacy right that outweighs the customary presumption of openness in 
judicial proceedings. See Doe v. Stegall, 653 F .2d 180, 185-86 ( 5th Cir. August 10, 1981 ). 
Courts typically accept pseudonym filing in cases where the nature of the pleading unveils highly 
sensitive information and detail about the plaintiff, such that the non-disclosure of the party's 
name is necessary to protect her from harassment, injury, ridicule, or personal embarrassment. 
See United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920,922 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981); see also Doe v. Smith, 429 F.3d 
706 (7th Cir. 2005) ( court required to consider whether the interests of justice required adult 
woman, who was videotaped having consensual sex with her boyfriend when she was a minor, to 
disclose her name as plaintiff in lawsuit against boyfriend alleging that boyfriend illegally 
distributed videotape); Does I ThruXXlllv. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68 
(9th Cir. 2000) ( district court abused its discretion in denying permission to proceed

employees were vulnerable to retaliation); Stegall, 653 F.2d at 185-86 (anonymity warranted to 
protect minor plaintiffs against risk of violence from revelation of unpopular personal beliefs); 
Doe v. United Servs. Life Ins. Co., 123 F.R.D. 437 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (anonymity allowed because 
of sensitive privacy and retaliation concerns in suit by homosexual against insurance company 
alleging discriminatory practices; no unfairness to defendant, who was aware of claimant's 
identity); Candy H v. Redemption Ranch, 563 F. Supp. 505 (M.D. Ala. 1983) (anonymity 
allowed in suit by pregnant 19-year-old alleging fraudulent inducement to enter defendant's 
Home for Girls). 
It is clear from the allegations of sexual abuse of a minor in the Complaint that the 
information is of a highly sensitive nature. Jane Doe No. 101 's name remained anonymous in 
the related criminal case, and Defendant's attorneys, as well as the United States government, 
redacted all documents containing her name. The present case is not one in which permitting 
Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will disadvantage Defendant in any way. Defendant already 
knows Plaintiff's identity and will be privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiffs name. 
While the public normally has a right to the openness of judicial proceedings, the victim's 
privacy interest greatly outweighs the right to know the identity of a victim of child sex abuse. 
Other than the identity of Plaintiff, the aspects of this case will be available to the public. 
Evidently, the balance weighs overwhelmingly in favor of allowing Plaintiff to proceed 
anonymously. 
This Court recently has allowed at least ten other plaintiffs who were underage sex abuse 
victims of Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, to proceed anonymously. See C.M.A. v. Epstein et al., 
Case No. 9:08-cv-80811-KAM; Jane Doe No. 1 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-cv-80069-KAM; 
Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM; Jane Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, Case No. 
9:08-cv-800232; Jane Doe No. 4 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-cv-80380-KAM; Jane Doe No. 5 v.

Doe No. 101 to proceed anonymously. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 101, moves this Court to enter an Order granting 
this Motion, thus allowing her to proceed in this litigation under the Jane Doe No. 101 
pseudonym.
