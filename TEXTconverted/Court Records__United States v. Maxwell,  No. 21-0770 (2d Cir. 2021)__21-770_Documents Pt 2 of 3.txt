THE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO THE DEFENDANT’S 
RENEWED MOTION FOR RELEASE 
 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s 
renewed motion for release on bail, dated December 8, 2020 (the “Renewed Bail Motion”).  Five 
months ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the 
defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could 
ensure her appearance in court.  The defense now asks this Court to reverse that finding by 
essentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package.  However, 
at the July 14, 2020 bail hearing in this case, this Court rejected the defendant’s request to keep 
the record open to allow the defendant to do precisely what she has done here—namely, present 
more detailed information about her finances and a more concrete package—determining that 
further information about her financial picture would be irrelevant because no combination of 
conditions could ensure this defendant’s appearance.  The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct, 
and the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it.  The offense conduct outlined in the 
Indictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the 
defendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 4 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page5 of 165

demonstrated ability to live in hiding for the long term.  In short, the defendant poses an extreme 
flight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this 
District, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect. 
BACKGROUND 
 
As detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of 
multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997.  The defendant 
played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage 
in sex acts with Epstein.  The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s 
abusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse.  Together, the 
defendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences 
in different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and 
subjection to sexual abuse.  Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath 
during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.   
Based on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts.  Count One 
charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage 
in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Two charges the defendant with enticing 
a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.  Count 
Three charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to 
participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Four charges the defendant 
with transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.  
Counts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.

On July 2, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.  
Following extensive briefing, on July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing.  In its written 
and oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.   
Among other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in 
the United States (Dkt. 18 at 2, 3, 12), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the 
defendant (Id. at 20), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the 
Government through counsel following Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. 18 at 12-13; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued 
that the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. 18 at 14-16; Tr. 55-56), and 
argued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69).  Responding 
to the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and 
six proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if 
the Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail 
determination.  (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are 
insufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and 
confidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be 
able to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for 
purposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does 
not affect the analysis.  That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires 
it, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to 
leave the proceeding open for a week and allow us to come back, if the court has concerns about 
the number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues, 
we think that, now that we have some ability to breathe a little bit, that we should be able to pull 
this together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 70 (“And if the court needs more information 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 6 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page7 of 165

from us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that 
we can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).   
The Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a 
serious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.  First, the 
Court found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,” 
given the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the 
potential penalties those charges carry.  (Tr. 82).  Second, the Court determined that “[t]he 
government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple 
victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well 
as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.”  (Id.).  
Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the 
defendant poses a risk of flight.  (Tr. 83). 
In addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial 
international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,” including “multiple foreign 
citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of 
significant value.”  (Tr. 83).  The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a 
nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.”  (Id.).  The Court further found that the 
defendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to 
Pretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid 
picture of the resources available.”  (Tr. 83-84).   
Although the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal 
connections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents, 
significant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page8 of 165

5 
 
would not pose an insurmountable burden for her.”  (Tr. 84).  The Court recognized the defense 
arguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in 
contact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have 
expected that she would not be prosecuted.  (Tr. 84-85).  The Court also noted that the defendant 
“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest 
. . . may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that 
she makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may 
face such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.”  (Tr. 85).  
Based on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of 
demonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”  (Tr. 86).  
The Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be 
insufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance.  (Id.).  Acknowledging that the defense’s initial 
bail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a 
substantially larger package would be insufficient.”  (Id.).  Although the defendant “apparently 
failed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the 
Court implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that 
“[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be 
appropriate.”  (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)).  That conclusion was informed not only by the 
defendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding 
those resources and herself.”  (Tr. 87).  “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide 
from the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct 
underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has 
acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.”  (Id.).  Given that sophistication, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 8 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page9 of 165

the Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient” 
because the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards.  (Tr. 87-88).  Finally, 
the Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-19 and the difficulty of 
preparing a defense with an incarcerated client.  In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant 
has no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-19 
and emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial.  (Tr. 89-90). 
 
Viewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending 
trial.  (Tr. 91). 
APPLICABLE LAW 
 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of 
flight.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).  When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the 
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual 
risk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the 
defendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’”  United States v. Boustani, 932 
F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007)).  The 
Bail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government 
seeks detention based on flight risk: (1) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) 
the weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the 
defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.”  See 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(g).  If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will 
reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the 
detention of the person before trial.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 9 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page10 of 165

Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with committing an offense involving 
a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, that no 
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as 
required and the safety of the community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E).  In such a case, “the 
defendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut 
that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”  
United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 
254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001)).  The act of producing such evidence, however, “does not 
eliminate the presumption favoring detention.”  Id.  Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to 
be considered among those weighed by the district court,” while the Government retains the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight.  Mercedes, 254 F.3d 
at 436. 
When the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the 
detention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was 
not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of 
whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the 
defendant.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an attempt to reopen 
a detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”  
United States v. Petrov, 15 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 
2015).  Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered 
even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the 
original hearing,” United States v. Rowe, 02 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 
May 21, 2003), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 10 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 165

8 
 
reconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or 
incorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”  
Petrov, 2015 WL 1102286 at *3. 
DISCUSSION  
 
Having already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial 
bail hearing in this case, the defense now asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the 
same arguments it already rejected.  The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same 
claims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest 
that the Court already found unpersuasive.  To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents 
new information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly known to the defendant 
at the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made 
available (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention.  Ultimately, nothing in the 
Renewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant 
“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her 
appearance.  (Tr. 86).  All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor 
of detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-
reasoned and thorough prior decision. 
A. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense 
The first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case.  The 
egregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and 
the Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature 
and circumstances of the offense support detention.  The charges in the Indictment describe 
horrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims.  If convicted, the

defendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her 
natural life in prison.  The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility 
upon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the 
chance.   
In light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have 
asked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.  
Additionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a written 
statement urging the Court to deny bail, which is attached as Exhibit A hereto.  That unanimous 
view of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of 
detention.  First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to 
evade justice.  Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s 
conduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy 
sentence.  Third, as discussed further below, the victims’ attention to this case and willingness to 
convey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial, 
demonstrating the strength of the Government’s case. 
In short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order. 
B. The Strength of the Evidence 
Further incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong.  As 
the Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July 14, 2020 hearing, the central evidence 
in the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who 
will each independently describe how the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual 
activity with Jeffrey Epstein.  (Tr. 82).  The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts 
these victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 12 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page13 of 165

10 
 
Further, and as set forth below, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence, 
including contemporary documents and other witnesses. 
In challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.  
At the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested 
heavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago.  (See Dkt. 18 at 19; Tr. 64-65).  
Having received and reviewed the discovery, the defense now contends the Government’s 
corroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates 
defense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.1  (See Mot. at 30-
33). 
None of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor.  Three 
different victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in 
Epstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors.  As demonstrated by the information 
outlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the 
same techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in 
sex acts.  Each victim will describe how the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions 
about her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein.  Each victim will describe the 
use of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity.  Each victim will describe how the 
presence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation.  In other words, 
this is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially 
corroborating each other. 
                                                          
1 At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to 
make on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.  
After receiving discovery, the defense now appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least 
insofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 13 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page14 of 165

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page15 of 165
In addition to conoborating each other, these victims' accounts are finiher corroborated by 
other witnesses and by documentary evidence, which has been produced in discove1y. That 
evidence will make it viliually indisputable that these victims in fact met and interacted with both 
the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein at the times and locations they describe. 
Beyond this documentary 
evidence, additional witnesses will confum that both the defendant and Epstein knew and 
interacted with ce1iain minor victims when those victims were minors. In other words, the 
Government's evidence strongly conoborates the victims' testimony that they met and interacted 
with the defendant and Epstein at pariicular· times and in pariicular places. 
In the instant motion the defendant complains that the documentary evidence relevant to 
the three victims identified in the Indictment and produced to date is not sufficiently voluminous 
11 

12 
 
and that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.  
Leaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive 
sexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence.  But, as 
described above, 
 
.  To the extent other 
corroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which 
will detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein.  In other 
words, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of 
multiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses 
confirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and 
places they say they did, makes this a strong case.  (Tr. 82).   
Taken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it 
was at the time of the defendant’s arrest.  Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in 
favor of detention. 
C. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of 
dollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets, 
and a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding.  The bulk of the 
arguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims 
that this Court already considered at the July 14, 2020 hearing.  Any new information provided 
was either known by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the 
Court analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 15 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page16 of 165

13 
 
French law, is simply incorrect.  Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at 
avoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention. 
First, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties.  She is a citizen 
of three countries and holds three passports.  As was already noted at the original hearing and is 
again evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends 
who live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank 
account.  (Tr. 83).  In an attempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes 
the defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States, 
and United States citizenship.  But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its 
original detention decision.  (See Tr. 84; Dkt. 18 at 2, 12).  The letters and documentation included 
in the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute.  What that 
documentation does not do, however, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this 
country that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.  
Indeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children 
and has no current employment.  (Pretrial Services Report at 3). 
The Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that 
would prevent her from fleeing.  Although the defendant now claims her marriage would keep her 
in the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to 
Pretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the 
defendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.”  (Id.).  On this point, it bears 
noting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permitted to live with 
 if granted bail, 
not her spouse.  Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only now come forward to 
support the defendant should be afforded little weight given that he refused to come forward at the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 16 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page17 of 165

14 
 
time of her arrest.  While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s 
desire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s 
inconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her 
marriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States.3  As for the defendant’s asserted 
relationships with 
 and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not 
appear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New 
Hampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States.  In 
any event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad, 
and, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad. 
In addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further below, 
the defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition.  Attempting 
to downplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can 
irrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.  
(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V).  But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable 
waiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance 
whatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position 
on the extradition of its nationals.  (Mot. at 25).   
As an initial matter, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before 
such a waiver would even come into play.  Even assuming the defendant could be located and 
apprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and 
                                                          
3 Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established 
a trust account in or about 2018, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide 
personal information, including marital status.  On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse 
listed their marital status as “single.”  It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital 
status to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial 
Services in this case, discussed further below.

demonstrated ability to live in hiding—numerous courts have recognized that purported waivers 
of extradition are unenforceable and effectively meaningless.  See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“The Defense proposal to give advance consent to 
extradition and waiver of extradition rights is, in the Court’s view, an empty gesture.  And, it comes 
into [play] only after [the defendant] has fled the Court’s jurisdiction.”); United States v. Morrison, 
No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, 
No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug. 3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 
Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, at *7 (D. Utah Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, 
No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 
330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 2004); United States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 
1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); United States v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. 
Fla. 1985).4  For very good reason: Any defendant who signs such a purported waiver and then 
flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of the waiver, and will get to do so in 
                                                          
4 The defense argues that several courts “have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a 
foreign state that enforces extradition waiver by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver 
as a condition of release.”  (Mot. at 26).  In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved 
the release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of 
whether a waiver of extradition is enforceable.  See United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 
1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,” 
and presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to 
appeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for 
arraignment, and that his country’s government committed to ensuring his appearance at trial); 
United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (denying Government 
motion to remand after trial where court found defendant not likely to flee); United States v. Chen, 
820 F. Supp. 1205, 1209, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (reconsidering pretrial release where case had 
“taken a number of surprising turns,” including the “suppression of video evidence, the 
indeterminate stay of proceedings, the overall uncertainty of the government’s evidence”); United 
States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 133 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-1514, 
1999 WL 1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999); see also United States v. Georgiou, No. 08-1220-
M, 2008 WL 4306750, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 22, 2008) (distinguishing Cirillo on the facts and 
noting that “defense counsel concedes that a waiver of extradition may not be enforceable in 
Canada, a fact the court in Cirillo did not mention in its opinion”).

the jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee).  The Department of 
Justice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world 
that would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding.  Indeed, the defendant’s own 
experts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she 
would be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she 
could avoid extradition.   
Such an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is 
a citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States.  To confirm this fact, after 
receiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry 
of Justice (“MOJ”) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would 
extradite a French citizen to the United States.  In response, the MOJ provided the Government 
with a letter setting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite 
its citizens to the United States.  That letter in its original French, as well as an English translation 
of the letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit B.  In that letter, the MOJ makes clear that France does 
not extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual 
citizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside 
the European Union.  See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 (WHP), 2013 WL 
3802012, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins 
can avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”). 
In other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to 
France, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition.  Any purported waiver 
of extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in 
France because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 19 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page20 of 165

17 
 
to other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States.  As set forth in 
Exhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the 
extradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for 
which extradition is requested.”  (Ex. B at 3).  That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries 
is of no moment.  (See id.).  In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States 
and France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France 
systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial 
authorities.”  (Id. at 4).  Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any 
anticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be 
recognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.   
The defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French 
authorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition 
of a French citizen who was also a United States citizen.  Thus, there is no precedent to draw from 
in that regard.”  (Def. Ex. V. at 2).  That is not so.  France has previously rejected such a request.  
For example, in 2006, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in 
to French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to committing a murder in the United States.  
Despite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law 
enforcement despite the repeated requests of OIA and U.S. officials.  See Durbin, Schakowsky,

Justice on August 22, 2007 which provides that the “Ministry of Justice considers the American-
born, U.S. citizen Peterson to also be a French national and that the extradition request has been 
denied”).  Indeed, the Government is unaware of any instance in which France has ever extradited 
a French citizen to the United States.  (See Ex. B at 4 (“[T]he principle of non-extradition of 
nationals is a principle of extradition law from which France has never deviated outside the 
framework of the European Union.”)).  Simply put, the Court was correct when it determined at 
the initial bail hearing that France does not appear to extradite its own citizens.  (Tr. 83). 
The defendant’s supposed waiver of her extradition rights with respect to the United 
Kingdom should similarly be afforded no weight.  Although an anticipatory waiver of extradition 
may be admissible in extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom, such a waiver is by no means 
binding, authoritative, or enforceable.  See United States v. Stanton, No. 91 Cr. 889 (CHS), 1992 
WL 27130, at *2 & n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 1992) (denying modification of defendant’s bail where 
defendant indicated willingness to waive extradition proceeding by providing extradition waivers, 
as British authorities advised that extradition waivers were possible only in cases where the 
fugitive actually appeared before a British magistrate after the filing of an extradition request, and 
concluding that such a waiver was not an “enforceable undertaking”).  Under the United 
Kingdom’s Extradition Act of 2003, consent to extradition is permitted, “if (and only if) [a person] 
has the assistance of counsel or a solicitor to represent him in the proceedings before the 
appropriate judge.”  Extradition Act 2003, § 127(9), https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/ 
2003/41.  As such, a judge in the United Kingdom must independently evaluate any waiver of 
extradition in real time, thereby necessarily rendering any anticipatory waiver executed before the 
defendant is found in the United Kingdom meaningless.  Id. at §127.  In other words, consent given 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 21 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page22 of 165

19 
 
to authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant 
could easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.   
Further, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition 
based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of 
time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.  See, e.g., id. at 
§§ 82, 83A, & 91.  Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary 
of State still has the discretion to deny extradition.  See id. at § 93.  The Government understands 
from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain, 
and subject to multiple levels of appeal.  Moreover, even where the process is ultimately 
successful, it is lengthy and time-consuming. 
Ultimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge 
being extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the 
United Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries.  And, of 
course, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with 
which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.  The defendant’s written waivers of 
extradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant 
will not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be 
impossible.  Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a 
defendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants 
pending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2000 WL 1872012, at *2 (6th Cir. 
Dec. 12, 2000); Cilins, 2013 WL 3802012 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433, 
443 (D.N.J. 2007) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of 
detention.”).  Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 22 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 165

20 
 
complicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims 
who would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.  The strong possibility that the 
defendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.  
Second, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her 
sophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection.  The Court noted as much in denying 
bail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion.  (Tr. 87).  
Indeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even 
to the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut 
herself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding.  She did so by purchasing a home 
using a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing 
her assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card 
under other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.   
The Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media 
frenzy that followed Epstein’s death.  (Tr. 44, 56-57).  However, as the Court already recognized, 
regardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly 
establishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family 
and friends in order to avoid detection.  (Tr. 87).  Rare is the case when a defendant has already 
demonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when 
purchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances.  Here, the defendant has 
indisputably taken all of those steps.  She was able to do so because of both her finances and her 
willingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.  
And she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and

the media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were 
searching for her.   
The charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s 
skill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that 
the defense already made at the prior hearing.  (See Dkt. 18 at 14-16).  That said, there is still 
reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law 
enforcement.  It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government, 
never disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged.  (Tr. 
53-54).  The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in 
the year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new 
on that score.  (Id.).  Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI attempted to serve 
the defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2019.  Prior to her arrest, 
the Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and 
October of 2019, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March 
of 2020.  At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the 
defendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed. 
Moreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their 
directives and ran away from the arresting agents.  Although the defense has submitted an affidavit 
from the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s 
determination that detention is appropriate here.  The defense already informed the Court at the 
July 14, 2020 bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if 
her security was breached.  (Tr. 55).  Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who 
entered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.

(Def. Ex. S ¶ 12).  Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant 
when they first approached her.  Thus, even if the defendant was following her private security’s 
protocol when she fled, she did so knowing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents, 
not members of the media or general public.  Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly 
in light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of 
her private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement.  Further, the act of 
wrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press.  The 
defense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number 
had been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only 
number of which law enforcement was aware.  In other words, there is still reason to believe, as 
the Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade 
not only the press, but also law enforcement.  (Tr. 87). 
Third, the defendant has access to significant wealth.  At the initial bail hearing, the 
Government expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8 
million she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than 
candid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control.  (Tr. 28-30, 72-73).  The finances 
outlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has 
access to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial 
Services (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a 
person of substantial means with vast resources.5  The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive 
                                                          
5 As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than 
those disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more 
fulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could 
provide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.  (See Tr. 87).

this Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only 
reemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions. 
Now, the defense has submitted a financial report that reflects the defendant has 
approximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial 
Services.  (Def. Ex. O).  Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s 
proposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.  
Not only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,6 but she would 
also have a $2 million townhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself.  In 
other words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would 
still have millions of dollars at her disposal.  She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and 
family to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their 
losses.  In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately 
following her release,7 given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her 
proposed bail package.  
Moreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future 
revenue streams to which the defendant may have access.  The financial report only addresses the 
defendant’s assets without detailing her income at all.  The defendant has similarly provided the 
Court with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective 
                                                          
6 In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in 
unrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other 
items. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the 
retainer paid to her attorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled. 
 
7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents 
of the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond 
amount.  These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as 
a result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.

basis in addition to their substantial assets. The financial repmt submitted by the defense is also 
careful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. 0 at 
5). 
The financial repmt fmther shows that the defendant apparently spent the last five yearn 
moving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through 1:Iusts to her spouse. 
That pattern suggests the defendant has used the process of 1:I'ansfening assets as a means to hide 
her 1:Iue wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant cmrently has 
approximately $3 .4 million worth of assets held in her own name which is close to the amount of 
wealth she told Pre1Ii.al Services she possessed in July 2020. lmpoliantly, though, that number 
omits the millions of dollars of assets that she has 1:I·ansferred from her name through 1:Iust accounts 
to her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire propeliy where the 
defendant was residing when she was anested. 8 This confirms that the Government was right to 
be concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services. 
That practice fmther demons1I·ates the defendant's sophistication in hiding her assets and 
maintaining assets that are under her conu-ol in other names. 
In this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than 
$20 million to her mani.age, but that her husband brought only $200,000.9 (See Def. Ex. 0 at 10). 
8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Preu-ial Services that the property was owned 
by a corporation, and that she was "just able to stay there." (Pre1I·ial Services Repmt at 2). The 
defendant's lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be 1:Iusted to comply with bail 
conditions.

Setting aside whether the defendant's spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the 
financial repo1t the vast majo1ity of the assets contained in the repo1t itself apparently 01iginated 
with the defendant. (See Def. Ex. 0 at 10). Based on the report, it seems cleai· that the defendant 
slowly funneled the maj01ity of her wealth to trnsts and into her husband's name over the last five 
yeai·s. As a result, if the Comt were to grant the defendant's proposed bail package and the 
defendant were to flee, her spouse would p1imaiily lose the money that the defendant gave him 
rather than his own independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee she would 
largely be sacrificing her own money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse 
co-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant's submission does not change the Government's 
position at the original bail heaiing that the defendant has considerable financial resomces, and 
could live a comfortable life as a fugitive. 
The combination of all these factors including the defendant's foreign ties, demonstrated 
ability to live in hiding, and financial resomces, confnm that the defendant's chai·acte1istics 
continue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention 
this is not one of the rai·e cases in which a private secmity company could conceivably be 
considered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). The 
Second Circuit has squai·ely held that "the Bail Refo1m Act does not pe1mit a two-tiered bail 
system in which defendants of lesser means ai·e detained pending trial while wealthy defendants 
ai·e released to self-funded p1ivate jails," and that "a defendant may be released on such a condition 
Comt need not resolve this question, however, because regai·dless of whether the defendant's 
husband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the 
financial rep01t is that the vast majority of the spouse's reported assets upon which the proposed 
bond is based, originated with the defendant meaning he would not be losing his own money if 
the defendant fled. 
25

only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.”  Id.  Here, detention is warranted 
not only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and 
willingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and 
the strength of the evidence, among other factors.  The defense suggestion that the defendant’s 
private security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus.  There 
is no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which 
she has no personal stake losing $1 million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape 
conviction and sentencing.  Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is 
not warranted here.  Id. at 83. 
Relatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers 
little value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to 
prevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed.  At best, home confinement and electronic 
monitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cutting the bracelet.  See United States v. 
Banki, 10 Cr. 008 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2010) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen 
who was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 20 
years’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff’d, 369 F. 
App’x 152 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773 (JG), 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention 
with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); United States v. 
Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099 (JG), 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same).  Simply 
put, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient 
to ensure that this defendant appears in court.

In urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its 
initial briefing and at the July 14, 2020 hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are 
consistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with 
financial means and foreign citizenship.”  (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. 18 at 16, 21; Tr. 48-51).  The Court 
should reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into 
consideration when denying bail.  “A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle 
for relitigating issues already decided by the Court.”  Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 307, 313 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court already considered and rejected 
the defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the 
courts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial 
resources.”  (Tr. 88).  Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases, 
including United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), United States v. Dreier, 
596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of 
reasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.”  (Tr. 88; see id. 
(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources 
available to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being 
found”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail 
package agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought 
detention”)). 
The Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.  
Among the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant 
financial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”

(Tr. 87).  Following the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the 
defendant are readily distinguishable.  See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 
1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other 
things, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that 
he traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government 
committed to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. 03 Cr. 947 (SAS), 
2004 WL 169790, at *1, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2004) (setting conditions of bail where defendant 
arrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the 
Government—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s 
financial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”).  And there is support in the case law for 
detaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff’d, No. 19-344, 2019 WL 2070656 (2d Cir. 
Mar. 7, 2019) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk 
of flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible 
sentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent 
international travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries 
without extradition”); United States v. Patrick Ho, 17 Cr. 779 (KBF), Dkt. 49 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 
2018) (ordering defendant detained based on defendant’s risk of flight and citing the strength of 
the Government’s evidence, lack of meaningful community ties, and “potential ties in foreign 
jurisdictions”); United States v. Epstein, 155 F. Supp. 2d 323, 324-326 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (finding 
that defendant’s dual citizenship in Germany and Brazil, lucrative employment and property 
interests, and lack of an extradition treaty with Brazil weighed in favor of detention despite the 
fact that defendant and his wife owned “substantial” property and other significant assets in the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 31 of 36

United States).  Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged 
here involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing 
further in favor of detention.  See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.  
“Each bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the 
Court.”  Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326.  Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government 
seeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign 
citizenship.  Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign 
countries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,” 
“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with 
a demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons 
discussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense, 
the strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a 
substantial flight risk.  (Tr. 82-91).  The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and 
the defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior 
finding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. 
D. Conditions of Confinement 
Finally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential 
harms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing.  (Tr. 42, 68-
69).  As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release. 
The defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review 
her discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys.  Specifically, the 
defendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.  
Also during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 32 of 36
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page33 of 165

30 
 
counsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant 
has access to legal visits.  Due to the recently implemented lockdown at the MDC, visitation is not 
currently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call 
with legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday.  Defense counsel will 
also be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed.  Given those facts, the defense 
argument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—
a patently incorrect claim.  
The defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the 
Government, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material 
defense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents 
provided by defense counsel.  The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical 
difficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives.  These steps included 
modifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the 
defendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a 
laptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.10  Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to 
review some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her 
discovery.   
                                                          
10 The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the 
laptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer 
thirteen hours per day seven days per week.  The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because 
the MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the 
laptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends.  The MDC 
previously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and 
arranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would 
not have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine.  Now that she is out of 
quarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.

31 
 
As to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that 
the defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the 
ground, and that drive has been replaced.  When the defense informed the Government that the 
drive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have 
IT staff review the drive.  In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable 
and declined to have IT staff review it.  Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that 
the defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC.  At the defense’s request, 
the Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive 
so that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.11  Throughout 
the defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns 
regarding access to discovery and counsel.  The Government will continue to work with MDC 
legal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with 
defense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial. 
As to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the 
defense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.  
Indeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while 
detained is to be away from general population.  Unlike other inmates in protective custody, 
however, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her own 
shower, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her own phone to use, and has her own 
television.  Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention 
                                                          
11 On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery 
produced to date contains little of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and 
the simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have 
temporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which, 
according to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.

other inmates in protective custody.  Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the 
defendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly attuned to any complaints the defendant has raised, 
and following initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has 
ensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from 
which she can supplement her diet.   
The MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the 
institution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.  
In that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit, 
searches of her cell, pat downs when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual 
inspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which 
every other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution.  MDC legal counsel has assured 
the Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls 
and visits with legal counsel.  To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring 
of the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the 
security of the institution and the defendant. 
With respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-19, the Government recognizes, as 
it did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility.  At least for 
this defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked.  When the defendant 
was potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested 
negative, and then was released from quarantine.  As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the 
defendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications 
from COVID-19.  (Tr. 89).  For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that 
the pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.

CONCLUSION 
 
As this Court previously found, the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”  
(Tr. 86).  Nothing in the defense submission justifies altering the Court’s prior conclusion that 
there are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 
 
 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
Annie Farmer submits the following statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed 
motion for bail. 
*** 
I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more 
request that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of 
myself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell.  Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure 
that she stands trial for her crimes.  I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she 
exploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her 
position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would 
fit with her long history of anti-social behavior.  
Drawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has 
lived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children 
and young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has 
demonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and 
demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.  
She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with 
what many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including 
repeatedly lying about me and my family.  Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle 
relying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.  
Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and 
that she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She 
will not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially 
for her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. 
She would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued 
imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last 
several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more

important to her than being connected. Even more concerning, is if she is let out she has the ability 
to once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a lifetime.  
I implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her 
incarcerated until her trial.

Par !'intermediaire d'Andrew .f-'JNKELMA_,_"\J, magistrat de liaison

J'ai l'honneur de vous informer de ce que !'article 696-2 du code de procedure penale frarn;:ais 
prevoit que la France peut extrader << tottte personne n 'qyant pas la nationaliti franraise i>, etant precise que la 
nationalite s'apprecie au jour de la commission des faits pour lesquels !'extradition est demandee 
(article 696-4 1 °). 
Le code de procedure penale franc;:ais proscrit done de maniere absolue !'extradition 
!'extradition d'une personne qui avait la nationalite franc;:aise au moment de la commission des faits 
pour lesquels l' extradition est demandee. 
La loi penale etant d'interpretation stricte, il n'y a pas lieu de discriminer entre les nationaux 
et les binationaux. A partir du moment ou elle etait franc;:aise au moment des faits, la personne reclamee 
est inextradable, peu importe qu'elle soit titulaire d'une ou de plusieurs autres nationalites. 
Lorsque le refus d'extrader est fonde sur la nationalite de la personne reclamee, la France 
applique le principe « aut tradere, aut judicare » selon lequel l'Etat qui refuse la remise doit juger la 
personne. Ainsi, !'article 113-6 du code penal donne competence aux juridictions franc;:aises pour juger 
des faits commis a l'etranger par un auteur de nationalite franc;:aise. 
Certains Etats, en general de droit anglo-saxon, acceptent d'extrader leurs nationaux et n'ont 
en revanche pas competence pour juger les faits commis par leurs ressortissants sur un territoire 
etranger. C'est notamment le cas des Etats-Unis d'Amerique.

L'article 3 du Traite bilateral d'extradition signe le 23 avril 1996 entre les Etats-Unis 
d'Amerique et la France stipule que << l'Etat requis n'est pas tum d'accorder !'extradition de l'un de ses 
ressortissants, mais le Pouvoir exicutif des Etats-Unis a la faculte de le faire, discritionnairement, s'ii le juge 
approprii JJ. 
En application de ce Traite et du principe general de non-extradition des nationaux en droit 
franc;:ais, la France refuse systematiquement d'accorder !'extradition de ressortissants franc;:ais aux 
autorites judiciaires americaines tandis que les autorites americaines acceptent regulierement d'extrader 
leurs ressortissants vets la France. 
Il convient de faire observer que le principe de non-extradition des nationaux vaut non 
seulement a l'egard des Etats-Unis mais egalement de taus les autres Etats a l'exception des Etats-
membres de l'Union europeenne, aux termes de la loi du 9 mars 2004 transposant la decision-cadre 
du 13 juin 2002 sur le mandat d'arret europeen qui prevoit que la remise de la personne reclamee ne 
pourra pas etre refusee au seul motif de sa nationalite franc,:aise. 
Ce temperament au principe de non-extradition des nationaux s'inscrit clans le contexte 
particulier de la construction de l'espace judiciaire europeen qui s'inscrit lui-meme clans un processus 
d'integration politique tres specifique entre les Etats-membres de l'Union europeenne. Ce haut niveau 
d'integration politique existant entre les Etats membres de l'Union europeenne va de pair avec une 
certaine homogeneite, au sein de ces Etats, en matiere d'echelle des peines ainsi qu'en ce qui concerne 
les modalites d'amenagement de peine, les Etats membres etant lies par les memes obligations 
internationales (notamment les obligations decoulant de la convention europeenne de sauvegarde des 
droits de l'homme et des libertes fondamentales et de la jurisprudence de la Cour europeenne des 
droits de l'homme). 
En tout etat de cause, le principe de non-extradition des nationaux est un principe du droit 
de l'extradition auquel la France n'a jamais deroge en dehors du cadre de l'Union europeenne.

Through Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate  
Embassy of the United States of America in Paris 
 
 
 
I have the honor to inform you that Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure 
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality," it being specified that 
nationality is assessed on the day of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested 
(Article 696-4 1°). 
 
 
The French Code of Criminal Procedure therefore absolutely prohibits the extradition of a 
person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is 
requested. 
 
 
The penal law being of strict interpretation, there is no reason to discriminate between 
nationals and binationals. From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person 
claimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities. 
 
When the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France 
applies the principle "aut tradere, aut judicar" according to which the State which refuses the 
surrender must judge the person. Thus, Article 113-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the 
French courts to judge acts committed abroad by a person of French nationality. 
 
Some countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the 
same time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts committed by their nationals on foreign territory. This is 
particularly the case of the United States of America.

Article 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, 1996 between the United 
States of America and France stipulates that “The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition 
of any of its nationals, but the Executive Power of the United States has the right to do so at its 
discretion if it deems it appropriate.”   
 
In application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under 
French law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American 
judicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to 
France. 
 
It should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the 
United States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the 
terms of the Law of March 9, 2004 transposing the framework decision of June 13, 2002 on the 
European arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused 
on the sole ground of his French nationality. 
 
This principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the 
European judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between 
the Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the 
Member States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these 
States in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the 
member states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising 
from the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and 
from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights). 
 
In any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from 
which France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell's appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put 
before the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant 
her release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond in the full 
amount of their net worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has 
proffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are 
U.S. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have 
pledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona tides of 
these proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm, 
which was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, setting forth a statement of her 
financial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not 
challenge the report's findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to 
give up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard 
travel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the 
initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate -
and there is no "significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence" that corroborates its case. 
With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict 
bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute 
for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the 
significant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot 
be eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee 
against all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887,888 n.4, 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 6 of 15
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page50 of 165
892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one ofreasonable 
assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released 
unless there are "no conditions" that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed 
package satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the 
Testimony of Three Witnesses 
In evaluating the strength of the government's case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on 
the government's proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by 
"significant contemporaneous documentary evidence." (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The 
government now expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the 
government's response that it has no "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence"- in 
fact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all- and that its case against Ms. Maxwell 
is based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified, 
concerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no 
specificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged 
incidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling. 
The few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government-which 
are the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing- pertain to Epstein, 
not Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that 
(Gov. Mem. at 11 (emphasis added)). The 
government further states that 
(Id. 
(emphasis added)). The strength of the government's case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue 
2 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 7 of 15
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page51 of 165
here. Whether or not the accusers' recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to 
the strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
The only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal 
value. The government references 
■ (Id. at 11 ). But even the government concedes that, at best, 
It is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly "groomed" the accusers or 
knowingly facilitated or participated in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors will come solely from 
the testimony of the three accusers. The government's case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests 
entirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses. 2 Moreover, the substantive 
counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-I . 
It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense's assertion that it 
did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death 
of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact 
1 The government also proffers that they will have "additional witnesses." (Gov. Mem. at 11). But these are not 
"outcry" witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers. 
Instead, they will testify only that "both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims 
when those victims were minors." (Id.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have "met and interacted with" 
someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing. 
2 One of the witnesses has submitted a letter to the Court. While the CYRA permits the right to be heard, the letter 
should be given no legal weight in the Court's bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 331-
32 (E.D.N.Y. 2005)

as a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein. 3 The government's case is not what it represented 
to the Comt at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail. 4 
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden 
A. 
The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell's Substantial 
Ties to the United States, Including Her Spouse 
The government inconectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new 
infonnation and that the Court was "akeady awaTe of' the defendant's friends and family in 
the United States. (Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail 
heaTing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come fo1ward as a co-signor and has submitted a 
detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over fom years 
and the important role she has played, and continues to play 
-
It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of 
whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come fo1ward, at considerable personal risk, 
to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of suppoli. This information which 
was not available to the Comt at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's 
strong ties to this countiy and weighs heavily in favor of bail. 
Rather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance 
of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial 
Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step 
fmwaI"d as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (Id. at 13-14). The government is entirely 
3 Moreover, the government failure to request---- regardless of whether it was legally obligated to 
do so, shows that the government has accepte~mts without serious scrutiny. Given the 
government's ongoing Brady obligations, it is unsettling that the government would simply accept 
4 Contrary to the government's assertion, the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment. 
(Gov. Mem. at 10 n.l). We believe we have strong arguments that have only gotten stronger with the production of 
discovery. We will be making those arguments to the Com1 in our pretrial motions to be filed next month.

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page53 of 165
mistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting 
a divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to 
protect him 
from the terrible consequences of being associated with her. 
Nevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing, 
She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue 
discussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any 
reason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the 
government has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's 
relationship with her spouse 
is not a powerful tie to this country. 
The government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship 
with 
is particularly callous 
and belied by the facts. (Gov. Mem. at 14). As her spouse explains, 
(Ex. A ,-r 12). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of 
Her and Her Spouse's Assets in Support of Her Bond 
The government's attempts to rebut the financial condition report are unavailing. 
Significantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the 
voluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that 
calls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for 
the last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail. 
Rather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms. 
Maxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23). 
5

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page54 of 165
The report shows nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was sitting in a jail cell at the time, 
was asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best 
estimate of the assets she held in her own name, which the government concedes she did 
with remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements. 5 
The government's arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will 
view at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the 
government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated "sophistication in hiding her assets" 
and characterizes her transfers to a trust as "funneling" assets to her spouse to "hide her true 
wealth." (Id. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly 
sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully 
disclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets 
disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are 
included in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees. 
The government further argues that the fmancial condition report shows that Ms. 
Maxwell has access to millions of dollars of "unrestrained funds" that she could use to flee 
the country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (Id. at 23). That 
characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell 
has procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property. 
Second, the $4 million controlled by her spouse 
could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty. 
The government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future 
contingent assets and income that may never materialize. (Id. at 23-24). For example, ■ 
5 Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview. 
6 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 11 of 15
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page55 of 165
Similarly, the financial report does not include 
a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical 
and current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse 
-
and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the 
reference to 
is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of-
But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package 
with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of 
their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell's wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It 
is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial 
consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The 
proposed bail package does exactly that. 6 
C. 
The Government's Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is "Adept" at Hiding and 
Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious 
The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had "an 
expertise at remaining hidden," and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive. 
6 The government's argument that her spouse's moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the 
majority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (Id. at 24-25). Regardless of whose m~gin with, 
all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her spouse- - will be 
left with nothing. Furthennore, the government's assertion that they could not verify the spouse's financial 
infonnation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (Id. at 24 n.9). The 
defense provided the spouse's current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank. 
7 

 
 
8 
(Gov. Mem. at 20).  The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing 
a pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding 
and somehow forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee.  (Id.).  These arguments are just further 
evidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible 
light.  As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne 
out of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.  
Moreover, they are not predictive of flight.  There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the 
measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would 
then willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice.  To the contrary, she 
remained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case. 
D. 
Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly 
Unlikely 
The government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as 
to France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee 
with absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver.  (Gov. Mem. at 14).  The 
government misses the point:  Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate 
her ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment 
to remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K. 
experts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver 
as part of any extradition request. 
 
In an attempt to counter William Julié’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that 
the French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the 
government attaches a letter from the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) that references neither 
Mr. Julié’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.  (Gov. Mem., Ex. B).  But

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page57 of 165
as Mr. Julie's accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the 
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an 
international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1 ). This rule is necessitated by the French 
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (Id.). 
Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition 
treaty between the United States and France provides for it-which it does. (Id. at 3). 
The government's reliance on a 2006 case-in which France refused to extradite a 
French national who was also a U.S. citizen- provides no precedent as to how a French court 
would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the 
United States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (Id. at 2-3). Nor does it 
undermine Mr. Julie's opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries 
has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a 
U.S. court, it is "highly unlikely" that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id. at 3). 
The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell's U.K. extradition 
expert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry's opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be "highly 
unlikely" to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be 
admissible in any extradition proceeding, and that--contrary to the government's representation 
at the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)- bail would be "extremely unlikely." (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at 
, 39). Mr. Perry's addendum opinion (attached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the 
waiver would be "a highly relevant factor" in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of 
extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. , 3). 7 
7 Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general "discretion to deny extradition" after a 
court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of 
exceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell's case. (Id. ,i,i 4-5). 
9

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page58 of 165
Finally, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country 
other than the United Kingdom and France holds her- and any defendant- to an impossible 
standard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). By the 
government's reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail, 
because there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they 
had no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be 
enforced. However, "Section 3142 does not seek ironclad guarantees." United States v. Chen, 
820 F. Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D. Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell's ties to France and 
the United Kingdom- where she has not lived for nearly 30 years- create a flight risk, her 
extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it. 8 
E. 
The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail 
The government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell, 
though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become 
infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell's mouth, 
which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive 
cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that "[i]t 
has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue." As the Court is well 
aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be 
discontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed. 
8 Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France 
of Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,

WILLIAM JULIE 
AVOCAT A LACOUR 
Response to the government's memorandum in opposition to the defendant's renewed 
motion for release. 
I was asked to review the United States government's memorandum and notably pages 15 to 
17 alongside the French Minister of Justice's letter dated 11 December 2020 produced as 
Exhibit B to this memorandum. 
1 
The French Minister of Justice's letter (Exhibit B) 
The letter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that 
the French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to 
the United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which 
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality". 
It remains unclear whether the author of such letter had actually access to my opinion which is 
not even quoted, and more generally it seems the letter responds to a question which 
unexpectedly was not disclosed. 
The letter fails to mention, however, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions 
of the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence 
of an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure: "In the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the 
conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this 
chapter1. These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by 
international conventions"). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international 
agreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: "Treaties 
or agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an 
authority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by 
the other party"). It follows from these provisions that the key question is whether France may 
extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or 
under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France 
extradites its citizens under French legislation. 
In accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of 11 March 2004, 
published by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying how the then recently 
amended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the 
following: "Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of 
1 The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-1 to Article 696-47-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, 
and thus includes Article 696-2.

subsidiarity of domestic law in relation to international instruments as stated by the 
aforementioned law of 10 March 1927: the legislative provisions on extradition are applicable 
only in the silence or in the absence of international conventions."2 
It follows from the provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure that the 
key question is whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty 
between the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union 
and the USA, not whether France may extradite its citizens under French legislation. 
As previously outlined, the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not preclude 
the French government from extraditing a French national and must therefore be distinguished 
from a number of other international agreements signed by France which contain a clear 
prohibition to that extent. The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French 
government discretion as to whether or not to extradite its own citizens to the USA. 
It is noted that the letter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue. 
2 
The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case 
In support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine 
Maxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French 
American citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2007. 
The Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, I am not aware that this 
case has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the 
support of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has 
referred to in its memorandum, I doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case: 
as mentioned by the 2007 letter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the 
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision 
refusing extradition on August 22nd 2007, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the 
beginning of August 2007). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision 
from the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could 
have been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed 
on to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process. 
A refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the 
French Conseil d 'Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative matters, as for 
example the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the 
French authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested ( Conseil 
d 'Etat, 15 October1993, no. 142578). In the Peterson case, the American government did not

challenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial 
review of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure. 
Secondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the 
outcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts. 
Third, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their 
aforementioned letter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in 
its memorandum: 
"Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in 
pertinent part that "There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the 
extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State". While this Article 
does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not 
appear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such 
extradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in 
Javor of extradition ". 
I am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I 
came to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule 
against the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary power is not a legal rule. 
Indeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these 
reasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of 
this case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an 
extradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable 
waiver in the USA. 
Finally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations 
of the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would 
also need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and 
the United States of America, which came into force on February 1st, 2010, several years after 
the Peterson case. Article 1 of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between 
Contracting Parties, provides that: "The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of 
applicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America 
governing extradition of offenders". The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken 
into account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to 
grant the extradition of a French national to the USA.

IN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION 
ON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
RE GIDSLAINE MAXWELL 
ADDENDUM OPINION 
1. 
This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government's Memorandum 
in Opposition to the Defendant's Renewed Motion to Release dated 16 December 
2020, insofar as it pertains to matters of English extradition law and practice. 
2. 
The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2020 ('the Opinion') 
remain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and 
Wales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it 
is virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances 
where the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United 
States prior to trial and in breach of bail; and ( c) on the basis of the information 
currently known, it is highly unlikely ' that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the 
superseding indictment dated 7 July 2020. In addition to those conclusions, the 
following three points may be made. 
3. 
First, as noted in the Opinion2, Ms Maxwell's waiver of extradition would be 
admissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a 
document cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in 
the United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any 
contested extradition proceedings. In particular: 
(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United 
States and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that 
1 The Government observes, at p.16 of the Motion, that this leaves open a "possibility " that extradition could be 
resisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is 
that, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently known, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances 
in which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone 
conclusion. 
2 Opinion, para. 39. 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103-2   Filed 12/23/20   Page 3 of 4
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page66 of 165
document to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be 
refused for the duration of the extradition proceedings. 
(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell3 require 
the extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be 
oppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars 
unavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to 
conceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made 
in relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances 
where she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her 
extradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her 
bail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in 
assessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under 
Article 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights 
bars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in 
the Opinion 4 . 
(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly 
likely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to 
treat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism. 
4. 
Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2003 ('the 2003 Act') 
confers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is 
sent to her by the extradition judge5. The ambit of the power in section 93 is 
described at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse 
extradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable 
bar to extradition6 is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the 
request has been withdrawn 7; ( c) there is a competing claim for extradition from 
3 Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition. 
4 Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37. 
5 As appears to be submitted by the Government at p.19 of the Memorandum. 
6 The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality 
(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the 
United Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A). 
7 Extradition Act 2003, s. 93(4)(a). 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103-2   Filed 12/23/20   Page 4 of 4
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page67 of 165
another state8; (d) the person has been granted asylum or humanitarian protection in 
the United Kingdom9; or (e) extradition would be against the interests of UK 
national security 10. On the information currently known, none of these bars or 
exceptions would arise in the case of Ms Maxwell. 
5. 
The exceptional nature of the Secretary of State's power is illustrated by the fact that 
it has been exercised in the favour of a requested person on only one occasion since 
the enactment of the 2003 Act, and that that single exercise of the power was based 
on grounds on which reliance may not now be placed. 11 
6. 
Third, as to the timescales of extradition proceedings arising from requests for 
extradition made by the Government of the United States, it is to be noted that the 
purpose of the 2003 Act to streamline extradition procedures 12 and, in practice, the 
legislation works to facilitate extradition. As noted in the Opinion 
13 the majority of 
extradition cases conclude within two years, or three months in cases where consent 
to extradition is given.

UNITED STA TES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
V 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
OPINION AND ORDER 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; t:ra11sporting 
minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 a11d 2; a11d two charges 
ofpe1jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Cou1t held a lengthy bail heaiing on July 14, 
2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the heaiing, the Comt concluded that the 
Defendant was a cleai· 1isk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would 
ensure her appea1·a11ce. Bail was therefore denied. 
TI1e Defendant has now filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending tlial, which 
the Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the 
reasons that the Cow·t provided in denying bail a11d proposes a substa11tially lai·ger bail package. 
But by and lai·ge, the ai·guments presented either were made at the initial bail heai·ing or could 
have been made then. In any event, the new infonnation provided in the renewed application 
only solidifies the CoU1t's view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no 
1

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 2 of 22 
combination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which 
cany a presumption of detention, are serious and cany lengthy te1ms of imp1isonment if 
convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple c01rnborating and 
c01rnborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties 
(including citizenship in a countly that does not exti·adite its citizens); and the Defendant, who 
lived in hiding and apait from the family to whom she now asse1ts important ties, has not been 
fully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court 
denied the Defendai1t's first motion for release on July 14, 2020, the Court DENIES the 
Defendant's renewed motion for release on bail. 1 
I. 
Background 
On June 29, 2020, a grandjmy in the Southern Distiict of New York returned a six-count 
Indictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of 
multiple minor victims between approximately 1994 ai1d 1997. See Dkt. No. 1. On July 2, 2020, 
the Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was aiTested in New Hampshire. 
On July 8, 2020, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small 
ministe1ial co1Tections. Dkt. No. 17. 
On July 14, 2020, this Comt held a heaii.ng regarding the Defendant's request for bail. 
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant's arguments and of the factors set fo1th in 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Comt concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant's appearai1ce, dete1mining as a result that the Defendai1t was a 
flight risk ai1d that detention without bail was wa1Tai1ted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). The 
1 TI1is Opinion & Order will be temporaiily sealed in order to allow the paities to propose 
redactions to sensitive or confidential information.

Defendant did not appeal the Comt's determination that detention was required, and she has been 
incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
II. 
Legal Standard 
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution, which prohibits the imposition of "le Jxcessive bail," and under the Bail Reform 
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq. TI1e Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant 
"subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that litJ 
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the 
factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Comt concludes that "no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of 
any other person and the community," may the Court order that the defendant be held without 
bail. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). 
If there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense specifically 
enumerated in § 3142( e)(3 ), a rebuttable presumption arises "that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure" the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or 
others. 18 U.S.C. § 3142( e)(3). In such circumstances, ''the defendant 'bears a limited burden of 
production ... to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose 
a danger to the community or a risk of flight."' United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d 
Cir. 201 1) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001)); see also 
United States v. Rodrigue-:., 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) (' lAJ defendant must introduce some 
evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption."). Nonetheless, '"the 
government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the 
3 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page72 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 4 of 22 
defendant presents a danger to the community,' and 'by the lesser standard of a preponderance of 
the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight."' English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting 
Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 (2d Cir. 1986) 
("The government retains the burden of persuasion l in a presumption case J ."). Even when "a 
defendant has met his burden of production," however, "the presumption favoring detention does 
not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district 
corut." United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290 91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
After a comt has made an initial detennination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Corut may reopen the bail 
hearing if "i.nfonnation exists that was not known to the movant at the ti.me of the hearing and 
that has a material bearing on the issue" of whether pretrial detention is waiTanted. 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(f). But the Comt is not required to reopen the heai·ing or to conduct a11other heaii.ng if it 
determines that a11y new info1mation would not have a material beaii.ng on the issue. See United 
States v. Raniere, No. 18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 
5, 2018) (noting that ' laJs the court has already held one detention heaii.ng, it need not hold 
a11other" the sta11dai·ds set fo1th in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2) ai·e met); United States v. Havens, 487 
F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the 
new i.nfonnation would not have changed the comt's decision to detain the defendant until hi.al). 
m. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f) a11d the 
Comt's inherent powers to review its own bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already 
noted,§ 3142(f) provides that a bail heaii.ng "may be reopened ... at any ti.me before ti·ial if the 
judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the ti.me of the 
4 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page73 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 5 of 22 
hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that 
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other 
person and the community." A corut may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even where the circumstances do not match§ 3142(f)'s statut01y text. See, e.g., 
United States v. Rowe, 
o. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 21 , 
2003) (noting that "a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing."); United States v. 
Petrov, 
o. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
'Comt's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Corut's previous bail decision"). 
In line with this, the Defendant's new motion aims to address the reasons that the Comt 
provided when it originally detennined that no conditions could reasonably assure her 
appearance and that pretrial detention was wairnnted. First, the Defenda11t proposes a more 
expa11sive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses a11y concerns regai·ding 1isk of flight. 
The newly proposed conditions include a 28.5 million bail package, which consists of a 22.5 
million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defenda11t and her spouse and secured by 
approximately 8 million in prope1ty a11d 500,000 in cash, along with six additional bonds-
five co-signed by the Defendant's friends a11d family members and the sixth posted by the 
secmity company that would provide secmity services to the Defendant if she were granted bail 
and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide 
that the Defendant would be released to the custody of a fainily member, who would serve as her 
third-paity custodia11 under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home 
confinement with GPS monito1ing and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and 
Eastern Distlicts of New York and would be limited to appeai·ances in Comt, meetings with 
5

counsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Comt or Pretrial Services. Id at 2 3. 
Fmthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who 
would prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Comt or 
Pretrial Services and who would esco1t her when she is authorized to leave. Id. at 3. 
The motion also presents new infmmation that, according to the Defendant, addresses the 
concerns that the Comt aiticulated when it detennined that detention was waiTanted. This newly 
presented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail 
heaii.ng, includes evidence of the Defendai1t's fainily ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at 
10 14; a detailed financial repo1t that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the 
Defendant's financial conditions and assets, see id at 15-18; evidence that according to her 
rebuts the Government's 01i.ginal contention that she attempted to evade law enforcement p1i.or 
to her atTest, see id at 18-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United 
Kingdom ai1d Frai1ce, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendai1t would not be able 
to resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id at 25-29; and evidence that she 
argues lays bai·e the weakness of the Government's case against her, see id. at 30---34. 
Finally, the Defendai1t argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result 
of the COVID-19 pai1demic, present ai1 additional factor fav01i.ng release. She claims that the 
conditions imposed ai·e punitive and that tl10se conditions interfere with her ability to paiticipate 
in her defense, and she asserts that these factors fu1ther militate in favor of release. See id at 34 
38. 
Having cai·efully considered all of the Defendai1t's ai·gmnents, the Comt again concludes 
tl1at no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that 
6 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page75 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 7 of 22 
detention without bail is wairnnted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). l11e Corut accordingly denies 
Defendant's request to reopen the original bail heaiing and denies her renewed motion for bail. 
A. The presumption in favor of detention applies 
l11e Comt is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of 
pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. Tue Bail Reform Act 
provides that if a defendant is chai·ged with committing an offense involving a minor victim 
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, "it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assme the appea1·a11ce of the person as required a11d the safety of the 
community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person 
committed." 18 U.S.C. § 3142( e)(3)(E). Tue Defendant's indictment by a grand jmy suffices to 
establish that there is probable cause to believe that she committed the offenses chai·ged in the 
indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 51, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that 
that a11 indictment returned by a properly constituted gra11d jmy "conclusively dete1mines the 
existence of probable cause" and that ''the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a 
prelirninary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursua11t 
to Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedme." (citations omitted)). In light of the 
crimes charged in the indictment, the Comt begins with the presumption that no condition or 
combination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appeai·ance. 
When the presumption applies, the Defendant beai·s a limited burden of production 
''tending to coru1ter the § 3142(e) presumption of flight," Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The 
Defenda11t's bmden of production only requires that she' introduce a ce1tain a1noru1t of evidence 
contrai·y to the presumed fact." United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 380 (1st Cir. 1985), 
7 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page76 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 8 of 22 
abrogated on other grounds by United States v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810 (1st Cir. 1990). l11at 
burden is "limited." United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433,436 (2d Cir. 2001). The 
Defendant's proffer of evidence and info1mation 
including info1mation relating to her financial 
conditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things-satisfies this limited 
burden. As the Comt discussed at the July 14, 2020 hearing, these factors bear on the question 
of whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed 
motion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight 1isk. In that sense, 
this evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively low threshold 
imposed by the burden of production. 
l11e presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, however, and it "remains a factor 
to be considered among those weighed by the district coUit." United States v. Mercedes, 254 
F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144). As a result,' laJ judicial officer 
conducting a detention heating should, even after a defendai1t has come fo1wai·d with rebuttal 
evidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that 
Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ' a strong probability 
aiises' that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appeai·a11ce." Martir, 
782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted). 
B. The new information does not alter the Court's initial determination 
When dete1mining whether there ai·e conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
appeai·a11ce of the person as required, courts ai·e required to consider the factors outlined in 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Thus, the Court considers (1) the nature ai1d circumstai1ces of the offense 
charged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence, 
(3) the defendant's hist01y and chai·acteristics, and (4) the natme and se1iousness of the danger to 
8 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page77 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 9 of 22 
any person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also 
18 u.s.c. § 3142(g). 
At the July 14, 2020 bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding 
that no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required. 
And the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged 
with offenses involving mi.nor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of 
the offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On 
the other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a 
danger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The 
Defendant's arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors. 
As explained below, neither the arguments put fo1th in the Defendant's renewed motion 
for bail nor the evidence she submitted in conjunction with her motion rebut the CoUit's 
conclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no 
conditions ofrelease will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance at future proceedings. 
1. The Weight of the Evidence 
The Comt will address the strength of the Government's case first. The Defendant 
argues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary co1rnboration of the witness 
testimony and that the discove1y produced to date has included only a "small number of 
documents from the ti.me period of the conspiracy." Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result, 
that the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July 14, 2020 bail 
hearing. See id at 30 33. So she ar·gues that the second § 3142(g) factor supports release. 
TI1e Comt disagrees. Arguing that the case against her "is based almost exclusively on 
the recollections of the tlu·ee accusers, who remain unidentified," tl1e Defendant contends tl1at tl1e 
9 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page78 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 10 of 22 
weight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness 
testimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that 
the three witnesses will provide detailed and c01Toborating accounts of the Defendant's alleged 
role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov't Opp'n at 10; see also Dkt. No. 17, Sl 
Superseding Indictment, 
7, 11, 13, 17. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional 
evidence, including flight records and other witnesses' corroborating testimony, will fu1ther 
suppo1t the main witnesses' testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein's conduct. Gov't 
Opp'n at 10--11. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on 
Epstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking 
the Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government's charges against 
her. As the CoUit stated in the July 14, 2020 hearing, although the CoUit does not prejudge the 
merits of the Government's case or of the Defendant's defenses, for pmposes of the bail 
determination stage, the Government's proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See 
Dkt. No. 93 ("Tr.") at 83:4- 83:10. The Comt again concludes that the Defendant's awareness of 
the potential strength of the government's case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the 
Defendant's new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor 
suppmts detention. 
2. The Defendant's History and Characteristics 
At the July 14, 2020 bail hearing, the Comt dete1mined that the Defendant was a flight 
risk in part because of her substar1tial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships 
ar1d familial ar1d personal connections abroad ar1d her ownership of at least one foreign prope1ty 
of significant value. See Tr. at 83: 13- 83:18. And the Comt further noted that the Defendant's 
extraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page79 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 11 of 22 
COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Id. at 83:21 83:25. l11e Cmut also observed that the 
Defendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the 
absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also 
suppo1ted the conclusion that flight would not pose an insmmountable burden for her. Id. at 
84:4 84:9. While the Defendant's renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it 
does not alter the Court's conclusion. 
l11e first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to 
have substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have 
familial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the 
present motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the CoUit's concern that the 
Defendant's French citizenship presented the opportllility that she could flee to France and that 
she would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:18-83:20, the Defendant now 
offers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with 
expert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an 
extradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the 
Government points out in its brief, however, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested. 
The French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a letter submitted in conjunction to the 
Government's opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the 
extradition of a French national. See Gov't Opp'n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant's own 
expert attempts to rebut the Ministry ofJustice's letter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the 
Defendant's own expe1ts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the 
possibility that extr·adition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 ("On the basis of 
the infonnation cmTently known, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
11 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page80 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 12 of 22 
successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding 
indictment dated 7 July 2020."); Def. Mot., Ex. V, 76 ("It would .. . become a matter for the 
French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against Ms. 
Ghislaine Maxwell."); id 
77 ("llJt is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse 
to issue and execute an extradition decree against Ms Maxwell. ... "). Nor has the Defendant 
presented any cases where comts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of 
extradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition, 
the reasoning in those cases tmned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the 
enforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-1514, 1999 WL 
1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999); United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 
(N.D.N.Y. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132 33 (D.D.C. 2004); United 
States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992). In those cases, the courts included 
such waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express 
dete1mination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly 
opined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g. , United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d 
306, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing the "Defense proposal to give advance consent to 
extradition and waiver of extradition rights" as' an empty gesture."); United States v. Morrison, 
No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016) ("Although the defendants 
have signed a waiver of extradition, such a waiver may not become valid until an extradition 
request is pending in Canada and may be subject to withdrawal."); United States v. Stroh, No. 
396-CR-139 (AHN), 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. C01m. Nov. 3, 2000) (' llJt appears that there 
is a substantial legal question as to whether any country to which he fled would enforce any 
waiver of extradition signed under the circumstances presented in this case. At any event, 
12

extradition from Israel (or any other countly) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process 
and, at worst, impossible."). 
Having carefully reviewed the expe1ts' repmts and the cases cited by the Defendant,2 the 
Comt's analysis of the relationship between the Defendant's French citizenship and the risk of 
flight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in pa1t by the substantial legal 
questions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory exti·adition waivers and the likelihood that 
any exti·adition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood 
that the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to 
resolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any 
extradition requests---even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop exti·adition 
entirely weighs strongly in favor of detention. 
In addition, the Defendant's extraordina1y financial resources also continue to provide 
her the means to flee the countly and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not 
by itself justify continued detention. But as the Comt noted at the initial bail hearing, the 
Defendant's financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and 
foreign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the 
press, or othe1wise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23 
(distinguishing tl1is case from United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), 
2 The Defendant also argues that ' a defendant's waiver of the right to appeal an exti·adition order 
has been recognized as an indication of the defendant's intent not to flee." Def. Mot. at 27 
(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). The Comt places 
little weight on this argument. Under the Defendant's theo1y, a defendant could sti·ategically 
offer to waive the right to exti·adition while intending to resist any subsequent exti·adition that 
might result. TI1e Comt is unpersuaded. 
13 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page82 of 165

United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and United States v. Madoff, 586 
F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)). 
The Comt's concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or 
employment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the 
evidence submitted in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has 
submitted a litany of letters of suppo1t written by friends and family members. See Def. Mot., 
Exs. A N, W X. These letters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has 
significant ties to the United States and attest to the Defendant's character. The Defendant 
places particular emphasis on the letter written by her spouse, whose identity and connection to 
the Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at 11- 13. 
In that letter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her anest, noting in pa1ticular that 
the Government's characterization of the Defendant's "transient" lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was 
belied by the ' quiet family life" that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at 11 ; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A 
4-5. Other letters similarly highlight that the Defendant's family and affective ties in the 
United States are stronger than was 01iginally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing. 
These letters substantiate the Defendant's claim that she has impo1tant ties to people in 
the United States, but they leave unaltered the Court's conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insunnountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant now argues that 
her newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the countly, but 
at the time she was a1rnsted, she was not living with him and claimed to be getting divorced. See 
Pretrial Services Rep01t at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be 
released on bail, undercutting her argument that that relationship would create an insmmountable 
burden to her fleeing. Fruthennore, the fact that she has :fiiends and family in the United States 
14 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page83 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 15 of 22 
does not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country. 
In addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States--another 
factor weighing in favor of detention. Fmthennore, it is apparent from the letters that the 
Defendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the 
renewed motion for bail alters the Court's fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insmmountable burden to the Defendant. 
Other factors that similarly speak to the Defendant's hist01y and characteristics weigh in 
favor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant's pattern of providing incomplete or e1Toneous 
information to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court's application of 
the third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2020 the Defendant represented 
to Pretrial Services that she possessed around 3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her 
spouse's assets and assets that had been transferred to t:rnst accounts) and the representation that 
the New Hampshire prope1ty was owned by a corporation and that she was ' just able to stay 
there." See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant now claims that she "was detained at 
the time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these 
numbers from mem01y. According to the Macalvins repo1t, l the financial figures J are a close 
approximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her own name at the time of 
her arrest. ... For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her lspouseJ and expressed that to Pretrial Services." Def. Mot. at 16 n.5. Even if the 
Defendant was unable to provide an exact number, however, the difference between the number 
she originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number now presented to the Court in the 
Macalvins repo1t, a report on the Defendant's finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm 
for purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. 0 , makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation 
15 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page84 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 16 of 22 
was the result of the Defendant's misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the 
Defendant's concerns regarding her spouse's p1ivacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish 
any explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services 
and, by extension, the Comt. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, str·onger 
now than in July 2020, as it is clear to the Comt that the Defendant's representations to Pretrial 
Services were woefully incomplete. TI1at lack of candor raises significant concerns as to 
whether the Court has now been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the 
Defendant's willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release. 
For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh 
in favor of detention. 
C. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
In light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of 
persuasion by ' a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a 1isk of flight." 
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3142(g) factors into 
account, the Cou1t concludes that the preswnption in favor of detention, the natw·e and 
characteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and 
characteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the 
Government has also shown, and the Comt concludes for the reasons outlined below, that the 
Defendant's proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Tims, the Comt's 
original conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight 1isk and that no set of conditions can 
reasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered. 
As already noted, the Defendant now proposes a 28.5 million bail package, which 
includes a 22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse 
16 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page85 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 17 of 22 
and secured by approximately 8 million in prope1ty and . 500,000 in cash, along with six 
additional bonds-five co-signed by the Defendant's friends and family members and the sixth 
posted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were 
granted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the 
Court noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant's fmances rendered it difficult to set fmancial 
bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in comt. l11e fmancial info1mation 
that the Defendant presented to the Comt at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete, 
and as the Comt noted, the Comt lacked "a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and the 
resources available to her." Tr. at 86 87. 
l11e Defendant has now presented to the Comt what is perhaps a more thorough repo1t on 
her fmances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins 
analyzed the Defendant's assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on, 
among other things, bank statements, tax retmns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of 
the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the 
benefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2015 to 2020. See Def. Mot., Ex. 0. 
In addition, the Defendant retained a Ce1tified Fraud Examiner and a fo1mer IRS Special 
Agent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and dete1mined that 
report accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex. 
P. l11e Defendant's new bail proposal is based on the nmnbers derived from the Macalvins 
report. 
But even assmning that the financial rep01t provides an accurate analysis of the 
Defendant's finances, the Comt is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably 
assures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave mu-estrained 
17 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page86 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 18 of 22 
millions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov't 
Opp'n at 23. Fmthermore, the proposed bond is only paitially secured. Taking into account the 
vast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing 
alone, ca1mot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Comt's 
conclusion altered by the fact that a number of third paities have pledged to support her bond; 
the amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and 
future income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her 
to compensate them, in pait or in full, for their losses. And while the Defenda11t argues that she 
has procured "significa11t loa11s on the basis of a negative pledge" over a prope1ty a11d that 4 
million is invested in an "illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable 
difficulty," see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Comt's ultimate conclusion 
that the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight. 
TI1e proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the 
custody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant's third-paity custodian under 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B)(i); that the Defendant would be placed in home confmement with GPS 
monitoring a11d that her travel would be restricted to the Southern a11d Eastern Districts of ew 
York and would be limited to appeai·ances in CoU1t, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and 
upon approval by the Comt or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of 
Pretrial Services; a11d that she would surrender all travel documents. Id. at 2-3. Fmthermore, 
the Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the 
residence at a11y time without prior approval by the Comt or Pretrial Services and who would 
escort her when she is authorized to leave. Id. at 3. 
18 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page87 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 19 of 22 
None of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. Here, 
too, the Comt's original dete1mination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the 
original hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinaiy capacity to evade detection, 
"le Jven in the face of what the Defense has acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to 
locate her." Tr. at 87:4 87:19. Indeed, regai·dless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the 
press, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her aiTest, her sophistication in 
evading detection reveals the futility ofrelying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring, 
restrictive home confinement, and private security guai·ds, to secure her appeai·a11ce. See Tr. at 
87:4 88:2. As other comts have observed, "home detention with electronic monitoring does not 
prevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant's head stait." United States v. Zarger, No. 00-
CR-773-S-l (JG), 2000 WL 1134364, at* 1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000). Furthermore, while the 
Defendant now represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who 
would serve as the Defendai1t's third-paity custodiai1 under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B)(i), ai1d 
that she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not 
outweigh the other significai1t factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the 
Defendai1t's argument that private security guai·ds could ensure her appeai·a11ce at future 
proceedings mns afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held "does not 
pe1mit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means ai·e detained pending trial 
while wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails." United States v. Boustani, 
932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be 
detained regai·dless of her wealth, ai1d "if a similai·ly situated defendai1t of lesser meai1s would be 
detained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for 
private detention." Id 
19 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page88 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 20 of 22 
In light of the above, the Comt again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the 
Defendant's proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assme her appearance. TI1e 
presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the histo1y and characteristics 
of the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant's new arguments change the 
Comt's original dete1mination. 
D. The Defendant's conditions of confinement do not justify release 
Lastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant's argument that the conditions of her 
confinement are uniquely onerous, inte1fere with her ability to pa1ticipate in her defense, and 
thus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35- 38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully 
dispute that she has received "more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her 
discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys." Gov't Opp'n at 
29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by 
BOP, including a recent lockdown due to COVID-19 that curtailed in-person legal visitations, 
the Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her 
constitutional right to paiticipate in her defense. And while the Comt acknowledges the 
Defendant's concerns regarding the conditions of her confmement, the Defendant has failed to 
provide any basis to conclude that release is waiTanted on those grounds-even after the Comt 
has determined that she continues to pose a flight risk. 3 
3 TI1e Comt will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regulai·ly 
with her attorneys ai1d to review all necessaiy discove1y materials to prepai·e for her defense. 
Defense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they 
are not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the CoU1t. 
20 

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page89 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 21 of 22 
Finally, as the Cmut expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the 
spread of COVID-19 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the 
incidence ofCOVID-19 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is tmly 
ala1ming. See COVID-19: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/ 
coronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2020) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and 11 
staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19). It could be argued that in the face of 
this, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending 
trial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not 
hesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government 
rests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Comt 
found at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at 
heightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. l11e pandemic, including 
increasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Comt 
finds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of 
conditions could reasonably assure her appearance. 
E. A hearing is unnecessary 
Having carefully reviewed the pa1ties' arguments, the Comt dete1mines that a hearing is 
unnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. l11e briefing from both sides 
comprehensively lays out the parties' respective ar·guments For the reasons stated above, none 
of the new inf01mation has a material bearing on the CoU1t's determination that the Defendar1t 
poses a flight 1isk. Indeed, mar1y of the reasons that the Court provided at the July 14, 2020 
hearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Comt need not hold another

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third 
Motion for Release on Bail. 
As Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no 
intention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States 
for 30 years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country. 
She wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court 
deems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the 
25-year-old charges in the Indictment.  Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to 
our knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her 
appearance. (See Dkt. 97.)  In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms. 
Maxwell now proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily 
restrictive bail package she has already offered. 
• First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate 
any opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires. 
 
• Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds 
earmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to 
defend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and 
for taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal 
District Court judge and former United States Attorney who will function as asset 
monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.  
 
The former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed 
insufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to 
seek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom.  (See id. at 11-13).  As a non-citizen, Ms. 
Maxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 2 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page93 of 165

citizens of those countries.  The latter condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they 
cannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court.  This should 
satisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets 
unrestrained that could be used for such purposes.  (See id. at 17-18). 
 
In addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submitted twelve pretrial 
motions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or 
all of the charges against her.  Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail 
application (see Dkt. 18 at 19) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the 
chance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of 
January 25.  These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case 
against Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention. 
Ms. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion.  She 
has been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has 
poisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury.  She has been relentlessly 
attacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have 
neither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an attempt 
to turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein.  Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined – 
and welcomes the opportunity – to face her accusers at trial and clear her name.  The additional 
proposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee.  The Court should 
therefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare 
for trial.

I. 
The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s 
Appearance in Court 
 
As set forth above, Ms. Maxwell now proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate 
any means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country.  The Court should therefore 
reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions.  See United States v. 
Rowe, No. 02 CR. 756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) (“[A] release 
order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to 
the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. 15-CR-66-
LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for 
reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”). 
A. 
Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship 
To demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide 
further assurance to the Court that she will not attempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is 
willing to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom.  Should 
the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submitted to the 
appropriate authorities.   Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s 
passports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made. 
If the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally 
commence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the 
process of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately 
upon granting of bail.  The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate, 
may be expedited. 
 
Citizenship is a precious and priceless asset.  Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up 
citizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 4 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page95 of 165

5 
 
earnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to 
flee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense. 
Her renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of 
waivers of extradition.  (See Dkt. 106 at 13).  Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest 
extradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any 
incentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries. 
B. 
Restraint and Monitoring of Assets 
 
 
In denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms. 
Maxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could 
be used to facilitate her flight from the country.  (See id. at 17-18).  To assuage any concerns that 
those assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell 
has taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are 
not used to secure the bond, while still allowing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for 
her spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes. 
1.   
New Account 
All assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in 
escrow for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in 
the name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)1, will be deposited in a newly 
created account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to 
order of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s 
remaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale 
 
1 The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s 
Renewed Bail Application. (See Dkt. 97, Exhibit O.)

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page96 of 165

6 
 
of Ms. Maxwell’s London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired. 
The asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and 
must approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of 
disbursements for Ms. Maxwell’s legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil 
litigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization. No illiquid assets may 
be sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor. 
2.   
Other Assets 
The only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (1) the money currently 
held in escrow by Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and 
(2) the roughly $450,000 in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living 
expenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal 
Account, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive 
five-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount 
exceeding $5,000, and the reason for such payment.  Ms. Maxwell’s spouse agrees to be bound 
by these restrictions and reporting requirements. 
The asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or 
disbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above. 
3.   
Selected Asset Monitor 
 
The Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the 
former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the 
position of asset monitor. (Judge Duffey’s bio is attached as Exhibit A.)  Judge Duffey has 
extensive experience evaluating and monitoring funds held in and disbursed from financial

7 
 
accounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her 
spouse, as described above.   
Restraining Ms. Maxwell’s assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under 
the supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds 
could be used to violate the terms of release. 
II.       Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues  
           That Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her 
 
In addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial 
motions now before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.  
Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of 
charges, if not the entire indictment.  Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the 
superseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay, 
and for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s 
constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of 
the Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious 
statements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits.  These 
motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant 
granting bail on the conditions proposed. 
III.   
The Court Should Grant Bail 
 
Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant must be released on personal 
recognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release 
will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of 
any other person or the community.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b).  The enhanced bail package proposed 
by Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 7 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page98 of 165

8 
 
assure her appearance as required.  Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3142(e), 
the Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if 
released, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this 
propensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what 
conditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no 
danger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity.  To 
say that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States 
citizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for 
alleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old 
claims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.2 
The additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package 
previously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms. 
Maxwell’s presence at trial.  The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral 
pledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of 
foreign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds 
can be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and 
former United States Attorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the 
government and the Court.  These cnditions are unique and unprecedented.  They profoundly 
 
2 See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf. People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 
02526/2011(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a 
Paris-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including 
felony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel 
housekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA 
on the accuser’s uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $1 million cash, 24-
hour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards.  After surrendering his 
French passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a 
residence in Manhattan.  See https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/ may/20/dominique-strauss-kahn-new-york-
apartment.

affirm Ms. Maxwell’s earnestness in seeking bail to properly prepare her defense, not to flee.  
The Court should grant bail to Ghislaine Maxwell. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The proposed additional conditions of release—renunciation of foreign citizenship and 
restraint and monitoring of assets by a retired District Court judge—enhance the already 
extraordinarily restrictive bail conditions proposed in Ms. Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bail.  
In combination, these conditions satisfy the Bail Reform Act and reasonably assure Ms. 
Maxwell’s appearance at trial.  To deny Ms. Maxwell bail when such extraordinary and 
restrictive conditions are available would be a miscarriage of justice.

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
 
United States Courthouse 
40 Foley Square 
New York, New York 10007 
 
Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s third 
motion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2021 (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion”).  
(Dkt. No. 160).  On July 14, 2020, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court 
concluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of 
conditions could ensure her appearance in court.  On December 28, 2020, after the defendant 
renewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her 
prior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a 
thorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied 
the motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.  
(Dkt. No. 106 at 1-2 (“Dec. Op.”)).  The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2020 decision 
to the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending.  Now, the defendant asks the Court yet 
again to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail 
package the Court previously considered and rejected.  For the reasons set forth below, the Motion 
should be denied.  First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in 
which she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed 
that December opinion to the Second Circuit.  Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction 
to grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the 
defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed 
by the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of 
conditions could ensure her appearance.  The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.   
 
I. 
Background 
 
The Government’s December 16, 2020 opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion 
details the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference 
herein.  (See Dkt. No. 100 at 2-6).  After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for

bail in July 2020, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2020 in which the 
defendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were 
made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.”  (Dec. Op. at 1).  In denying that 
second application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only 
solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination 
of conditions can ensure her appearance.”  (Id. at 1-2).   
 
On January 11, 2021, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing 
the Court’s December 2020 opinion denying the Second Bail Motion.  (Dkt. No. 113).  That appeal 
is pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.  
 
On February 23, 2021, the defendant submitted the Third Bail Motion, in which she 
proposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already 
offered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (1) renunciation of the defendant’s French and 
British citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account 
to be overseen by an asset monitor.   
 
II. 
The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of 
the Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal 
 
The defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the 
proposed conditions.”  (Mot. at 4).  More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the 
exact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as now 
“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions.  (Id. at 2, 8).  However, the Court lacks jurisdiction 
to grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second 
Circuit.   
  
“As a general matter, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional 
significance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its 
control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”  United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 
247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)).  
“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial 
economy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues 
before two courts at the same time.’”  Rodgers, 101 F.3d at 251 (quoting United States v. Salerno, 
868 F.2d 524, 540 (2d Cir. 1989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir. 
1989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial 
and appellate courts”).  
 
In January 2021, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2020 
Opinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion.  The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only 
seeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional 
bail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion, 
(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure 
her appearance.”  (Dec. Op. at 16).  Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns 
bail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.”  Rodgers, 101 F.3d at 251.  The 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 2 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page103 of 165

Page 3 
 
 
defendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court.  To 
allow her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy 
underpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal.  See Rodgers, 101 
F.3d at 251.1 
 
The Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant 
without a remedy.  The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to 
this Court.  Alternatively, the Court can follow the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief 
“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, 
the court may: (1) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it 
would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a 
substantial issue.”  However, the defendant should not be permitted to simultaneously pursue bail 
in both this Court and the Second Circuit. 
 
III. 
The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail 
Decisions 
 
Even if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be 
denied.  This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of 
flight.  In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, 
                                                 
1 While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court 
is confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not 
presently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion.  In addition to the rule articulated by 
the Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an 
appeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on 
a motion to amend the Section 2255 motion.  298 F.3d 174, 180 n.5 (2d Cir. 2002) (“The district 
court could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second 
Circuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”).  Here, too, 
while the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should 
not grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling.  Rule 9 of the Federal 
Rules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a 
reading.  Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party 
entitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of 
conviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in 
the court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of 
conviction.”  In United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2000), the Second Circuit found 
that Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal 
from the judgment of conviction is filed.  Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of 
conviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after 
a notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed.  In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court 
of appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal.  Such promptness would not 
be necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the 
bail appeal is pending.

are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the 
Government, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the 
Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does 
not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to 
whom she now asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”  
(Dec. Op. at 2).  In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two 
additional bail conditions.  Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s 
appearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an 
extreme flight risk.  Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that 
her pretrial motions have somehow weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been 
adjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the 
defendant’s motions have no merit.   
 
In short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
continue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any 
information that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.  
 
A. Applicable Law   
 
“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably 
assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if 
‘information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a 
material bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.”  (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)).  “A court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent authority, 
even where the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)’s statutory text.”  (Id. at 5).  Although courts 
in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence 
proffered on reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United 
States v. Rowe, No. 02 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003), 
generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for 
example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or 
that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”  United States v. Petrov, No. 15 
Cr. 66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015). 
 
B. Discussion 
 
The defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing.  First, the 
defendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she 
will flee from prosecution.  Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a 
monitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained 
assets.  Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the 
strength of the Government’s case.  None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should 
be denied.

1. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship 
Should Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations 
 
 
 
The defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by 
offering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.”  (Mot. at 2).  She claims 
that such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the 
United Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to 
seek refuge in those countries.”  (Id. at 2, 5).  The defendant is wrong.  That she is “willing” to 
renounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then 
fighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could 
choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does 
not have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible.  The Court previously 
found that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . . 
. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at 13); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis 
to disturb this finding.  Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition 
waivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential 
extradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship. 
 
First, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.  
As an initial matter, the defendant’s offer is itself of little value, as she would at bare minimum 
have to follow the legal requirements attendant to each country in order to formally renounce her 
citizenship.  Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the 
validity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United 
Kingdom.  For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British 
citizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s 
in your best interest).”  See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality.  The defendant could choose 
to frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her 
citizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.  
Simply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship now, 
there is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in 
the future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time.  And even if the defendant could not 
challenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate matter, she could seek to have her 
citizenship rights restored.  
 
Second, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer 
to renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she 
reckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of 
her extradition rights.  See United States v. Cohen, No. 10 Cr. 547 (SI), 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 
n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his 
Israeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or 
travel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees 
overseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk. 
Defendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable 
in Israel if defendant were to flee there.”).  The Court placed “little weight” on the defendant’s 
argument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 5 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page106 of 165

Page 6 
 
 
her intent not to flee.  (Dec. Op. at 13 n.2).  The Court recognized that “a defendant could 
strategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent 
extradition that might result.”  (Id.).  So too here.  An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship 
“[s]hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but 
hollow offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom 
or France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee). 
 
As such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the 
United Kingdom and France is little more than window dressing.  After receiving the defendant’s 
Third Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International 
Affairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the 
defendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to 
deport its own citizens for crimes they have committed.  In response, the MOJ provided the 
Government with a letter setting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the 
defendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from 
France because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged 
offense was committed.  That letter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the 
letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said 
offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of 
nationality.”); see also Dkt. No. 100, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ letter stating that the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality 
at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”).  The defendant’s 
renunciation of her French citizenship in 2021 would not change the fact that she was a French 
citizen at the time she is alleged to have committed the charged crimes in the 1990s and 2016.  As 
such, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from 
France, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless. 
 
Meanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she 
will not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United 
Kingdom would be successful.  The Government understands from OIA that a defendant’s 
nationality has historically played little to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom.  Indeed, 
Article 3 of the 2003 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom 
expressly 
prohibits 
using 
nationality 
as 
a 
basis 
to 
deny 
extradition. 
 
See 
https://www.congress.gov/108/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-108tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be 
refused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Crown Prosecution Service, 
Extradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May 12, 2020), 
https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (setting forth the statutory bars to extradition, 
which do not include nationality).  In any event, assuming the Government could locate and 
apprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the 
Second Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on 
extradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the 
passage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.  The 
Government understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently 
extensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.  This process is lengthy, 
complicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 6 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page107 of 165

Page 7 
 
 
would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. 
 
As the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant 
could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.  (Dkt. No. 
100 at 19-20).  Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute 
anticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any 
extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.”  (Dec. Op. at 13).  The Court further noted 
that the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even 
if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor 
of detention.”  (Id.).  That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer 
to renounce her foreign citizenship. 
 
As this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial 
and personal connections abroad, and owns at least one foreign property of significant value.  (Dec. 
Op. at 10-11).  The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not 
fundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.   
 
2.  The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition 
 
 
 
Next, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new 
account that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States 
Attorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”  
(Mot. at 2).  This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure 
that the defendant appears in Court.  
 
 
 
It first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about 
those finances— is not an issue of first impression.  Significantly absent from the defendant’s 
Motion is any attempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor 
raises significant concerns as to whether the Court has now been provided a full and accurate 
picture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of 
release.”  (Dec. Op. at 16).  That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would 
depend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances 
and access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth.  Given the Court’s concerns about the 
defendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with 
a monitor under her employ. 
 
In any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her 
assets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets 
unrestrained.  In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million 
townhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself.  Although the defendant 
asserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the 
defendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain how the monitor—or this 
Court—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic 
account.  As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically 
recover assets abroad.  Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 7 of 9
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page108 of 165

Page 8 
 
 
least $2 million.  In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million 
dollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.2  That figure 
appears to be in addition to the approximately $1 million in “chattels” the defendant has disclosed 
among her various assets.  See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9.  In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave 
her with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.  
 
 
 
Further still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship 
program she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court 
has to establish and oversee such a monitorship.  Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the 
Motion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a 
monitorship.  Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a 
program would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the 
funds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access.  Given that the 
defendant’s Motion suggests that attorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears 
that the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject 
only to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.  
 
Finally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she 
would pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.  
As a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and 
the monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest.  But at 
bottom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to 
flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.     
 
In sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid 
about her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal.  (Dec. Op. 
at 2).  Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant 
poses a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution.  The 
Court should reject the proposed bail conditions. 
 
3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength 
of the Government’s Case 
 
 
 
Finally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions now 
before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.”  (Mot. at 7).  
But the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that 
the strength of the Government’s case has diminished.  To the contrary, as the Government has set 
forth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely 
without merit.  In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—
which have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original 
                                                 
2 The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrow for the 
defendant’s legal fees.  See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees); 
see also Mot. at 6.  If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to 
return those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.

determination that the Government’s case is strong.  
 
IV. 
Conclusion  
 
The defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight.  (Dec. Op. at 1).  Even 
assuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions 
offer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already 
found that the defendant poses.  (Id. at 21).  The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.

Through Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate on behalf of the

I hereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are 
governed by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 
Article 696-2 of said Code provides that: “The French government is able to remit to 
foreign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a 
lawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said 
requesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic.” 
 
Article 694-4 expressly specifies as follows: 
 
“Removal is not granted: 
 
1- When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been 
assessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being 
requested.” 
 
WHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an 
insuperable obstacle to his/her removal. As long as said nationality is assessed at the time the 
offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent to said offense has no bearing upon 
the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of nationality.

Preliminary Statement 
 
 
The issue before the Court, as it has been since Ms. Maxwell’s first bail application, 
is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance at trial.  
On her third application (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.160), Ms. Maxwell has put before 
the Court significant enhancements to the already extraordinary bail package previously 
presented to the Court in her renewed application for bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) 
(Dkt. 97).1  Together, these two motions present a unique and comprehensive bail package 
with the strictest of conditions known in any bail application: 
§ $28.5 million in bonds (including a $1M bond co-signed by a security 
company); 
 
§ $9.5 million in real property; 
§ $550,000 in cash; 
§ Asset Monitoring by a retired federal district court judge; 
§ Renunciation of British and French citizenship; 
§ Irrevocable written waivers of the right to contest extradition; 
§ Surrender of all travel documents; 
§ Home confinement in New York City; 
§ Electronic GPS monitoring; 
§ In-residence third-party custodian;2 
 
1 Ms. Maxwell’s present motion (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.160) incorporates her Memorandum in Support of 
Her Renewed Motion for Bail and accompanying exhibits (Dkt. 97, including Attachments 1-24) and her Reply 
Memorandum in Support of Her Renewed Motion for Bail (Dkt. 103, including Attachments 1-2) (collectively, the 
“Second Bail Motion”).  
 
2 To assist Ms. Maxwell in making up for lost time preparing for her upcoming trial, one of her lawyers (not trial 
counsel) has agreed to reside with her and serve as an additional residential custodian.

Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page115 of 165

§ On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the 
residence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to 
escort her when authorized to leave the residence; 
 
§ Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services; 
§ Strict supervision by Pretrial Services; 
§ Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate. 
The government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and 
offering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the 
merits of Ms. Maxwell’s exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has, 
including the assets of her spouse and the financial security of her family and closest 
friends.   
The Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Matters Related to Bail 
The government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion 
because appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the 
Second Circuit. (Dkt. 165 at 2-3).  It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it 
created this problem by opposing  Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a 
notice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion.  Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought 
the extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. 109). The government should not now be allowed to 
turn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the 
instant motion. 
Divestiture of jurisdiction in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per se 
rule. Rather, it is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy that is 
designed to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two 
courts at the same time. Divestiture of jurisdiction, therefore, should not be automatic, but 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 3 of 18

instead guided by concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a 
district court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case 
involved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996). Were it so, a 
district court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant 
released while the government appeals the grant of bail.   Such a rule would detract from, rather 
than promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice. 
         Should the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail 
motion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without 
prejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the 
present bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits, 
Ms. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals. 
Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release 
 
Relying on a letter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the 
Court to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.  
But the letter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The letter asserts that the loss of 
French nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have committed 
does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the 
time of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request.  As discussed in 
the opinion from William Julié, French legal counsel (attached as Exhibit A), the 
government’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the following reasons: 
§ The government’s argument goes against the letter of the law. 
§ The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law. 
§ The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law. 
(Julié Opinion ¶¶ 6-26).

The language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the 
applicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of 
French citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.  (Id. ¶ 11).  
The provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the 
person whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship.  To the contrary, it was 
designed to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the 
commission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of 
offenders seeking to escape extradition.”  (Id. ¶¶ 15-16).  If the person is no longer a French 
national at the time of the request, the provision does not apply.  The government cites no case 
where the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition, 
and we have found none ourselves.  (Id. ¶¶ 19-21).  By contrast, there are numerous examples 
of French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality following the 
commission of an offense.  (Id. ¶ 21).  Accordingly, Mr. Julié concludes: “[I]t cannot have been 
the intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person 
who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.”  (Id.  
¶ 26). 
Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive 
any and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms. 
Maxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the 
“reasonable assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail.  While we 
maintain that Ms. Maxwell’s written waivers of the right to challenge extradition should 
suffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and 
profoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at 
trial.

Monitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release 
 
To address the Court’s concern about Ms. Maxwell’s access to assets, the bail 
motion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail condition – the 
imposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and 
approve expenditures.  Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the 
government urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.   
William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United 
States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by 
the Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring 
funds held in and disbursed from financial accounts.  He has agreed to serve by appointment of 
the Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court 
and are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and 
approve disbursement of assets requiring his signature.  Similar to others who have been 
appointed by courts to oversee financial matters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same 
hourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb). 
The proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and 
monitored by Judge Duffey.  As required by court order, documentation concerning the 
proceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the 
financial account approved by Judge Duffey. 
The government tries to steer the Court’s attention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack 
of candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful 
restraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being 
questioned by Pretrial Services following a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 6 of 18

6 
deprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms. 
Maxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which 
were restricted to her personal assets.  Since then, financial documents - collected and 
professionally vetted by a highly respected accounting firm – have been submitted to the 
government and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning 
Ms. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid 
challenge has been made to those submissions. 
The government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep 
the defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too 
great a risk to release.” (Dkt.165 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it 
undermines most conditions of release.  For example, the same could be said of electronic 
monitoring – i.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place 
him on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to 
release.3 The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act, 
if there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted.  The conditions 
collectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that 
Ms. Maxwell will be present at trial. 
 
 
3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government 
desperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in attorney escrow accounts, would be 
released and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive.  To suggest that defense counsel would 
become accomplices to a violation of a court order shows utter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.  
In particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district 
and establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s 
callous assertion.

Conceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case  
As Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has 
continuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and 
actual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and now to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt. 
165 at 1.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case 
against her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case 
in pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has 
persuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in 
2007, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s 
prosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are 
time-barred.  
The government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light 
of the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that 
either Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-34 to travel while she 
was a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein. 
(See Opp.162-65 & fn. 57-58.)5 Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged 
in the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against 
Ms. Maxwell.  More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it 
produced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to  
obtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that 
undermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire 
 
4 Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” 
 
5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s 
Pre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2021 and not yet publicly filed.

prosecution. 
The ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the 
stale allegations in the indictment.  Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it 
failed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The  
passage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the 
purported strength of the government’s case.  
Bail Must Be Granted 
The detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations – based on the lowest grade 
misdemeanor under New York Penal Law 130.556 – presented in a sensationalized 
indictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy7 –
is unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media 
coverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution, 
has increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued 
detention – providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months–continues to severely 
undermine her presumption of innocence. 
In the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell 
poses “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollow.  The government urges the Court to apply a 
standard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks.  See United States v. 
Orta, 760, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail 
Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under the Bail 
 
6 Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § 130.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a 
class B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation.  
 
7 What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a 
dozen years after the period of the conspiracy alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?

Reform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are "no conditions" that would 
reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened 
by Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets 
monitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.  
To find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old 
woman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made 
America her home for the past 30 years, and who has established strong roots and forged 
important connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous.  The 
concerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed.  To say 
that renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal 
district court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by 
real property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic 
monitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms. 
Maxwell remains in custody – her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based 
on allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who 
are not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength 
and concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her 
confinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for 
trial.8  
 
 
8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic discovery, including discs that can only be 
reviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on 
either the MDC computer or the laptop.  Her receipt of legal mail – including pretrial motions, responses and replies 
– are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC.  The visiting rooms in the 
East Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal 
Defenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of 
installing HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms 
raised early in the pandemic. The alternative – to meet in the open-area where social visiting had been conducted-  
affords no privacy for confidential attorney-client communication, especially under constant oversight by Ms.

Conclusion 
The Court should grant bail for Ms. Maxwell on the extraordinary conditions 
proposed.  Should the Court determine that additional conditions are necessary, Ms. 
Maxwell is willing to satisfy and abide by those terms as well.

Maxwell’s guards and a hand-held camera focused on both Ms. Maxwell and counsel.  Further, confidential 
attorney-client communications conducted during video teleconferencing (VTC)  are now further compromised by 
the repositioning of a camera with sensitive audio recording, putting a chill on privileged communication.  During 
VTC conferences, counsel can hear conversation among the guards, so it is likely that the guards, who seem to be 
writing during those sessions, are able to hear discussions between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Last night, prior to the 
filing of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers 
to provide information bearing on those filings,. Such denial violates the BOP’s Program Statement pertaining to 
providing legal calls upon request of pretrial inmates. See https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/7331_004.pdf at 
par. 24(c). The chronic difficulties related to Ms. Maxwell’s review of the millions of documents of electronic 
discovery are continuing to negatively impact her ability to prepare for a trial that is only a few months away.

Re: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government 
 
1. This memorandum was written pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at 
the French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as 
counsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail 
proceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”), 
where Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in 
sexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from 1994 to 1997. 
 
2. In a previous opinion, I have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute 
an extradition request against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the 
USA and France, without violating any superior norm of French and international law.  
 
3. As I understand the defendant’s French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court 
as a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to 
renounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court 
so requires. 
 
4. In a letter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2021, the Head of the International 
Criminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaeglé, 
asserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is 
alleged to have committed does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, 
as nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the 
time of the extradition request.  
 
5. This report was written to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the 
proposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an 
extradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national. 
 
6. The Ministry of Justice’s assertion must be regarded as incorrect for three reasons: 
 
(i) It is not supported by the letter of the law; 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 13 of 18

(ii) Nor is it supported by the spirit of the law; 
(iii) Case law and precedents in fact suggest the opposite. 
 
7. First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the letter of the law.  
 
8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty 
between the USA and France of 23 April 1996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure for matters not dealt with under the Treaty. 1 
 
9. Article 3(1) of the Treaty provides: 
 
“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person 
who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United 
States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if, in its 
discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be 
the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed”.  
 
10. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule, 
under similar wording: 
 
“Extradition shall not be granted: 
1° When the person claimed has French nationality, the latter being assessed at the time 
of the offense for which extradition is requested”  
 
11. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where 
French authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French 
national at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of 
 
1 Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of 
America and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2003, and the Instrument Amending the 
Treaty of 23 April 1996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 30 September 
2004.

Criminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested 
State”/”the person claimed has French nationality”), which can only mean that the 
extradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national. If the 
person is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not 
apply.  
 
12. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French 
nationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have 
expressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to 
qualify the national affiliation of the requested person.  
 
13. Furthermore, it is a well-known principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions 
that exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an 
exception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application 
to a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.  
 
14. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law 
 
15. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact 
not intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but 
only in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the 
commission of the alleged crime.  
 
16. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for 
which extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French 
nationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after committing an 
offence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to 
escape extradition.

17. This concern over opportunistic nationality applications is precisely the justification of 
the rule mentioned in academic literature (see for example Répertoire de droit pénal et 
de procédure pénale Extradition Pén. – Conditions de fond de l'extradition – 
Delphine Brach-Thiel–October 2018, §59). 
 
18. Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents 
and case law 
 
19. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case 
can be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied 
to protect a formerly French national from extradition.  
 
20. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,1° of the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against 
an individual who had acquired French nationality after committing an offence, which 
is the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber 
of the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2006, n°05-86.258). 
 
21. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the 
extradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where 
French authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French 
nationality. Both extradition and deportation allow for the removal of a person from 
French territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with 
the consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.  
 
22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”) treats extradition and deportation 
analogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars 
apply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court 
considers that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 
3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The 
Court’s own case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between

extradition and other removals”, ECtHR 12 April 2012, Babar Ahmad and Others v. 
the United Kingdom, no. 24027/07, §168).  
 
23. France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by 
application of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may 
give rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen 
named Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of 
terrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality2.  
 
24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of 
prison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used 
to be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits 
State parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which 
they remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment3. Beghal 
was eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose 
of standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel 
Beghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allow for his removal from 
France, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were 
conceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time 
of the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to 
deported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.  
 
25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shows that the loss of French 
nationality prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are 
intended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.

26.  In these circumstances, it cannot have been the intention of French lawmakers that 
Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure be construed as meaning that 
a person who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from 
extradition since the French government has on several occasions deported to third 
countries individuals who had been deprived of their French nationality following the 
commission of criminal offences.

ORDER 
 
 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges 
of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.   
On July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant 
was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her 
appearance.  It therefore denied bail.  On December 8, 2020, the Defendant filed a renewed 
motion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December 
14, 2020.  Dkt. No. 96.  On December 28, 2020, the Court denied that motion, concluding that 
the Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her 
appearance.  Dkt. Nos. 104, 106.   
The Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2021.  Dkt. 
No. 160.  In this motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the reasons that the Court

provided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her 
second motion for bail.  Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship, 
and she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be 
monitored by a retired federal judge.  See Dkt. No. 160 at 2.   
As set forth below, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and 
proposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no 
combination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance.  Thus, for substantially the 
same reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the 
Court DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail. 
I. 
Background 
On July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.  
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in 
18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a 
flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  The 
Defendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
The Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2020.  The Court 
again denied the Defendant’s motion.  In doing so, the Court explained that none of the 
Defendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of 
flight.  It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry 
lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, 
including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s 
substantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for

escape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations 
raised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.  
See Dkt. No. 106.  
On February 23, 2021, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail.  Dkt. No. 
160 (“Def. Mot.”).  The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2021.  Dkt. 
No. 165 (“Gov’t Opp’n”).  The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March 16, 
2021. 
II. 
Legal Standard 
The parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from 
granting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending.  See Gov’t 
Opp’n at 2–3; Reply at 2–3; see also United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(“As a general matter, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—
it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over 
those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omitted).  Under Rule 37(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer 
considering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court 
of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 
37(a).  Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of 
whether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.   
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq.  The Bail Reform Act 
requires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or 
combination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 3 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page135 of 165

 
 
 
4 
person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B).  The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after 
considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that “no condition 
or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and 
the safety of any other person and the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). 
 
After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allows the 
Court to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not known to the movant at the 
time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is 
warranted.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new 
information would not have a material bearing on the issue.  See United States v. Raniere, No. 
18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2018) (noting that 
“[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v. 
Havens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing 
because the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant 
until trial).  In addition, the Court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)’s statutory text.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) 
(noting that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v. 
Petrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).

If, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense 
specifically enumerated in § 3142(e)(3), a rebuttable presumption arises “that no condition or 
combination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the 
community or others.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3).  In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a 
limited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that 
he does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”  United States v. English, 629 
F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 
2001)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) (“[A] defendant must 
introduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).  
Nonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing 
evidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”  English, 629 F.3d at 
319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 
(2d Cir. 1986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).  
Even when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” however, “the presumption favoring 
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed 
by the district court.”  United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290–91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
III. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent powers to review 
its own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of 
the Court’s earlier rulings.  See Def. Mot. at 4.  She also argues that the strength of the 
Government’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions, 
which are currently pending before the Court.  Id. at 7.  Having considered those arguments, the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 5 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page137 of 165

 
 
 
6 
Court’s view has not changed.  The Court again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no 
set of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to 
reasonably assure her appearance.  The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the 
evidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that 
conclusion.  The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.    
A. The Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors has not changed 
To begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.  
See Dkt. No. 106 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7–8.  And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant 
has met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among 
those weighed by the district court.”  Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 
1144).  The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of 
flight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate 
to secure their appearance.”  Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted).   
The Court’s analysis of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors also remains unchanged.  
Because the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor 
victim, the first 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.  
And the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or 
to the community.  The fourth § 3142(g) factor thus weighs against detention.   
With respect to the second § 3142(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter 
the Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.  The Defendant argues that the pre-trial 
motions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire 
indictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 6 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page138 of 165

 
 
 
7 
of the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.”  Def. Mot. at 7.  
Those motions became fully briefed one week ago and are now pending before this Court.  The 
Government strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated 
them.  Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the 
presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength 
and nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.  See Dec. 
Op. at 9–10.   
 The Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.  
See Dec. Op. at 10–16.  The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial 
and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading 
detection.  Id. at 10–11.  And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor 
regarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same.  As the Court 
emphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the 
information presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2020 and the information 
presented to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about candor.  See Dec. Op. 
at 16.  There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of 
conditions of release.  Id.  While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in 
the opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not 
overcome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.   
As a result, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter 
the Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors.  While the fourth factor continues to 
favor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion

8 
that the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight.  Thus, the Court again concludes that there 
are no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.  
B. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
The thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new 
proposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight.  The Defendant first 
offers to renounce her French and British citizenship.  Def. Mot. at 2.  And she also proposes to 
have most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a 
retired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority 
over the account.  Id.  Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed 
in December.  See Dec. Op. at 16–17; see also Def. Mot. at 2.  The new bail package does not 
disturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of showing that these 
conditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set 
of conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance. 
The Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom 
citizenship.  She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of 
bail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while 
not immediate, may be expedited.”  Def. Mot. at 4.  As the Government notes, the offer is of 
unclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.  
See Gov’t Opp’n at 5.  With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is 
again confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law.  The 
Government relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of 
the French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French 
national constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 8 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page140 of 165

 
 
 
9 
nationality is assessed at the time the offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent 
to said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said 
assessment of nationality.”1  Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.  The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the 
opinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the 
extradition request.  See Reply, Ex. A ¶ 11.  The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no 
case law addressing this precise issue.  Id. ¶ 21.   
Exacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend 
themselves to multiple interpretations.  For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between 
the United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the 
Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but 
the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the 
United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so.  The nationality of the person 
sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed.”  See Reply, 
Ex. A ¶ 9 (emphasis added)).  Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly 
provides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French 
nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is 
requested.”2  Id. ¶ 10; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.  Thus, there is considerable uncertainty 
as to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her 
ability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition.  The Court’s assessment of the risks largely 
 
1 The Court cites the translated version of the letter, though the original letter is in French.   
2 Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations.  The 
translated letter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual 
claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the 
offense on the basis of which removal is being requested.”  Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 9 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page141 of 165

 
 
 
10 
parallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition 
waiver.  See Dec. Op. at 12–13.   
Similar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship.  The 
Court is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce 
her UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK.  See 
Gov’t Opp’n at 6–7.  And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the 
proposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the 
Defendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition attempts.  The 
possibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the 
Defendant’s incentive to flee. 
To summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship 
does not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant 
poses.  Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the 
renunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of 
whether the Defendant poses a risk of flight.  See United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547 (SI), 
2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010).  And that same uncertainty—and the 
possibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes 
flight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.  
Nor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no 
condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.  The 
Defendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial 
affairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve 
disbursement of assets requiring his signature.  See Reply at 5.  The Court continues to have 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 10 of 12
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page142 of 165

 
 
 
11 
concerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of 
the lack of transparency when she was first arrested.  But the Court assumes, for purposes of 
resolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it 
accounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets.  See Dec. Op. at 16–17.   
The monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, 
even when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package.  The Defendant 
would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to 
evade prosecution.  These include the $450,000 that the Defendant would retain for living 
expenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry 
and other chattels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  See Def. Mot. at 
5–6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9.  While those amounts may be a small percentage of the 
Defendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate 
flight.  When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3142(g) factors and the presumption 
of detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its 
conclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.  
If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the 
Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.  Yet while her proposed bail package 
is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances.  As a result, the Court again 
determines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis.  18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(1).

                     20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
 
The government’s recent letter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.158) essentially repeats 
the same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing 
the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays.  We appreciate the 
Court’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to 
which she is required to undergo searches. The government’s letter, however, does not include 
the concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In 
addition, the letter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by 
counsel have been denied.   
 
By ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s letter 
misrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement.  Ms. Maxwell does not have access to 
daily discovery review for the entirety of the 13 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her 
the 50 feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.   
 
The number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move, 
including to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently, 
she is subject to a minimum of four pat down searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat down 
searches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6th, Ms. Maxwell has been physically 
searched approximately 1400 times, including pat down searches, metal wand searches, mouth, 
hair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 60 body 
scans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker, 
legal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.  
 
We take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety 
of the institution and the defendant.”  Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six 
guards and approximately 18 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her 
throughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to 
anyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP 
negligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

As the government states, a flashlight is pointed at the ceiling of her isolation cell every 
15 minutes, from approximately 9:30 pm to 6:30 am.  It is hard to verbally convey the power of a 
light that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s 
eyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night.  The attenuating effects of sleep 
deprivation are well documented.   
 
Ms. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who 
are used to guarding hundreds of inmates but now focus their undivided attention exclusively on 
one respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security 
camera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat down 
search.  When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.” 
When Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she 
was threatened with disciplinary action.  Within a week and while the same team was in charge, 
Ms. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms. 
Maxwell into a shower to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom.  Ms. Maxwell’s 
request to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again 
denied.  
 
Ms. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily 
removal is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted.  Despite claims by MDC Legal 
to the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot 
cell: she is not allowed to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation 
cell, and within two feet from the door.  This directive encroaches on an already restricted and 
confined area and limits her movement and use to the little space that remains.   
 
Ms. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her.  She has 
repeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal.  For the duration of her detention, she 
has never received a properly heated meal.  Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-
indicated for use in a microwave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microwave 
oven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts 
the plastic container, rendering the food inedible.  While guards finally acknowledged serious 
problems with the food, they continued to microwave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food 
inedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no 
replacement.  Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be 
heated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it 
does little to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her 
health.  
 
Recently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water.  The water 
in the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was brown. 
Requests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her bottled water or permit her to purchase 
water were denied.  In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily 
newspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP 
system, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.

It is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms. 
Maxwell is detained.  Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide 
watch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any 
psychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.   
For weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal 
calls, and the opportunity to exercise and shower. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a 
recurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death.  Contrary to the way she is 
hyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CC1-Mh designation: inmate with 
no significant mental health care. 
 
The overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s 
health and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self – losing weight, 
losing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate.  In addition to the many difficulties impacting 
her review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her 
stamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel. 
 
Having been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by 
two to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move, 
except when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that 
Ms. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”

Memorandum Opinion and Order

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO 
 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
No. 17-CR-02949-MV-1 
v. 
 
DASHAWN ROBERTSON,  
 
 
Defendant. 
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 
 
 
THIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to 
Reconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.  Doc. 274.  The 
government filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. Robertson filed a reply  [Doc. 284].  
The United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr. 
Robertson’s release.  Docs. 277 and 287.  The Court then discussed the motion at length with the 
parties and the USPO at the February 4, 2021 pretrial conference in this case.  Doc. 297 at 4–6.  
After carefully considering the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight of the 
evidence against Mr. Robertson, his history and characteristics, and the potential danger to the 
community posed by his release, the Court found that a combination of extremely strict conditions 
could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance in court and the safety of the community, as 
required by 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  Id. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson’s release was 
necessary to allow him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) 
because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or 
communicate with his attorneys.  Id.  The Court accordingly ordered Mr. Robertson to be released 
under strict conditions to La Pasada Halfway House on February 5, 2021.  See Docs. 300 and 301.

In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court explains its release analysis under the 
Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3142.  It also explains its decision to deny the government’s 
Amended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order.  Doc. 298.   
BACKGROUND 
 
 
Mr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of 
Justice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1513(a)(1)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924.  Doc. 86.  The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting 
an individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September 12, 2017 in 
retaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.  
See Doc. 38 at 2.  Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December 
11, 2017 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2021, about two months from today. 
 
Although presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention 
in this case for over three years.  He was arrested on December 11, 2017 and was ordered detained 
the same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no 
condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the 
community or his appearance in court.  Doc. 12.  Extensive pretrial litigation followed until the 
case was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2020.  Doc. 63.  The Court held a pretrial 
conference on March 10, 2020 and testimonial writs were issued.  Docs. 127 and 143.  Just days 
later, however, the devastating extent of the global COVID-19 pandemic became clear and the 
Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil 
and criminal jury trials set for the following month.  See In the Matter of: Court Operations in 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 2 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page151 of 165

Light of the Coronavirus Outbreak, 20-MC-00004-9 (D.N.M. Mar. 13, 2020) (Johnson, C.J.).  
Almost a full year later, jury trials remain suspended in the District of New Mexico.  See In the 
Matter of: Superseding Administrative Order 20-MC-00004-49, 21-MC-00004-04 (D.N.M. Jan. 
15, 2021) (Johnson, C.J.) (continuing the suspension of all civil and criminal jury trials through at 
least February 28, 2021).   
In the intervening 11 months, Mr. Robertson has remained in custody.  During that time 
period, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in 
December 2020 and February 2021.  See, e.g., Doc. 271.  Mr. Robertson’s trial will now be reset 
for April 5, 2021, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme 
and unprecedented delay he has endured.  Complicating matters, however, is the fact that the 
pandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr. 
Robertson’s defense team: both of his original attorneys withdrew from the case in January of this 
year.  Doc. 295.  As a result, the attorneys with which he will be going to trial in two months were 
appointed in September 2020 and January 2021.  Docs. 197 and 293.  Although the Court would 
not have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. Robertson’s new attorneys would be 
ready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust, 
preparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a matter of months.   
Mr. Robertson first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year.  Doc. 181. 
He argued that his continued pretrial detention posed a risk to his health because his compromised 
immune system makes him especially vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-19.  Id. 
at 5.  He also argued that there were conditions of release that would satisfy the requirements of 
the Bail Reform Act, including the designation of his father as a third-party custodian.  Id. at 9–
10.  The Court took up the motion at a status conference held on September 11, 2020.  It explained

that it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. Robertson had been in custody up to 
that point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in 
jail had been further reduced by the pandemic.  Transcript of September 11, 2020 Status 
Conference at 43–44.1  The Court nevertheless found that it did not have any conditions available 
that could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance or the safety of the community given his 
failure to comply with conditions of release in the past.  Id. at 44–45.  The Court also noted that 
while it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his attorneys to prepare for trial 
during the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in 
conference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque.  Id. at 45. 
Mr. Robertson now asks the Court to reconsider its earlier decision denying him pretrial 
release.  Doc. 274.  As grounds for reconsideration, he points to the additional unforeseen trial 
continuances following the September status conference as well as new placement options, 
including the grandmother of his children and La Pasada Halfway House.  Id.; see also Doc. 284 
at 2–3.  The government opposes the requested reconsideration.  Doc. 282.   
DISCUSSION 
I. 
Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.   
 
As an initial matter, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider 
its earlier release decision.  As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this 
Circuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion 
for reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases.  See United States v. Christy, 739 
F.3d 534, 539 (10th Cir. 2014).  A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to 
entry of final judgment.  See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d 1241, 1243 (10th Cir.

1991) (“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a ‘motion to reconsider.’  Instead, 
the rules allow a litigant subject to an adverse judgment to file either a motion to alter or amend 
the judgment . . .  or a motion seeking relief from the judgment.”); Trujillo v. Bd. of Educ. of 
Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 212 F. App’x 760, 765 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (“A district court 
has discretion to revise interlocutory orders prior to entry of final judgment.”).  Hence, “[w]hen a 
party seeks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion is considered ‘an 
interlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to review and 
revise interlocutory rulings prior to entry of final judgment.’”  Wagner Equip. Co. v. Wood, 289 
F.R.D. 347, 349 (D.N.M. 2013) (quoting Wagoner v. Wagoner, 938 F.2d 1120, 1122 n.1 (10th Cir. 
1991)).  The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court 
should have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.”  Christy, 739 F.3d at 539. 
Consequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to 
reconsider.”  Federated Towing & Recovery, LLC v. Praetorian Ins. Co., 283 F.R.D. 644, 651 
(D.N.M. 2012) (citing Phelps v. Hamilton, 122 F.3d 1309, 1324 (10th Cir. 1997)).  
The scope of reconsideration, however, is narrowly cabined and far more limited than in 
an ordinary appeal.  That is, a motion to reconsider is an “inappropriate vehicle[] to reargue an 
issue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances new arguments, or 
supporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.”  Servants of Paraclete 
v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  Rather, “[g]rounds warranting 
a motion to reconsider include (1) an intervening change in the controlling law, (2) new evidence 
previously unavailable, and (3) the need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice.”  Id. 
 
Here, several pieces of previously unavailable evidence justify the request for 
reconsideration.  Servants of Paraclete, 204 F.3d at 1012.  First, when the Court denied Mr. 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 5 of 16

Robertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial 
detention for three additional months until a December 7, 2020 trial date.  Doc. 194.  As bad as 
the pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a 
state of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more 
to the current April 5, 2021 trial date.  Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last 
September, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his attorneys in person 
in conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the 
defense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial.  See supra at 4.  The Court’s impression on 
that point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with attorneys and 
then bringing COVID-19 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted attorney-client meetings at 
the Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected.  Third, the Court is now able to impose 
significantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La 
Pasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September. 
II. 
Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict 
and Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and 
the Safety of the Community Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). 
 
 
On the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s 
recommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the 
information contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the 
applicable law.  Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately 
believes that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community 
by releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully 
tailored conditions.   
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 6 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page155 of 165

hearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably 
assure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the 
community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by 
a preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear 
and convincing evidence.  United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 616 (10th Cir. 2003).  A district 
court’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo.  See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at 
616.  
Section 3142(e)(2) creates a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combinations of 
conditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community 
where there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).  See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(B).  As the Tenth Circuit has held: 
Once the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.  
However, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the 
community always remains with the government.  The defendant’s burden of 
production is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced.  Even if a 
defendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for 
consideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain. 
 
United States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d 1353, 1354–55 (10th Cir. 1991). 
Here, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c) 
charge, see Doc. 86 at 1–2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebutted the presumption.  He 
has produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk 
because he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining 
his innocence and knowing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted.  Doc. 274 at 
5.  He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence 
here.  Id.  And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a 
condition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.  
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 7 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page156 of 165

Doc. 284 at 2–3.  Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebutted the presumption 
in § 3142(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for 
his release. 
Section 3142(g) then lays out the following factors for courts to consider: (1) the nature 
and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a 
violation of § 1591, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled 
substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the 
defendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness 
of the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release.  18 
U.S.C. § 3142(g).   
The Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release, 
they do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed.  With regard to the 
nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr. 
Robertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government 
in an earlier criminal case.  As the Court stated at the November 4, 2021 pretrial conference, it 
takes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come 
forward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our 
criminal justice system.   
With regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed.  On the one 
hand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other 
witness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior 
to the shooting.  On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and 
place of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have

been influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who 
came to question him in the hospital.      
With regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past 
conditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last 
September.  See supra at 4.  More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 PSR notes several 
instances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.  
Doc. 188 at 8–10.  Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions.  Id.  However, as the defense 
has pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him 
absconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any 
convictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case.  Id.; 
see also Doc. 274 at 4–5.   
Finally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any 
person or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s 
concerns given the frightening allegations in this case.  Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all 
charges until proven guilty, however.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) (“Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”).  Presuming Mr. Robertson’s 
innocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and 
has failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history 
of violent behavior.2  Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr. 
Robertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided 
no concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims.  For example, the government’s 
cryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case 
 
2 While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are 
therefore unproven allegations.  See Doc. 188 at 11–15.

is not a valid reason to deny Mr. Robertson release because the government has not come forward 
with any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. Robertson to the alleged contact. 
More importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully 
tailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr. 
Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community.  Mr. Robertson will be placed at La 
Pasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the 
strictest form of location monitoring available to the Court.  Doc. 301 at 2.  He will not be allowed 
to leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his attorneys, and he will not be allowed 
to transport himself to those meetings; his attorneys will have to transport him.  Id.  He will not be 
allowed any visitors at La Pasada except for his attorneys.  Id.  He will not be allowed to use or 
possess a cellphone, nor to borrow anyone else’s cellphone.  Id.  He will not be allowed to use the 
landline at La Pasada, except to speak to his attorneys.  Id.  He will not be allowed to have contact 
with anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his attorneys.  Id.  That includes no contact 
with his family members until he shows the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his 
conditions of release.  Id.  He will not be allowed to use or possess drugs or alcohol.  Id.  He will 
be allowed to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming 
trial.  Id.  He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, however 
small.  Id.   
The Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the 
staff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. Robertson will not pose a danger to the 
community or a risk of flight.  The Court also cautioned Mr. Robertson at the February 4, 2021 
pretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate 
to reincarcerate him immediately.  The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 10 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page159 of 165

11 
 
combination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety 
of any person and the community.  His pretrial release is therefore required by 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).   
III. 
Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense 
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). 
 
The Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation 
of his trial defense under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i).  That section allows a judicial officer who issued an 
order of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the 
custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial 
officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for 
another compelling reason.”  § 3142(i).3  The defendant bears the burden of establishing their 
entitlement to temporary release under § 3142(i).  United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 
1155 (D. Kan. 2020) (citation omitted).  Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary 
for the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(1) [the] time and opportunity the 
defendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the 
case and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing 
while incarcerated.”  United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:19-CR-00301-GMN-
DJA, 2020 WL 1639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2020) (unreported) (citations omitted). 
Here, all of those factors weigh in favor of release.  Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be 
reset for April 5, 2021, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.  
 
3 While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr. 
Robertson’s initial order of detention, this matter is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the 
Court review that detention order under 18 U.S.C. § 3145(b).  See Doc. 274 at 1.  The Tenth Circuit has not 
yet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) can only be decided by the 
Magistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention.  See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 240, 
268 (D.N.M. 2020).  But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial 
release under that section.  See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66–68 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) 
(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268. 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 11 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page160 of 165

12 
 
Complicating matters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense attorneys have 
recently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current attorneys have been appointed within 
the past six months (one in the last three weeks).  The defense team therefore has a considerable 
amount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to 
immediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis.  The case is also complex and 
exceedingly serious.  The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc. 
104] and the Court has issued upwards of 30 written orders over the past three years of contentious 
pretrial litigation in this case.  And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing 
decades in prison: according to his Form 13 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range 
would be a staggering 412 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 40 years.  See 
Doc. 188 at 15.   
Finally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be 
impossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under 
the current lockdown conditions due to COVID-19.  In normal times, defense counsel can meet 
with their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and 
do other critical trial preparation.  Now, however, if the jails are allowing in-person client meetings 
at all, it is with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible 
to effectively review documentary evidence.  And while defense counsel represented that the Santa 
Fe County Detention Center is allowing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time 
due to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them 
(including this Court).  Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been 
helpful, the Detention Center has not allowed them to show Mr. Robertson documents by sharing 
their screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 12 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page161 of 165

13 
 
hopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.   
This is no way to prepare for a trial.  The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr. 
Robertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-
consuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and 
making the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference 
between a verdict of guilty and not guilty.  Mr. Robertson’s attorneys also need unobstructed 
access to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial.  They 
need to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if 
necessary.  They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to 
COVID-19.  As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of 
severe outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdowns to ensure the safety of the 
staff and inmates.  The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States 
Marshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well.  None of this will provide 
Mr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally 
entitled.  Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man, 
until it is safe and practically possible for his attorneys to meet with him there.  The status quo is 
no longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.   
§ 3142(i). 
IV. 
The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a 
Stay. 
 
Finally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a 
stay pending appeal.  See Doc. 298.  In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr. 
Robertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of 
information following the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 13 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page162 of 165

14 
 
decision.  First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the 
interview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. Robertson] to meet with his 
attorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during 
business hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.”  Doc. 298 at 2.  There 
is a catch, however: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allow for appropriate 
social distancing between [Mr. Robertson] and his lawyers.”  Id.  Second, the government 
represents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person 
attorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his 
attorneys.”  Id. 
 
While the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these 
alternatives, they do not change its decision on release.  First, the Court notes that the government 
could have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on 
these alternatives to deny release.  Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December 
21, 2020.  Doc. 274.  The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make 
its argument against release.  It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional 
evidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance.   A motion for reconsideration is 
for presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.”  Servants of Paraclete, 204 F.3d 
at 1012.  
 
Second, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns 
the Court has articulated.  The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is 
inadequate because the room, by the government’s own description, will still contain a “screen” 
between Mr. Robertson and his attorneys.  For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team 
cannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 14 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page163 of 165

15 
 
line by line in a way that is not possible through a screen.  The fact that the interview room will be 
unavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has 
been, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the 
Daubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4.  The Court’s calendar is also constantly 
shifting, meaning that the defense team will have little to no ability to confidently predict when 
they will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson.  The proposal involving the Santa Fe County 
Detention Center fares no better.  The government’s language is tellingly equivocal.  First, it states 
that “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person 
attorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.”  Doc. 298 at 1 (emphasis added).  Later, the 
government writes that the jail is willing to allow in-person meetings, but that it will “work to 
accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his attorneys.”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  
Rather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of 
uncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year.  The truth remains that the Santa 
Fe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdown at any 
time due to the continued spread of COVID-19 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more 
infectious variants).  The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of 
COVID-19 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety 
practices.  Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the 
consistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense attorneys that he needs. 
 
Finally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier 
release order.  Doc. 300.  First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for 
such a stay.  See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority 
in support of legal positions advanced.”).  Second, the Court does not agree that the government 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 15 of 16
Case 21-770, Document 20-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page164 of 165

16 
 
is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal because it believes that Mr. Robertson’s release is 
required by § 3142(e) and permitted by § 3142(i) for all of the reasons stated above.  Nor does the 
Court agree that “[t]here is no immediate need to release [Mr. Robertson] today.”  Doc. 298 at 4.  
As the Court has explained, with Mr. Robertson heading to trial in two months, the defense team 
needs every day it can get to prepare with him, especially if he will be required to quarantine for 
two weeks upon arriving at La Pasada, as was suggested at the pretrial conference. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, Mr. Robertson’s Motion to Reconsider Motion for Review 
of Detention Order and Immediate Release [Doc. 274] is hereby GRANTED.  See also Doc. 300.  
All of the conditions of Mr. Robertson’s release can be found in the Order Setting Conditions of 
Release, filed on February 5, 2021.  Doc. 301.  The government’s Amended Emergency Motion 
for Reconsideration of and Stay of Release Order [Doc. 298] is DENIED. 
DATED this 6th day of February, 2021.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ) 
 
LARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby affirms under penalty of 
perjury: 
1. 
I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of Audrey Strauss, United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and I represent the Government in this 
appeal. I submit this affirmation in support of the Government’s motion to file an unredacted copy 
of Exhibit F, the Government’s Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion 
for Release, under seal.   
2. 
Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant filed publicly a redacted version of Exhibit F, 
which was the version publicly filed on the docket in this case.  (Dkt. No. 100). The redactions to 
that document are narrowly tailored to cover (1) information implicating the privacy interests of 
third parties previously articulated by the defense (Dkt. No. 86), and (2) Confidential Material 
produced by the Government in discovery and governed by the protective order in this case (Dkt. 
No. 36).  The Government believes that some of the redacted information is pertinent to this appeal 
and therefore seeks leave to file an unredacted copy of Exhibit F under seal.

The Government has communicated with counsel for the Defendant-Appellant, 
who does not object to this request. 
4. 
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
