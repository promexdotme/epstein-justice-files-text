Maria Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the executors 
of the Estate Of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Civil Action No.19-cv-10474 
Dear Judge Buchwald, 
We are counsel to non-party Alan Dershowitz (hereinafter "Dershowitz"). We respectfully submit this letter 
in reply to Maria Farmer's (hereinafter "Farmer") response letter [Dkt. No. 10] and in further support of 
Dershowitz' s letter requesting a pre-motion conference [Dkt. No. 9] seeking permission to file a motion for 
limited intervention in order to move to strike redundant, immaterial, impertinent, and scandalous matter 
contained in Farmer's complaint pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f), and separately, move for the imposition 
of sanctions, and an award attorney's fees and costs, against Farmer and her attorneys at Boies Schiller 
Flexner LLP (hereinafter "BSF"). 
Alternatively, Dershowitz requests that the Court exercise its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f)(l) 
to strike the offending content sua sponte, and thereby, render the instant request and proposed motion to 
strike moot. 
Farmer's response letter fails to justify the inclusion of the "redundant, immaterial, impertinent, 
scandalous" matter in paragraph 39 of Farmer's complaint which amounts to little more than a gratuitous 
defamatory "cheap shot" at Dershowitz. In fact, the hyperbolic contents of the response letter is itself 
evidence of the campaign of personal animus waged against Dershowitz by BSF and its clients in court 
filings and beyond. It is ofno importance whether the allegation contained in paragraph 39 of the Farmer's 
complaint was a "surprise" to Dershowitz as Farmer and her attorneys contend. Simply put, the salacious 
allegation has no place in the action filed by Farmer against the named defendants and serves no relevant 
purpose in light of the two causes of action she brings pursuant to New York law: Battery and Intentional 
Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
Under New York law a "civil battery 'is an intentional wrongful physical contact with another person 
without consent' (Rothman v City of New York, 19 CIV. 0225 (CM), 2019 WL 3571051, at *16 [SDNY 
Aug. 5, 2019] citing Charkhy v. Altman, 252 A.D.2d 413,414 [1st Dep't 1998]) and a successful claim for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress "requires a showing of (1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) 
intent to cause, or reckless disregard of a substantial probability of causing, severe emotional distress; (3) 
1 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 11   Filed 12/16/19   Page 2 of 2
a causal connection between the conduct and the injury; and (4) severe emotional distress." (Scotto v. The 
City of New York, 18-CV-04228-LTS, 2019 WL 6701919, at *4 [SDNYDec. 9, 2019] citingBenderv. City 
of New York, 78 F.3d 787, 790 [2d Cir. 1996] Stuto v. Fleishman, 164 F.3d 820, 827 [2d Cir. 1999]). 
Therefore, the allegation against Dershowitz is irrelevant and is of no consequence to Farmer in meeting 
her burden of proof as to the causes of action brought against the defendants. 
In fact, confronted with this fact, Farmer's letter is devoid of any explanation on how the allegation against 
Dershowitz has any relevance to her claims. Plaintiff claims that the allegation is "meant to corroborate 
Plaintiff's story". No corroboration can be gleaned from the gratuitous allegation against Dershowitz. In 
fact, at the trial of this matter, such an allegation would likely be inadmissible on a number of evidentiary 
grounds. 
Farmer cites to Roe v. City of New York, 151 F.Supp.2d 495,510 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) which held "To prevail 
on a motion [to strike] [the movant] must demonstrate that ... the allegations have no bearing on the issues 
in the case ... " Dershowitz has satisfied this criteria. Serving no legitimate purpose, other than to defame 
Dershowitz, the Court should permit Dershowitz to move to strike the allegation from Farmer's complaint 
as it clearly is "redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous" material pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(:t). 
In the alternative, Dershowitz requests that the Court exercise its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 
12(:t)(l) and strike the allegation sua sponte as the Honorable Kenneth A. Marra, United States District 
Court for the Southern District of Florida, did regarding allegations made against Dershowitz in Jane Doe 
1 and 2 v. United States of America, 08-CV-80736-KAM, (2015). 
Finally, Farmer claims that ifDershowitz seeks the imposition of sanctions against Farmer and BSF, and 
an award of attorney's fees and costs, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927 and/or F.R.C.P. Rule 11, it will cause 
undue delay. It should be noted, that a motion for sanctions pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 11 must be made 
separately from a F.R.C.P. Rule 12(:t) motion to strike, and therefore, one is not encumbered by the other. 
In any event, Farmer fails to articulate how such a motion would cause delay and prejll:dice as to her claims 
against the defendants. 
As cited in Dershowitz's initial letter, the Hon. Jose A. Cabranes stated: "Our legal process is already 
susceptible to abuse ... Shielded by the "litigation privilege, " bad actors can defame opponents in court 
pleadings or depositions without fear of lawsuit and liability." (Brown v Maxwell, 929 F3d 41, 47 [2d Cir 
2019]) Dershowitz is a victim of such abuse, and as such, he should be afforded the opportunity to seek 
relief by way of intervention.
