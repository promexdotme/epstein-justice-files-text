Re: 
VE v. Nine East 71st Street, et al., 1:19-cv-07625 (AJN) (DCF) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.  We write to 
further supplement the Co-Executors’ pending motion to dismiss (ECF Doc. 36) with the 
enclosed copy of the Opinion & Order entered today by The Hon. Paul A. Engelmayer in 
another personal injury action against the Co-Executors (Jane Doe 15 v. Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn, as executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 19-civ-10653 (PAE) (DCF)).  
In His Honor’s Opinion & Order, Judge Engelmayer grants the Co-Executors’ motion to dismiss 
the plaintiff’s punitive damages claim against them as a matter of law on grounds applicable to 
Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages in this action.   
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz
