FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
9. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein was an adult male over 
45 years old.  Epstein was tremendously wealthy, widely recognized as a billionaire, who used his 
wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual crimes in violation of federal 
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 2 of 14

3 
and state statutes and to employ and conspire with other individuals and corporate entities to assist 
him in committing those crimes or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
10. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his direction; to the victims 
procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance and carry out and conceal his 
crimes and torts.   
11. 
The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct while at his 
townhouse in New York.   
12. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females as young as 14 years 
old.   
13. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor children, and 
took pleasure corrupting vulnerable young females, including minor children, into engaging in 
sexual acts with him. 
14. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees and 
associates of entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the purpose of harming teenage 
girls through sexual exploitation. 
15. 
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment inclusive of One Count of Sex Trafficking 
Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part due to Epstein’s criminal activities against 
children in the New York Mansion located at 9 East 71st Street.   
16. 
On July 8, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested pursuant to the aforementioned 
Indictment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.    
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 3 of 14

17. 
The Indictment stated in part, and Plaintiff herein adopts as true, that “from at least 
in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, 
enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the “New York Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
“Palm Beach Residence”) to engage in sex acts with him, after which the victims were given 
hundreds of dollars in cash.”  Criminal Indictment at 1. 
18. 
“Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein 
also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN.  In 
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in 
locations including New York and Palm Beach.”  Criminal Indictment at 1-2.   
19. 
“The victims described herein were as young as 14 years old at the time they were 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to 
exploitation.  Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that many of his victims were in 
fact under the age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims expressly told him 
their age.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.  
20. 
“In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to 
sexually abuse and exploit, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, … worked and conspired with others, including 
employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims 
and scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm 
Beach Residence.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.   
21. 
The indictment further explained, and Plaintiff adopts and alleges, that, “[v]ictims 
were initially recruited to provide ‘massages’ to Epstein, which would be performed nude or 
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 4 of 14

5 
partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or 
more sex acts.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.   
22. 
“Between at least in or about 2002 and in or about 2005, Epstein abused numerous 
minor victims at the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited to engage in 
paid sex acts with him.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.     
23. 
Jeffrey Epstein received near daily massages from young females, often minors, 
who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than receive regular body massages, Epstein was 
predictably sexually abusing the young females in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130. 
24. 
Jeffrey Epstein, specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable 
and/or economically disadvantaged young females to sexually molest and abuse.   
ANASTASIA DOE 
25. 
Minor victim ANASTASIA DOE was subjected to the types of illegal sexual acts 
detailed in the Criminal Indictment filed against Jeffrey Epstein by the Southern District of New 
York and adopts herein the allegations above detailed in paragraphs 8-24.  
26. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed acts of sexual abuse against Plaintiff from 2003 through 
2008, beginning when she was 14 years old. 
27. 
In or about 2003, Plaintiff was recruited by another minor child to go to Jeffrey 
Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, New York to provide him with a “massage.”  
28. 
The minor child who recruited Plaintiff informed Plaintiff that she would be paid 
$300 to provide a massage to a rich man in Manhattan.  
29. 
Plaintiff was a minor female with no experience or training in massage.  
30. 
In 2003, Plaintiff’s friend brought Plaintiff to Jeffrey Epstein’s townhouse mansion 
located at 9 East 71st Street, NY to provide him with a massage.

Upon arrival to the mansion, the two minor children were escorted inside by an

32. 
Plaintiff’s friend entered the massage room with Plaintiff where they met Jeffrey 
Epstein.

Jeffrey Epstein lay down naked on the massage table and instructed Plaintiff and 
her friend to remove their clothes, and both complied.

Plaintiff’s friend began instructing Plaintiff how to provide Jeffrey Epstein a 
massage and Plaintiff began doing as told.

breasts, and vagina.

Plaintiff $300. 
40. 
After the first encounter, Plaintiff was asked for her telephone number which was 
kept by Jeffrey Epstein or one of his employees who worked at his NY mansion. 
41. 
Plaintiff was contacted regularly beginning in 2003 while she was 14 years old to 
schedule times for her to visit the mansion and engage in sexual acts with Jeffrey Epstein in his 
massage room.

42. 
Lesley Groff, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most trusted employees, would typically call 
Plaintiff to schedule a time for her to visit Jeffrey Epstein at the mansion. Other times, Plaintiff 
would be called by Jeffrey Epstein directly. 
43. 
Beginning in 2003 through 2006, Plaintiff visited Jeffrey Epstein at his mansion on 
average once per week. During each visit, Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual contact with Plaintiff, 
which often included touching her naked breasts and vagina and using sex toys on her vagina. 
44. 
On numerous occasions, Jeffrey Epstein would forcibly insert his finger or sex toy 
into Plaintiff’s vagina. 
45. 
On one occasion when Plaintiff was 15 years old, Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend 
entered the massage room while Plaintiff was in there. Jeffrey Epstein ordered his girlfriend to 
engage in oral sex with Plaintiff during that occasion, which she did by force and against Plaintiff’s 
will and consent.  
46. 
On another occasion, when Plaintiff was 16 years old, Jeffrey Epstein engaged in 
forcible sexual intercourse with Plaintiff, and paid her $400 instead of the normal $300 after that 
forcible sexual encounter.  
47. 
In addition to going to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion where Jeffrey Epstein violated the 
minor Plaintiff sexually, Jeffrey Epstein also encouraged Plaintiff to bring her high school friends 
to him for sexual purposes as well. 
48. 
Jeffrey Epstein told Plaintiff he would pay her $300 for each friend she brought 
him. 
49. 
Plaintiff did as she was instructed to do and brought Jeffrey Epstein other females 
as young as 14 years old.  Plaintiff was paid $300 for each she brought.
