CO-EXECUTORS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION TO 
DISMISS, OR ALTERNATIVELY, COMPEL PLAINTIFF TO APPEAR PRO SE  
 
 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, by and through their undersigned 
counsel, in their capacity as Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), and 
on behalf of the Estate and NES, LLC (“NES”), an entity administered in probate by the Co-
Executors as part of the Estate (collectively, “Defendants”), respectfully submit this reply in 
support of their supplemental motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, or alternatively, to compel 
Plaintiff Ghislaine Maxwell (“Maxwell”) to appear pro se.   
ARGUMENT 
 
Maxwell initiated the instant action over three and a half years ago, seeking contractual 
and common law indemnification of attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection with 
her criminal prosecution in the Southern District of New York.  Subsequently, Defendants moved

to dismiss pursuant to Virgin Islands Rule of Procedure 12(b)(6).  That motion has been fully 
briefed and pending before this Court since August 2022. 
 
The Court has held off ruling on Defendants’ motion because, in September 2022, 
Maxwell’s counsel withdrew, and the Court stayed the proceedings to allow Maxwell time to seek 
new representation.   By March 2023, Maxwell still had not secured new counsel, and the Court 
granted her an additional sixty days to do so.   
Having received no indication from Maxwell that she had retained new counsel or intended 
to proceed pro se, on September 19, 2023, Defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 41(b) for 
failure to prosecute, or alternatively, to compel Maxwell to appear pro se.  But on October 3, the 
Court received a filing from Maxwell—apparently dated May 16, 2023—in response to the Court’s 
March 2023 Order.1   In her filing, Maxwell seeks an additional one hundred-eighty days to secure 
new counsel and requests yet another stay during the pendency of the appeal of her criminal 
conviction.   
 
Maxwell’s perpetual delay in prosecuting her claims must end.  Maxwell’s filing sets forth 
no new grounds to support her request for more time to secure counsel.  Instead, she merely details 
the difficulties of obtaining counsel while incarcerated.  But Maxwell’s incarceration is the result 
of her crimes, and it does not excuse her from diligently prosecuting her claims in accordance with 
the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure.  Simon v. Herbert, 69 V.I. 963, 697 (V.I. 2018) 
(“Although we have traditionally given pro se litigants greater leeway where they have not 
followed the technical rules of pleading and procedure, self-representation is not a license excusing 
compliance with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.” (cleaned up)).   Indeed, 
Maxwell’s response to the Court’s March 2023 Order demonstrates that: (1) she was aware of the 
 
1 While the Court received Maxwell’s filing on October 3, Maxwell did not serve Defendants with a copy.  Defendants 
did not receive a copy until October 17, when the Court alerted Defendants of the filing.

Court’s direction to identify new counsel or appear pro se, and (2) she had ample time to find new 
counsel and still has not done so.  Given that the additional one hundred eighty days requested will 
expire shortly with no further word from Maxwell or appearances from counsel, Maxwell should 
not be permitted to delay this matter further.   
 
Moreover, as she indicates in her filing, if Maxwell is unable to obtain new counsel—
which appears to be the case thus far, as no appearance of counsel has been entered—she will be 
proceeding in this matter pro se.  Maxwell has indicated her willingness to proceed pro se, and 
that status does not justify any further delay of the Court’s consideration of Defendants’ Rule 
12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss.  Indeed, Defendants’ Motion has already been fully briefed by all 
parties when Maxwell was still represented by counsel.  Whether Maxwell is able to obtain counsel 
or not should have no effect on the Court’s consideration of the Motion.  Accordingly, Defendants 
respectfully submit that the Court should lift the stay and address Defendants’ pending Motion to 
Dismiss.   
 
Finally, this matter should not be further stayed during the pendency of Maxwell’s criminal 
appeal.  While Maxwell’s criminal conviction is one reason why her indemnification claims are 
barred, Defendants also set forth several other arguments in their Rule 12(b)(6) Motion that 
independently support dismissal of her claims, including that (1) NES’s operating agreement bars 
Maxwell’s claims and (2) the lawsuits for which Maxwell seeks indemnification are not related to 
her performance of legitimate, employment-related duties on behalf of Epstein or his affiliated 
entities.  Thus, the outcome of Maxwell’s criminal appeal does not preclude the Court from ruling 
on Defendants’ Motion.  As detailed in Defendants’ supplemental Motion, the Estate is prevented 
from completing probate and bringing the Estate to a close while this matter remains pending and

thus, any further delay is prejudicial.  Consequently, Maxwell’s request for a further stay should 
be denied.   
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Defendants’ supplemental Motion to 
Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute, or alternatively, should lift the stay, compel Maxwell’s pro se 
appearance, and rule on the Defendants’ pending Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim.
