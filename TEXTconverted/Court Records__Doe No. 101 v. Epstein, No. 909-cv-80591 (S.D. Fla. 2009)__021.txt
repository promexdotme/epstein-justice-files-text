Plaintiff,

JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
_____________ / 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO EXCEED PAGE LIMITATION 
FOR DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED 
COMPLAINT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE. FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned counsel, moves 
to exceed the page limitation of 20 pages imposed by Loe. Gen. Rule 7.1. C. 2. (S.D. 
Fla.), in his memorandum of law in support of his motion to dismiss directed to Plaintiff 
JANE DOE No. 101 's First Amended Complaint [DE 9], dated May 1, 2009. In support 
of his motion, Defendant states: 
1. Local Gen. Rule 7.1 C. 2. provides in part that absent prior permission of the 
court, no party shall file any legal memorandum exceeding 20 pages in length. 
Defendant is in the process of preparing his motion to dismiss and alternative motion for 
more definite statement, and his supporting memorandum of law directed to Plaintiff's 
First Amended Complaint. (Defendant's response to the First Amended Compalint is 
due May 26, 2009). The legal memorandum will exceed the 20 page limitation. It is 
clear based on the issues raised in Plaintiff's complaint that in excess of 20 pages is 
required to fully and adequately discuss the issues raised in moving to dismiss Plaintiff's 
action.

2. The issues being addressed pertain to the interpretation and application of 18 
U.S.C. §2255. Some of these issues include but are not limited to constitutional law 
issues and what version of 18 U.S.C.A. §2255 applies to this action, and the meaning of 
§2255 with respect to the cause of action created and the presumptive minimum 
damages amount imposed. (It is Defendant's position that the 2006 amended version 
does NOT apply to this action; rather, it is the statute in effect during the time of the 
alleged conduct that apply). 
3. A length exceeding 20 pages is required so that Defendant may fully address the 
issues raised in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and in seeking dismissal thereof. 
Under the constitutional guarantees of due process, including a fair and full opportunity 
to be heard, and in the interests of justice so that the Court may render a fully informed 
decision on the issues, Defendant is entitled to an order granting his motion to exceed 
the page limitation. 
(Defendant anticipates that the legal memorandum will be 
approximately 30-35 pages in length.) 
4. As certified below, Plaintiff's counsel agreed to the request to exceed 20 pages. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court grant Defendant's 
motion, and enter an order allowing Defendant's legal memorandum in support of 
dismissal of Plaintiff's action to be in excess of 20 pages.
