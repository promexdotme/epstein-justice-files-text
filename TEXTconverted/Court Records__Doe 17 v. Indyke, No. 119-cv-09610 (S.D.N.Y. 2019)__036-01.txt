claims against Defendants, alleges and states as follows: 
1.

age of 18.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
23. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Epstein was an adult male over 45 
years old.  Epstein was a tremendously wealthy individual, widely recognized as a billionaire, 
who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual crimes in 
violation of federal and state laws and who employed or conspired with other individuals and 
corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes or torts or who facilitated or enabled 
those acts to occur. 
24. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his direction, to the victims 
procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance, carry out, and conceal his 
crimes and torts. 
25. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, as well as a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he regularly 
traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-31H with tail number 
N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-1159B with tail number N909JE). 
26. 
Epstein also inhabited and frequently travelled between numerous properties and 
homes, each of which he admitted to being owned or controlled by him, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York  10021 valued conservatively by 
Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00 (but valued by the US Attorney’s office for this

District at $77,000,000); a ranch located at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056 
valued conservatively by  Epstein’s own admission at $17,246,208.00; a home located at 358 El 
Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida  33480 valued conservatively by Epstein’s own admission at 
$12,380,209.00; an apartment located at 22 Avenue Foch, Paris, France 75116 valued 
conservatively by Epstein’s own admission at $8,672,820.00; an Island located at Great St. 
James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C); and an Island Little St. James Island 
No. 6B USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C).  See Jeffrey Epstein “Asset Summary – June 30, 
2019” filed in Case No. 1:19-cr-00490-RMB on July 15, 2019 attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
27. 
Epstein controlled or was affiliated with the corporation or business entities that 
owned, managed, or maintained each of the real properties listed in the preceding paragraph and 
enumerated in Exhibit A. 
28. 
The allegations herein concern Epstein’s tortious conduct committed against 
Plaintiff while at the residences owned by Defendant Nine East in New York, Defendant Laurel 
in Florida, Defendant Cypress in New Mexico and Defendants LSJE and Nautilus in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.  Many such acts were facilitated by Defendant NES or Defendant HBRK or 
Defendant JEGE. 
29. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females, as young as 14 
years old, and acted on that sexual preference for decades. 
30. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor children, and 
also took pleasure corrupting vulnerable and innocent young females, including minor children, 
into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 6 of 34

Page 7 of 34 
 
31. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees and 
associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the purpose of 
harming young females through sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking. 
32. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence that he 
obtained pleasure from corrupting and inducing vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
33. 
Epstein’s illegal sexual activities were investigated by law enforcement on at least 
two occasions, once in 2005-2008 by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, and more recently by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
34. 
On July 2, 2019 the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a sealed Two Count Indictment including One Count of Sex Trafficking 
Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking for violations of 18 U.S.C. §1591, in part due to 
Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 East 71st 
Street. 
35. 
In addition to the allegations in the criminal indictment referenced above, Epstein 
also utilized a similar, if not the same; scheme many years before the time period that was 
charged and many years after as well as in additional locations nationally and internationally. 
36. 
Corporate Defendants enabled Epstein to receive daily massages from young 
females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than receive regular body 
massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing young females, including Plaintiff, in 
violation of New York Penal Law §130.

Page 8 of 34 
 
37. 
Additionally, employees of the various Corporate Defendants performed actions 
or failed to perform actions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in danger of being 
sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his sexually abusive acts. 
38. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females, or directed employees of 
his related companies, to recruit young females   In order to grow the enterprise and satisfy his 
insatiable sexual desire, Epstein and those working at his direction enabled victims themselves to 
elevate their status within the enterprise to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an elevation 
only made possible through the assistance of Defendants. 
39. 
Recruiters were taught by Epstein or by employees of Corporate Defendants to 
inform targeted young female victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, 
resources, and influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance 
their education, careers, and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body 
massages in order to avail herself of his nearly unlimited assistance and influence. 
40. 
Epstein and Corporate Defendants and their many employees fulfilled Epstein’s 
compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, psychological, 
financial, and related vulnerabilities.  Epstein and Defendants’ tactics included promising the 
victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission into educational 
institutions, education tuition, professional licensure, protection, healthcare and other things of 
value. 
41. 
Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females dated back to at 
least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased substantially with the necessary 
assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ employees.

Page 9 of 34 
 
42. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, and with 
help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, recruited or procured 
dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual 
gratification. 
43. 
Epstein, and employees of certain Corporate Defendants, including at least 
Defendant HBRK, specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or 
economically disadvantaged young females to sexually molest and abuse. 
44. 
Additionally, Epstein and Corporate Defendants, through employees, informed 
young females, including Plaintiff that Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and had the power 
and ability to impact the life of any young female recruited or obtained to provide a massage. 
45. 
Each of the Corporate Defendants committed acts of negligence that allowed for 
Epstein to commit acts in violation of New York Penal Law §130. 
46. 
Each of the Defendants committed acts against Plaintiff in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§1591 – §1595. 
JANE DOE 17 
47. 
Consistent with Epstein’s foregoing plan, scheme/enterprise, the Plaintiff was 
recruited to provide Epstein with massages for monetary compensation.  These massages 
provided to Epstein by Plaintiff progressed to instances of inappropriate sexual contact with the 
Plaintiff by Epstein in touching, inappropriate vaginal penetration, and outright rape.  Plaintiff 
was sexually assaulted, violated, and otherwise degraded, injured, victimized, and subjected to 
outrageous, reckless abuse and insult. 
48. 
In this regard, the Defendants willingly participated, contributed, cooperated, and 
assisted the inappropriate and illegal scheme by facilitating such scheme by and through the 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 9 of 34
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 36-1     Filed 12/23/19     Page 10 of 37

Page 10 of 34 
 
employees of the Corporate Defendants such that the Corporate Defendants were acting jointly 
and in concert with the illegal scheme with the goal designed to produce corrupt sexual 
gratification for Epstein and degradation for the targets and victims of the corrupt scheme set in 
motion with the active involvement of the Corporate Defendants and their employees.   
49. 
Epstein’s abuse of the Plaintiff was not incidental or fleeting but rather was born 
out of a pathological desire to achieve, corrupt and deviate sexual gratification through the 
subjugation and abuse of Epstein’s targeted victims.  The actions on behalf of the Corporate 
Defendants by and through its employees enhanced, facilitated, and promoted the deviate sexual 
acts of Epstein and contributed a corrupting influence which ensnared unsuspecting women and 
girls in its reach. 
50. 
Epstein, by acting singularly and in concert with the Corporate Defendants, 
devised a sophisticated plan and a modus operandi which subtly and pervasively over time 
connived to influence the victims and subjects of the corrupt and deviant sexual scheme to 
influence the will to resist the temptations both actual and promised on behalf of the scheme and 
thereby manipulate the victims into acceptance of the scheme as being one that was acceptable 
and appropriate by virtue of communications and representations made on behalf of Epstein by 
the Corporate Defendants and in fact Epstein himself.  The scheme utilized a gradual wearing 
down of the victim’s will to resist and did so by virtue of offering positive and negative rewards 
for compliance with the scheme’s overall deviant methodology and goals.  
51. 
Once Epstein and the Corporate Defendants’ victims were entrapped and the 
scheme’s methodologies enabled, Epstein and the corporate defendants through its employees 
utilized techniques to further inhibit, indoctrinate, and threaten Epstein’s victims such that 
compliance with the deviant scheme’s goals could be further obtained.

Page 11 of 34 
 
52. 
The deviant scheme was perpetuated over years by the actions of Epstein and the 
Corporate Defendants such that victims were caught up in the scheme, pressure, threats, and 
indoctrination techniques utilized to bring the victims to heel. 
53. 
For victims young, vulnerable, and struggling financially, the scheme’s 
methodology was particularly effective. 
54. 
As part and parcel of the scheme’s goals, Epstein’s colleagues and acquaintances 
were involved in the scheme and benefited from the scheme by virtue of receiving sexual favors 
and inappropriate, illegal, and otherwise commercial sexual services provided by Epstein’s 
victims such that the corrupt intent of this scheme involved males other than Epstein himself. 
As a direct and proximate result of the methodology of the deviant scheme and the goals of 
sexual exploitation of the women recruited and victimized, Plaintiff was subject to unwanted 
touching of her breasts and genitals, other sensitive areas of her body, required to perform acts 
of a sexual nature against her will and subjected to genital penetration and otherwise sexually 
degraded, abused, insulted, coerced, and injured, experience resulting in confusion, emotional 
distress, mental pain and suffering, shame, humiliation, loss of the enjoyment of life, 
inconvenience, and other injuries to body, mind and soul.  
55. 
Epstein and the Corporate Defendants by and through their employees and agents 
substantially contributed to proximately cause injury to the Plaintiff as aforementioned.   
56. 
Over a course of years, Epstein and the Corporate Defendants, by and through its 
employees and agents, facilitated the multiple rapes conducted on the Plaintiff in addition to 
other deviant sexual acts against her will.  Furthermore, the plaintiff’s virginity was forcefully 
taken from her against her will.

57. 
This fraudulent scheme of Epstein’s constituted acts of coercion from beginning 
to end, from 2001 through mid-2006, inasmuch as the scheme was designed to and in fact, 
caused Plaintiff to believe that her failure to perform any sex act required by Epstein would 
result in serious financial, reputational, physical and emotional harm to her.

COUNT III 
 
(CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DARREN K. INDYKE AND RICHARD D. KAHN AS 
JOINT PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. 
EPSTEIN PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 1595) 
  
64. 
Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 57 above.  
65. 
Epstein, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States, in interstate and foreign commerce, and/or affecting interstate and foreign commerce, 
knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, 
solicited, threatened, forced, or coerced Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts.    
66. 
Such actions were undertaken knowing that his use of force, threats of force, 
fraud, coercion, and/or combinations of such means would be used, and were in fact, used, in 
order to cause Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts.  In doing so, Epstein violated 18 
U.S.C. §1591.    
67. 
Furthermore, Epstein attempted to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591.  In so doing, violated 
18 U.S.C. § 1594(a).
