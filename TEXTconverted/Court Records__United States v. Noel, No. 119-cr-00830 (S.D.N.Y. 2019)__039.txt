Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830 
 
 
 
 
Adjournment Request 
 
Dear Hon. Judge Torres: 
 
As you are aware, our firm represents Defendant, Michael Thomas, in the above-
captioned matter. We are seeking an application for an adjournment of the January 4, 2021 trial 
date. Due to COVID-19 and my health concerns, combined with the fact that I need more time to 
complete my investigation, I am requesting that the Court adjourns the trial date to sometime in 
mid spring, preferably on or about May 3, 2021. 
 
Respectfully yours, 
/s/ Montell Figgins
