MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Work product and 
common interest. 
A. 
I think I can answer that question. 
Based 
7 
on material that was produced in discovery, which 
8 
would not be subject to privilege, there seems to be 
9 
evidence that she did fly on the airplane with 
10 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
11 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
12 
Q. 
Was she lying when she says that she was 
13 
flown on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane across state 
14 
lines at a time when she was under the age of 18?

A. 
I have no idea. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Same objection. 
Work product and attorney-client and common 
interest. 
A. 
I have no idea. 
But, again --
I just have 
20 
no idea. 
21 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
22 
Q. 
Is there any nonprivileged information 
23 
that you could review that would give you an idea to 
24 
answer that question or that would give you the 
25 
answer to that question?

What we have here is only the fraction of

Can you help us get the flight logs from Larry

outside of the record on that.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
11 
12 
Q. 
A. 
Okay. 
I know that Sigrid Mccawley said that she

25 
MS. McCAWLEY: 
I am going to object to the 
extent that you are trying to reveal 
conversations that were part of a settlement 
discussion which the judge has already sealed 
the record on and there is a pending motion for 
sanctions. 
And if you're going to start 
revealing that information, we're going 
directly to the Judge Lynch. 
A. 
I am going to start revealing 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
No, I'm going to 
stop you 
THE WITNESS: 
Let me tell you why.

Because I didn't get that from Sigrid or from 
David Boise. 
I got it from Leslie Wexner's 
lawyer in a totally nonprivileged 
communication. 
510 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Let me stop you. 
I don't believe it's responsive to the question 
that's pending, so let's move forward. 
8 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
9 
Q. 
My question was, was she lying -- was 
10 
Virginia Roberts lying when she says Jeffrey Epstein 
11 
and Ghislaine Maxwell made her dress up in outfits 
12 
for them? 
13 
A. 
I can only say that that allegation has 
14 
been made regarding Leslie Wexner as well. 
15 
16 
17 
Q. 
A. 
It has nothing to do with my question. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
Move to strike. 
Leslie Wexner's lawyer regards that as a 
18 
full statement and, therefore, I can only assume 
19 
that it's a false statement when made about someone 
20 
else. 
I think that's relevant. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
So with respect 
to the --
MR. EDWARDS: 
I'm moving to strike the 
nonresponsive portion of that answer.

1 
A. 
My information is that Virginia Roberts 
2 
was lying when she said that she saw Bill Clinton on 
3 
Jeffrey Epstein's island. 
That's all I can comment 
4 
about with that. 
And she's lying about that. 
And 
5 
she's lying about how Bill Clinton got to the 
6 
island.

MR. EDWARDS: 
I move to strike the 
Nonresponsive portion of the answer.

No, it's 
relevant to what you asked. 
Move forward. 
I'm 
11 
not going to strike it.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
13 
Q. 
I'm going to go back to the question until 
14 
I get an answer, though. 
15 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Go ahead. 
16 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
17 
Q. 
That is, when Virginia Roberts said that 
18 
during the relevant time period, which we defined as 
19 
1999 through 2002 --
20 
A. 
Let's be clear. 
Around August of both of 
21 
those years, right? 
22 
23 
2002. 
24 
25 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
I think August of 
1 99 through October of 
September, I think it is. 
Okay. 
Was she lying -- was Virginia

Roberts lying when she said Jeffrey Epstein 
2 
socialized with Bill Clinton during that time 
3 
period? 
4 
5 
A. 
I don't know. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
6 
instruction. 
7 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
513 
8 
Q. 
And you have no nonprivileged information 
9 
that would provide you the answer to that? 
10 
A. 
I have nonprivileged information that 
11 
provides me that they socialized together at some 
12 
point. 
I don't know whether it was within that 
13 
timeframe at all. 
I know they went to Africa 
14 
together on a mission of goodwill, but I don't know 
15 
the date of that. 
So I can't tell you whether it 
16 
was in the period or outside the period. 
You may 
17 
know that; I don't. 
18 
Q. 
Well, if Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton 
19 
associated, but only at some time period either 
20 
before or after the relevant time period, it would 
21 
immediately disprove her statement that Bill Clinton 
22 
and Jeffrey Epstein socialized during that time 
23 
period? 
24 
25 
A. 
Q. 
I don't understand that question. 
No?

rephrase the question, that would be helpful. 
MR. EDWARDS:

BY MR. EDWARDS:

Q. 
If you -- do you know from nonprivileged 
7 
information whether Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton 
8 
ever socialized?

SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Again, under 
nonprivileged. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Under nonprivileged 
information. 
MR. SCOTT: 
Do you have any nonprivileged 
information about that? 
A. 
I remember having dinner at the home of 
21 
Caroline Kennedy and Ed Schlossberg with President 
22 
Clinton, and he basically asked me how Jeffrey was 
23 
doing, and led me to believe that he had some 
24 
relationship with Jeffrey. 
I don't remember whether 
25 
that dinner -- when that dinner was. 
I can probably

Was he still President at the time that

conversation was taking place?

I don't remember. 
Have you ever been, yourself, together 
7 
with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton?

Have you ever talked to Jeffrey Epstein 
10 
about Bill Clinton?

MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Same objection, 
same instruction. 
A. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Nonprivileged. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Yeah, nonprivileged. 
It's hard to sort out the privileged and 
16 
the nonprivileged.

19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
So based upon 
the objection, I would ask that you -- unless 
it's obvious, then no, until we sort that out. 
A. 
I shouldn't answer that probably. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
I'm going to 
grant his objection at this point, again, as a 
continuum because I want to make sure that we 
preserve this issue for later on.

2 
Q. 
In a previous -- previously in this 
3 
deposition, you indicated your representation of 
4 
Jeffrey Epstein on this subject matter began in 
5 
2005, right? 
6 
A. 
It began, I think I said, when the first 
7 
allegations were. 
I don't have an exact date in 
8 
mind. 
9 
Q. 
The relevant time period for Virginia 
10 
Roberts, as we've defined, is 1999 through 2002. 
11 
A. 
That's correct, yes. 
12 
Q. 
So I'm asking if you know from Jeffrey 
13 
Epstein, in a time period prior to your

representation, whether he was socializing with Bill

his relationship with Bill Clinton?

BY MR. EDWARDS:

Prior to 2005, obviously. 
That they knew each other and that they

were doing some charitable work together.

And now 
12 
I'm drilling it. 
13

Okay. 
Did you understand -- did Bill

Clinton travel with Jeffrey Epstein?

19 
A. 
My understanding from newspaper 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
My understanding from newspaper accounts 
20 
is that they went to Africa together with some other 
21 
famous people, and I think maybe went to Asia 
22 
together as well. 
So the answer is yes, I am aware 
23 
through nonprivileged sources that they traveled 
24 
together, yes.

SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
No, rephrase the

question, the previous question about who the 
12 
young lady is next to Prince Andrew. 
13 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
14 
Q. 
Sure. 
Do you know who this lady is in the 
15 
middle of this photograph? 
16 
A. 
On the basis of newspaper accounts, it is 
17 
reported that she is Virginia Roberts. 
I wouldn't 
18 
be able -- if you had shown me that picture a year 
19 
and 16 days ago, I would not have been able to tell 
20 
you that that's Virginia Roberts because I didn't 
21 
know who she was. 
22 
Q. 
And who is the other person that's in this 
23 
photograph? 
24 
25 
A. 
Q. 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 
And that's somebody else that you know,

correct? 
2 
3 
A. 
Q. 
4 
right? 
5 
I do. 
And you know her through Jeffrey Epstein, 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
6 
7 
instruction. 
A. 
I wrote an article about her father's 
8 
death years ago, and I don't remember if I met her 
9 
independently. 
I do remember meeting her through 
10 
her --
I remember that the Lady Rothschild asked me 
11 
to meet Jeffrey Epstein, and when Jeffrey Epstein 
12 
came to meet me, he was with Ghislaine Maxwell. 
13 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
14 
15 
Q. 
A. 
And when was that? 
The first time I Jeffrey Epstein, which 
16 
would have been in the summer of Leslie Wexner's 
17 
59th birthday. 
That's all I can tell you is the 
18 
summer of his 59th birthday because I then flew with 
19 
Jeffrey Epstein to Leslie Wexner's 59th birthday. 
I 
20 
was presented to Leslie Wexner. 
Leslie would like 
21 
to get as birthday gifts interesting people that his 
22 
friends had met during the year, and so I was 
23 
Jeffrey Epstein's intellectual gift to Leslie 
24 
Wexner. 
And it was that year that I met Jeffrey 
25 
Epstein. 
That's the best I can date it.

Okay. 
And Ghislaine Maxwell, you are

I'm asking about your conversations with

Have you

MR. INDYKE:

SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
What's the

of the objection is -- and what was the 
question? 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Has Mr. Dershowitz spoken 
9 
with Ghislaine Maxwell since the allegations 
10 
since this defamation suit came about as well 
524 
11 
as the defamation suit with Ghislaine Maxwell. 
12 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
13 
Q. 
Let me ask it cleaner. 
Have you spoken 
14 
with Ghislaine Maxwell since January 2015? 
15 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
16 
instruction. 
17 
BY MR. EDWARDS:

Q. 
So that I'm clear, there is a joint 
19 
defense of the allegations regarding Ghislaine 
20 
Maxwell that's New York litigation and this 
21 
defamation case? 
22 
23 
24

MR. INDYKE: 
There's a common interest 
agreement in effect with respect to the 
New York case and a common interest agreement 
with respect to this case.

Was Virginia Roberts lying when she

Who negotiated the agreement

Mccawley, if any of the individuals on the

That needs to be clarified. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Correct. 
Correct. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
The answer is 
correct? 
526 
MR. INDYKE: 
With respect to Mr. Epstein, 
I can tell you there's a common interest 
agreement with respect to this matter and a 
common interest agreement with respect to the 
Ghislaine Maxwell suit in New York. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Is 
Mr. Dershowitz party to that? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Mr. Dershowitz is party to a 
common interest agreement with Jeffrey in this 
case.

SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
With respect to 
that question, you can answer. 
A. 
My understanding is that I am still 
13 
Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer. 
Jeffrey Epstein, I 
14 
understand, has a common interest or joint defense

agreement with Ghislaine Maxwell, so I have -- my

understanding is that I am bound by a common

agreement.

BY MR. EDWARDS:

Q. 
Is this the same common interest agreement 
20 
that we were talking about from 2005, or is this a 
21 
separate common interest agreement that has been 
22 
signed as a consequence of the lawsuits that have 
23 
been filed since January 2015?

If this is a new question, 
I'll assert the same objection and the same

instruction. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
And I'm going to 
overrule the objection. 
And you can answer

A. 
My understanding is that it's a

combination; that is, it reflects the previous

agreement and that there is a new agreement that 
8 
supplemented the previous agreement.

BY MR. EDWARDS:

When you say it's your understanding, is

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
2 
Q. 
The photograph is printed in March of 
3 
2001, which is when she's 17, which just means that 
4 
the photograph was taken sometime before that date. 
5 
So she was at least as young as 17 is the best that 
6 
I can tell you. 
7 
A. 
Under the age of consent, that would be an 
8 
act of prostitution. 
If she was paid $15,000 to 
9 
have sex with Prince Andrew at the age of 17 in 
10 
England, she would be guilty of prostitution.
