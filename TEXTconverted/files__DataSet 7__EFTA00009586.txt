acquaintances, 
and 
, and you met them at 
a beach resort, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And you said that they made a 
proposition to you. What was that exactly? 
A 
had asked me if I wanted to make 
money and she was working for this guy, Epstein, 
in Palm Beach. So I told her I was interested and 
she further went into detail about massaging him, 
that you would have to take off articles of 
clothing and there would be touching and fondling 
involved. 
Q

previously worked for Epstein or was currently 
working for Epstein? 
A 
Yes, that's right. 
Q 
So they explained this proposal to you 
and you said that you would be interested? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
What happened next? 
A 
Within a couple of days to a week I 
picked them up and I went to his house to work for 
him and I was introduced to 
, who is his 
assistant. She took me upstairs to Epstein's 
bedroom and that's where the massage took place. 
I was naked and he tried fondling me and 
I wouldn't have it, so after the massage he gave 
me another proposition to bring girls to the house 
and for every girl that I brought I would make 
$200. 
Q 
All right. We'll go back over that a 
little more slowly. 
I know this is a lot of 
information. So let's go back to the proposition 
that 
and 
made to you. 
Did they say you would be paid for 
massaging Mr. Epstein? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And how much would you be paid?

Q 
Now you said that they had told you that 
you might have to take your clothing off? 
A 
They told me that I was expected to take 
my clothing off and that there would be fondling. 
Q 
Okay. And what -- did they explain 
what fondling meant? 
A 
Just that he'd be touching me. 
Q 
Okay.

you went to Mr. Epstein's home?

Q 
What was in the bedroom? 
A 
It was a bedroom that had a door that 
led to then I want to say a bigger more than just 
a bathroom. It was a bigger room with like a 
pretty large size walk-in closet, a shower, a 
steam shower, and then two sinks. on the right, and 
in the middle laid the massage table, and then to 
the left there was two couches.

Q 
Okay. And nothing else? 
A 
Nothing else. 
Q 
And what did he do? 
A 
He laid on the table and that's when the 
massage began and later on he -- when he got in, I 
took off my clothes and I was just wearing my 
bottoms, and he later tried to touch me and he 
grabbed my butt, and that's when. I had a problem. 
I told him that I didn't feel comfortable. 
So later he took the towel off and he 
was laying on his back and he 
asking me to 
and then after that everything 
was done.

Okay. So when Mr. Epstein 
then the massage or whatever was over?

A 
I went back into the kitchen and he 
pulled 
and 
aside and then we just left. 
Of course, I got paid. 
Q 
Okay. And tell us where you got paid, 
who paid you, and how much you received? 
A 
Epstein paid me. 
I received 200, but I 
cannot recall if it was upstairs that he paid me 
or if he waited until I got back downstairs. 
Q 
Okay. And when he paid you the $200,
was it in small bills, large bills? 
A 
Big bills, 100s. 
Q 
Okay. So two 100 dollar bills. 
And you 
said that he pulled 
and 
aside. Do you 
know what that was about? 
A 
He would never pay them in front of me. 
He always was funny about that. So I'm sure it 
was just paying them for bringing me. 
Q 
Okay. 
And you mentioned that you told 
Mr. Epstein that you were uncomfortable with him 
touching you? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And what bec.ame of that? 
A 
Later on before I left he had addressed 
me to not massage him anymore, but asked me if I

could bring girls over, and for every girl that I 
brought to the table he would pay me $200.

him touching you, so you weren't going to do any

No.

He wanted you to find other girls?

interested.

subject. They had no problem with it. 
Q 
Okay. So when you found a girl that you 
thought would be interested, what exactly would 
you tell her? 
A 
I asked them if they were interested in 
making extra money and that I knew an older 
wealthier man in Palm Beach who liked to have 
massages and they would get paid $200. 
The more they did, the more they make, 
and I would explain to them in detail what was 
expected of them when they showed up at the house 
and I also told them that if they are under age 
just lie about it and tell him that you are 18 
Q 
Let's talk first about what you said 
that you tell them what was expected of them. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
First of all, why did you tell them 
that?

Because that's what I was told 
O 
By whom? 
A 
and 
Q 
Okay. And did Jeffrey Epstein ever 
address you about don't bring girls over here if 
they don't know what's going to happen?

2 
know that when they got there they would be 
3 
undressing? 
4 
A 
They would be undressing. There would

girl over unless they knew what was expected.

Partially to fully naked and there would 
be touching and fondling.

took to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
Seven, between seven to ten.

to this rule about the girls had to know what was 
expected, did Mr. Epstein have any other rules in 
terms of what the girls looked like or what he 
liked? 
A 
No.

of too old.

with III? 
A 
He had made a comment just about 
had asked -- he had asked me for someone to come 
over and work and when I suggested III, he kind of 
nodded, not really interested. He told me to find 
somebody else. So I assumed that meant he really 
didn't care for her.

jury what those two ways are? 
A 
The more you did is the more you make. 
Basically, the more clothes that come off, the 
more you let him touch you, the more you just let 
him have his way with you is the more that you 
would make, otherwise, you would be demoted down 
to bringing girls over and just making money that 
way. 
Q 
And that's what you were doing? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
Was bringing girls? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
If you could explain to the grand jury 
how you would go about making an appointment for a 
girl to come and give a massage? 
A 
His assistant there would call me either 
before they got into town or while he was in town 
and either she would ask me for a particular girl, 
preferably one that he favored, or if I couldn't 
get a hold of that girl just bring somebody over 
to work. 
I would call the girl. She would okay 
it. 
I would call 
back, confirm it, set an 
appointment, and then the next couple of days we'd 
go.

just go upstairs. 
I would show her where the

they liked the best, for instance,

a while me and 
stopped contact with each 
other and Jeffrey just went strictly through her.

weekend.

We never discussed age. He never made a 
comment about age except for 
that one time 
about her being too old. He never told me to go 
find under aged girls, but at the same time never 
said make sure they are over 18. It was never 
discussed. 
Q 
Okay. All right. 
I'm going to ask you to 
step outside for a minute and I will find out

follow-up questions. The first one is something 
that I think you spoke about earlier, but who 
first asked you to find other girls? 
A 
Who first asked me to first other girls? 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
That would be Epstein. 
Q 
Okay. So Jeffrey asked you himself, 
Jeffrey Epstein himself asked you? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay. And then the other question was: 
Are you currently in contact with anyone who works 
for Mr. Epstein or himself? 
A 
I don't talk to any of the females that 
I once brought over there. I haven't been in 
contact with Epstein for years. He tried 
contacting me a few times. 
I haven't contacted him back. I refuse

to talk to him. 
I refuse to talk to any of the 
girls that were involved. However, I did live 
with one of the girls in Orlando for a couple 
months to a year. 
I haven't spoken to her in over 
a year either. 
Q 
Okay. So after 
and just so the grand 
jury has a sense here, we are talking about the 
2004 to 2005 period is when you were bringing 
girls over? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
So since then 
A 
I don't -- to be honest with you, I 
think it was more 2003, 2004. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
My junior senior year. 
Q 
Okay. But anyhow it .was a couple of 
years ago? 
A 
Several years ago. 
Q 
Okay. 
Is there any follow up 
on either of those points? Yes, 
A GRAND JUROR: Was it Jeffrey Epstein 
himself trying to contact you or 
THE WITNESS: I don't know if it wasliim 
directly. 
I know that his number showed up

gill. was there, I'm assuming that she is the 
one that has been trying to contact me in the 
past years. Epstein never talked directly to 
me on the phone.

Any other follow up? 
Okay. Thank you, IIIIII
