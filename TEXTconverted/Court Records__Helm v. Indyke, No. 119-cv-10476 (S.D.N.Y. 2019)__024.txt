Re: 
Teresa Helm v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the 
executors of The Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10476 (PGG) (DCF)
Dear Judge Gardephe: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, in the referenced action.  We write with Plaintiff’s consent to request a three 
day extension of the deadline for Defendants’ reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss 
Plaintiff’s Complaint, from March 17, 2020 to March 20, 2020.  
We requested this extension because of various difficulties arising from the current COVID-19 
crisis.  This is the second request for an extension of this deadline.  The prior request, which 
Your Honor granted, was for a one business day adjustment to the entire briefing schedule.  
The requested extension will not affect any other scheduled dates. 
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz
