Re:

Dear Judge Nathan: 
We represent Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, named herein as “joint personal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein,” 
Nine East 71 Street, Corp., Financial Trust Company, Inc., and NES, LLC, (together, 
“Defendants”), in the referenced action.  We write to clarify the record in response to Plaintiff’s 
counsel’s October 16, 2019 letter (ECF # 24) attaching a copy of an Order that the Hon. P. 
Kevin Castel issued in Katlyn Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, et al., 1:19-cv-0777.  Specifically, Judge 
Castel issued the aforementioned Order ex parte, before our clients timely appeared in Katlyn 
Doe.  
We also write to respectfully request that the Court approve counsel for the parties’ agreement 
that Defendants have through November 15, 2019 to respond to Plaintiff’s Motion to Proceed 
Anonymously (ECF #4).  This is the first request regarding this deadline.    
Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz
