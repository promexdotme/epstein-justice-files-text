on the preparation of a Pretrial Stipulation in accordance with Local Rule 16.1E.  
A Pretrial Stipulation lacking substance will not be accepted.  Any party causing a unilateral
pretrial stipulation to be filed will be required to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. 
Each attorney and each self-represented party is charged with the duty of complying with this Order. 
A motion for continuance shall not stay the requirement for the filing of the Pretrial Stipulation and,
unless an emergency situation arises, or good cause is shown, a motion for continuance will not be
considered unless it is filed at least twenty (20) days prior to the calendar call.  Failure to comply
with the time schedule may result in dismissal or other sanctions.
Consent Jurisdiction
5.  In light of the benefits offered by a trial before a magistrate judge, e.g., trial on a date
certain as opposed to placement on a trial calendar, the parties are urged to consider this option. 
Therefore, within twenty (20) days of the entry of this order each attorney is ordered to meet with
his or her client and discuss this option.  Plaintiff’s counsel shall monitor this process.  If there is
not unanimity in favor of magistrate jurisdiction, plaintiff’s counsel need do nothing further.  If,
however, there is unanimity in favor of magistrate jurisdiction, plaintiff’s counsel shall execute the
form (which can be retrieved from www.flsd.uscourts.gov) entitled “Notice of Right to Consent to
Disposition of a Civil Case by a United States Magistrate Judge,” and forward the original, executed
form to defendants’ counsel.  After completion by all defendants or their counsel, the original form
should be forwarded to the Clerk of the Court, West Palm Beach Division.
Mediation
6.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 and Local Rule 16.2, this case is referred
to mediation, to the extent not excluded by Local Rule 16.2.C, as follows:
a.  The mediation shall be completed sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled calendar

call;
b.  The parties shall, within sixty (60) days hereof, agree upon a mediator and advise
the Clerk’s office of their choice, failing which the Clerk will designate a mediator from the list of
certified mediators on a blind random basis;
c.  Plaintiff’s counsel shall be responsible for coordinating the mediation conference
date and location agreeable to the mediator and all counsel of record;
d.  Within five (5) days following the mediation conference, the mediator shall file a
Mediation Report indicating who attended the mediation and the result thereof.
Discovery Referred to Magistrate Judge
7.  In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636 and the Magistrate Rules of the Local Rules of the
Southern District of Florida, the above-captioned cause is referred to United States Magistrate Judge
Linnea R. Johnson for appropriate disposition of all pretrial discovery motions, and all motions that
relate directly to these motions, such as motions for extension of time, motions for reconsideration,
motions for sanctions, and motions for mental or physical examinations. This Order does not refer
any motion which requests a continuance or extension of the trial or pretrial scheduling dates. 
Exhibits
8.  Exhibits must be pre-marked and exchanged prior to execution of the Pretrial Stipulation. 
Each exhibit should be marked with a sticker identifying the case number, exhibit number, and party
offering the exhibit.
Jury Instructions and Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
9.  In cases tried before a jury, each party shall submit joint, stipulated proposed jury
instructions and a joint, stipulated proposed verdict form in hard copy form and e-mailed in Word or
Wordperfect format to marra@flsd.uscourts.gov.  All requested instructions shall be typed on a

3790 and to submit an appropriate Stipulation for Order of Dismissal, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
41(a)(1).  Such an Order must be filed within ten (10) days of notification to the Court, or prior to
the Calendar Call, whichever occurs first.  Cases are not removed from the trial calendar unless a
stipulation for dismissal is filed with the Court.
