SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
C.L., 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
------------
JUN 1 4 2010 
STEVEN M. LARIMORE 
CLERK U.S. DIST. CT. 
S.D. OF FLA. -W.P.8. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion to 
Quash and Motion for Attorneys' Fees, With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN") by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion 
to Quash and Motion for Attorneys' fees and Costs, With Incorporated Memorandum Of 
Law. In support, Defendant states as follows: 
1. As this Court is well aware, these cases have been consolidated for discovery. 
However, on April 1, 2010, Plaintiffs counsel, Spencer Kuvin, filed C.L. v. Epstein, 
Case No. 10-80447-cv-Marra/Johnson, and that case has not been consolidated with the 
other related cases for purposes of discovery. 
2. On April 20, 2010, Mr. Kuvin served Maritza Milagros Vasquez with a subpoena 
for deposition, which is set to occur tomorrow. See Exhibit "A". However, this Notice 
and subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed as Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his 
client, has failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (d). That rule states, in pertinent part, 
that: "[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred 
as required by Rule 26(f) .... " Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has not complied with 
Rule 26(f) and, therefore, the subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed and a 
Protective Order should be entered pursuant to Rule 26( c) forbidding the deposition from 
1 

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 2 of 9
occurring for non-compliance with the applicable rules. In Varo, Inc. v. Litton Systems, 
Inc., 129 F.R.D. 139, 141 (N.D. TX 1989), the court held that one cannot be compelled to 
comply with a withdrawn subpoena. Id. Likewise, the court here cannot compel Maritza 
Milagros Vasquez to attend any deposition when the subpoena itself is invalid, especially 
when it will require those involved in these matters to incur substantial attorneys' fees. 
3. Next, Mr. Brad Edwards, counsel for Jane Doe, cross-noticed Maritza Milagros 
Vasquez's deposition in Jane Doe (#08-80893 - Exhibit "B"), which matter is already set 
for trial in July 2010. 
Discovery concluded on May 31, 2010 (see DE 531). 
Accordingly, the cross notice served by Jane Doe must be stricken/quashed and a 
protective order entered because the subpoena itself in invalid due to C.L.' s counsel's 
failure to comply with Rule 26(d) and discovery in Jane Doe (80893) has concluded. 
Rule 7.1 Certification 
I hereby certify that counsel for the respective parties communicated by e-mail in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues set forth above prior to the filing of this Motion and 
none of the issues were resolved. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an order granting 
Defendant's motion for protective order and motion to quash. Defendant further requests 
that this Court award his attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion, in 
accordance with Rule 37, Fed.R.Civ.P. and applicable Local Rules and specifically: 
a. Quash CL's subpoena attached as Exhibit "A"; 
b. Quash and/or strike Jane Doe's cross notice as to Exhibit "A" because 
Exhibit "A" is invalid and discovery has concluded in Jane Doe; 
c. Award attorneys to Defendant for CL and Jane Doe's noncompliance with 
these discovery matters; and 
d. for such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.
