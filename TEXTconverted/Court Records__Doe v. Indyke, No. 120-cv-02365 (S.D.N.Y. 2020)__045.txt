PROCEEDINGS

HONORABLE DEBRA C. FREEMAN (THE COURT):   This is 
2 
Judge Freeman.  This should be Jane Doe versus Indyke et 
3 
al.  It is 20-civ-2365, a case before Judge Liman and 
4 
myself. 
5 
Could I have your appearances, please, for the 
6 
record, starting on plaintiff's side? 
7 
MR. DANIEL J. KAISER:  Daniel Kaiser of Kaiser 
8 
Saurborn & Mair, your Honor, representing Jane Doe. 
9 
THE COURT:  Okay.  And on defendants' side? 
10 
MR. BENNET MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, your Honor. 
11 
Bennet Moskowitz, Troutman Pepper, representing the co-
12 
executors.  And I just discovered there was a kind of a 
13 
clerical error with the Proposed Scheduling Order filed last 
14 
week.  So I just wanted to put a note down that, when your 
15 
Honor pleases, I'd like to just note that for the record so we 
16 
can correct it. 
17 
 THE COURT:  That's fine.  Is there anyone else 
18 
currently on this call?  Do I have my clerk on?  Donna, are 
19 
you there? 
20 
THE CLERK:  I'm here, Judge. 
21 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Is there anyone else on the 
22 
line? 
23 
THE DEPUTY CLERK:  It's Aisha.  I'm on, too. 
24 
THE COURT:  Oh, my deputy's on, as well.

PROCEEDINGS

MR. JAMES HILL:  Good morning, your Honor.  This is 
2 
James Hill; I'm the reporter with ABC News, in listen-only 
3 
mode. 
4 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Anyone else on the line? 
5 
MALE:  A reporter from the New York Post. 
6 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, say it again, please?   
7 
MALE:  A reporter from the New York Post on 
8 
listen-only mode. 
9 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  I have a few things 
10 
in front of me.  First of all, I have the need to set a 
11 
Scheduling Order.  I also have a motion for plaintiff for 
12 
leave to proceed anonymously.  I also have a pro hac vice 
13 
application.  That pro hac application I have granted; it 
14 
just probably has not hit the docket yet.  But that one is 
15 
resolved.  I've also granted the motion to seal some papers 
16 
that were submitted in connection with the motion to 
17 
proceed anonymously.  So that's also newly hitting the 
18 
docket, my granting of that application. 
19 
With respect to a Scheduling Order, I'm wondering, 
20 
rather than to have a Scheduling Order that has everything 
21 
just based on a certain number of days after there is an 
22 
answer, waiting to see if there is an answer or if there is 
23 
a motion, if there is an answer, then I would propose to 
24 
set a schedule that has actual firm dates in it for things 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 4 of 22

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
5 
so that we don't have this wait with the date that is 100 
2 
days after this or 120 days after that or whatever.  If 
3 
there is as motion, I think we ought to have a discussion 
4 
about whether discovery should proceed in light of the 
5 
motion and if so, to what extent.  There is not automatic 
6 
stay of discovery when a motion to dismiss is filed.  But 
7 
there can at times -- it can at times make sense to stay 
8 
discovery in whole or in part.  The default is that 
9 
discovery would go forward, but I think it would be worth 
10 
taking a look at any schedule in light of any motion that's 
11 
pending, to see what the basis of the motion is and to see 
12 
what sort of discovery would make sense. 
13 
So I'm thinking of potentially -- well, actually, 
14 
I think what I'd like to do is find out from defendants, do 
15 
you intend to file a motion? 
16 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We do, your Honor.  Essentially, 
17 
there are statute of limitations issues, number one; and, 
18 
number two, there's a request for punitive damages, which 
19 
your Honor likely recalls that that's an issue that's been 
20 
ruled on in several cases already.  So those are at least 
21 
the two grounds that I'm currently aware of that we plan to 
22 
move on. 
23 
THE COURT:  Have the rulings on the punitive 
24 
damages point been consistent? 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 5 of 22

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
6 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  They have, your Honor.  And to put 
2 
a finer point on it, it's somewhat different here due to 
3 
the fact that the plaintiff, as far as I'm aware, is 
4 
couching the claim solely as Trafficking Victim Protection 
5 
Act claims.  However, there was a ruling in at least one 
6 
prior case on that.  But punitive damages generally, yes, 
7 
have been repeatedly dismissed on motions to dismiss 
8 
insofar as they've been asserted against the Epstein 
9 
estate. 
10 
THE COURT:  And assuming you file this motion, 
11 
would you be looking for any stay of discovery in whole or 
12 
in part? 
13 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, your Honor, our position is 
14 
not that we would necessarily file a formal motion to stay; 
15 
but consistent with prior positions, what I would say is 
16 
this, which is that it would be a shame for discovery to go 
17 
forward at full speed and potentially spin out of control 
18 
if -- and I don't know this yet and this is something that 
19 
is up to plaintiff to tell us whenever they please -- or 
20 
not -- but if there's any prospect of discussing 
21 
exploration of a resolution outside of litigation -- and I 
22 
guess what I'd say to that, your Honor, since we haven't 
23 
spoken a bit of a while for -- based on our track record, 
24 
is, you know, as a general matter, the estate is in favor 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 6 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
7 
of alternative dispute resolutions and settlements.  And, 
2 
of course, that's why we had the very successful Epstein 
3 
Victims' Compensation Program.  And as the Court may be 
4 
aware, the program's independent administrator recently 
5 
actually announced that the program has essentially 
6 
finished the front-end stage and is proceeding to wind 
7 
down.  It's awarded nearly 125 million to approximately 150 
8 
eligible claimants.  And that was roughly one year after it 
9 
launched.  You may recall that was back in June of 2020.  
10 
Ninety-two percent of eligible claimants accepted their 
11 
offers, and at the time of the announcement the program had 
12 
already paid out over 121 million to those claimants.   
13 
I can't go into on the estate side who or why 
14 
certain resolutions did not happen via the program; 
15 
however, again we are open as a general principle to 
16 
exploring with any claimants who wish to do so whether 
17 
there's a potential for resolution outside of litigation.  
18 
And that's true in this case as with any of the others that 
19 
remain. 
20 
MR. KAISER:  If I may, your Honor?  
21 
THE COURT:  Sure.  Who's this, please? 
22 
MR. KAISER:  Dan Kaiser.  Just on those points -- 
23 
I don't want to get into a lot of detail -- but the 
24 
victims' compensation fund was not successful, which 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 7 of 22

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
8 
[indiscernible] like, you know, it's not necessarily 
2 
relevant, although I had explicit discussions with the 
3 
administrator, and she was very explicit with me on the 
4 
phone how politics, you know, restrained her and entered 
5 
into what she did or didn't do with my client.  So -- and I 
6 
don't want to get into the details about that, but she was 
7 
very, very openly acknowledged of that.  And we're very 
8 
happy to have settlement discussions.  We've never 
9 
disguised that.  We've been open to it.  If the other side 
10 
wants to, for example, engage a mediator to see whether it 
11 
can be resolved, then we're happy to explore that.  And if 
12 
they're saying that the continuance at this point of 
13 
discovery would interfere with that process, I'm happy to 
14 
preliminarily have discussions about resolution to see if 
15 
it could happen without the need for discovery.  I won't 
16 
get into the statute of limitations issues -- I'm not sure 
17 
what the merits of that are, but we'll deal with them at 
18 
another time.  But, again, your Honor, I'm happy to have 
19 
those discussions; and if they're going to be had, 
20 
particularly in this case and the context and posture of 
21 
it, it should happen sooner rather than later. 
22 
THE COURT:  Sure.  Just a quick question about the 
23 
statute of limitations issues, if that defense is 
24 
successful, would it resolve the entire case or only part 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 8 of 22

9 
of the case? 
2 
MR. KAISER:  Well, I don't -- 
3 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I believe -- 
4 
THE COURT:  Mr. Moskowitz? 
5 
MR. KAISER:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 
6 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No apologies.  I didn't know if 
7 
that question was more for me, your Honor -- 
8 
THE COURT:  This is Mr. Moskowitz? 
9 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yeah.  I believe it's partial.  I 
10 
don't believe it's a total dismissal. 
11 
THE COURT:  All right.  So based on what I have 
12 
heard, my view is that, assuming the motion is made -- and 
13 
I accept that it likely will be -- that discovery should 
14 
still go forward, but it should go forward in part because 
15 
the case would not be fully resolved, anyway, even if the 
16 
motion were granted.  And so there's no reason to let 
17 
discovery be stalled.  But because of the parties' 
18 
expressed interest on both sides in pursuing settlement and 
19 
possibly because of the motion, discovery should be 
20 
scheduled with an eye toward what is practical.  So perhaps 
21 
there should be some time built in on the front end where 
22 
you can talk settlement; or perhaps it should be structured 
23 
so that certain things are done first that you know you 
24 
would likely have to do anyway but are not the most 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 9 of 22

10 
burdensome things and some other things that you might have 
2 
to do down the road that perhaps are more burdensome, we 
3 
have it on a schedule, you know when you're going to do it 
4 
if you have to, but perhaps you kick it a little bit 
5 
further down so that you don't spend unnecessary time, 
6 
money and effort on discovery that may not be needed.   
7 
With respect to settlement, you have a number of 
8 
options.  One option is that you talk between you without 
9 
the aid of a third-party mediator or other dispute-
10 
resolution professional.  You just talk between counsel as 
11 
counsel and you see what you can do to try to negotiate a 
12 
resolution.  I have great confidence in lawyers' skills in 
13 
advancing the ball in settlement.  Here there were some 
14 
unusual circumstances where this program was set up and 
15 
obviously a lot of claims were put there instead of put 
16 
before counsel to try to work something out.  But at this 
17 
stage of the game it seems to me the first thing you should 
18 
do is have good-faith conversations between you and see 
19 
where you are. 
20 
If that is not successful, you have a number of 
21 
options with respect to mediation.  You could go to the 
22 
court's mediation program -- and I'm happy to send you 
23 
there.  You can come before me, and I'm happy to host you.  
24 
Or you could retain a private mediator of your choice 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 10 of 22

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
11 
through whatever organizational or whatever individual 
2 
you're both comfortable with.  And I'm happy to have you do 
3 
that, as well, if that's something you should talk about.  
4 
But I do think that, if you're going to talk, the time to 
5 
talk is in fact sooner rather than later because I don't 
6 
want to see discovery stalled longer than necessary if the 
7 
case is not going to be resolved.  So if you build in some 
8 
time at the front end of the discovery schedule to talk 
9 
settlement, that means you should be talking settlement. 
10 
So I'm going to send you back to talk between 
11 
counsel about how you want to proceed with this.  I will 
12 
tell you that, if I have a conference before me on 
13 
settlement, I will require counsel to tell me that they've 
14 
tried as hard as they can on their own and they really do 
15 
need help, you know, that you're at impasse, you can't 
16 
think of anything else to do, you know, all the skills that 
17 
you have in settlement have been exhausted and you just 
18 
have no other idea how to proceed other than to ask for 
19 
outside help.  And then I am happy to try to help you break 
20 
through whatever log jam you've got.  I think even if 
21 
that's not a requirement for the mediation program or for 
22 
an outside mediator, it doesn't hurt to try on your own 
23 
first and get as far as you can and see whether you really 
24 
need the help or if so, to figure out exactly what the gap 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 11 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
12 
between the parties' positions is and just how much work 
2 
has to be done to get there. 
3 
So what I'm thinking is this.  Let me send you 
4 
back to the well.  Propose a discovery plan that, A, has in 
5 
mind that a motion is coming and that the parties are 
6 
interested in talking settlement; and, B, has firm dates in 
7 
it instead of 30 days after this and 20 days after that and 
8 
so on.  I will tell you what I would generally put in a 
9 
scheduling order, and you can modify it as you think would 
10 
be appropriate.  And if I think it's reasonable, I'll 
11 
approve it.  I would want a date for initial disclosures.  
12 
Usually that comes pretty quickly.  Usually it's within a 
13 
couple of weeks after I issue my Scheduling Order.   
14 
Then once you get the information on the initial 
15 
disclosures, assuming there's information that still hasn't 
16 
already been informally exchanged, I'd want a date for 
17 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories, 
18 
just to make sure that ball is rolling.  I will let you go 
19 
outside Local Rule 33.3A, go straight to B with respect to 
20 
the kinds of interrogatories you serve, to save some time 
21 
because A is a lot like the initial disclosures under 26A, 
22 
and it seems to me that it doesn't make sense to object 
23 
just because interrogatories go outside that rule when you 
24 
can just serve a second set and be there anyway.  I'm not 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 12 of 22

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
13 
talking about contention interrogatories.  Save those for 
2 
further down the pike.  I'm not talking about 
3 
interrogatories that are abusive or call for long, 
4 
narrative responses.  Use your judgment, please. 
5 
With respect to motions to amend or for joinder, 
6 
as soon as you reasonably have the idea as to whether 
7 
you've got the right claims and the right parties, let's 
8 
get that closed down so that something doesn't happen late 
9 
in the case that throws a monkey wrench into everything.  
10 
I'm looking for a deadline, a proposed deadline for motions 
11 
to amend or joinder.  If there's not going to be an 
12 
objection by your adversary, I'm not going to require the 
13 
motion.  So you've got to back up whatever deadline it is 
14 
in your head, think about drafting a proposed amended 
15 
pleading, sending it to your adversary saying would you 
16 
oppose this if I were to move to amend.  It doesn't have to 
17 
be consent; it just has to be I wouldn't object to it, I 
18 
wouldn't oppose it.  If there's not going to be an 
19 
opposition, let me know, and I'll just accept the amended 
20 
pleading for filing.  If there is going to be an objection, 
21 
I want a deadline in the Scheduling Order for motions to 
22 
amend or for joinder.  If you miss that deadline that's in 
23 
the Order, be aware it is an important deadline because if 
24 
you miss it, you're going to be in Rule 16 land with having 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
14 
to show good cause why you couldn't meet a date in a 
2 
Scheduling Order, and that liberal amendment standard of 
3 
Rule 15 can go out the window if you can't show good cause 
4 
for missing the deadline.  So give me a deadline for 
5 
motions to amend or joinder.  If you think there might 
6 
really be an amendment and you're worried about the 
7 
deadline, put your hand in the air and ask to have it 
8 
extended before that date comes.  Don't find yourself with 
9 
a problem under Rule 16.  Obviously, if something comes up 
10 
late in the game that was honestly something that couldn't 
11 
have been anticipated, you'll have good cause for a late 
12 
motion to amend; but, you know, don't risk it if you can 
13 
possibly avoid that. 
14 
And then a deadline for the close of fact 
15 
discovery, I'm going to try not to micromanage you other 
16 
than getting that ball rolling on document requests and 
17 
interrogatories.  I'm not going to require you to set firm 
18 
dates for depositions or the like unless you start running 
19 
into problems and there's no other way to do it than to 
20 
have court-ordered dates.  I don't anticipate that. 
21 
With respect to any experts, generally what I 
22 
would do is I would say if you've got the affirmative 
23 
burden of proof on an issue, get your expert reports out

within 30 days of the close of fact discovery, rebuttal

reports 30 days after that, and then you'll have a small 
2 
window for expert depositions.  If there's something 
3 
unusual going on here, if you think that schedule does not 
4 
work, talk about it.  But that's what I would ordinarily 
5 
do. 
6 
And that's all I've got on that.  Does that sound 
7 
reasonable for you to go back and talk and see what you can 
8 
come up with? 
9 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Bennet Moskowitz.  Yes, your 
10 
Honor.  And if I could, before we close as far as 
11 
discussion, I did want to address that clerical issue 
12 
because, notwithstanding that we're not going to -- the 
13 
Court's not going to enter the proposal that was already 
14 
submitted, I do want to correct it for the docket. 
15 
THE COURT:  Sure.  I have it in front of me.  What 
16 
was it? 
17 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  It has the wrong signature 
18 
page.  It looks like a signature page from another action 
19 
against the estate. 
20 
THE COURT:  Oh, dear. 
21 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Apologies if that was on our end.  
22 
I'm not even certain yet.  We certainly filed the -- 
23 
THE COURT:  That's what happens when there are too 
24 
many cases.  All right, no problem.

16 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We tried to reduce the number.  So 
2 
I would like to -- I don't know if the Court can remove 
3 
that from the docket or -- I just don't want to have it 
4 
hanging there.  You know, obviously, the other attorney 
5 
from the other case shouldn't be reflected on this docket. 
6 
THE COURT:  We can figure out something.  If you 
7 
want to just send a -- put a letter on the docket saying 
8 
that it's withdrawn.  I mean, it won't disappear from the 
9 
docket.  I mean, it's not something that would ordinarily 
10 
get sealed.  But you can write a letter and just indicate 
11 
that there's an error if you want to have the docket 
12 
reflect that. 
13 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.   
14 
THE COURT:  Right?  I mean, for anyone on the call 
15 
who's listening in on mute who's a member of the press, 
16 
there's as document on the docket that has the wrong 
17 
signature page.  So please ignore it.   
18 
Anyway, just put some letter on the docket about 
19 
it, and I'll deal with it when I get that letter from you. 
20 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Understood.  Thank you, your 
21 
Honor. 
22 
THE COURT:  Okay.  That --

MR. KAISER:  Your Honor --

MR. KAISER:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  It's Dan 
2 
Kaiser.  Just one point of clarification.  To the motion to 
3 
proceed anonymously still needs to be ruled upon, correct? 
4 
THE COURT:  Yes.  Yes.  I was just going to turn 
5 
to that. 
6 
MR. KAISER:  Okay.  Yes.  Okay. 
7 
THE COURT:  Anything else about scheduling? 
8 
By the way, you have some other things in the 
9 
Proposed Scheduling Order like a date to provide HIPAA 
10 
releases.  That's fine.  If you want to add some things in 
11 
there that you think are worth having in there that you 
12 
want to have, you know, the power of the court behind to 
13 
make sure things happen by a certain date, you can.  Those 
14 
things that I outlined for you are the things that I 
15 
require to be in a Scheduling Order, initial disclosures, 
16 
date to serve initial document requests and 
17 
interrogatories, deadline for amendment of pleadings and 
18 
joinder, deadline for fact discovery, and then the schedule 
19 
for expert discovery.  If there's something else in there 
20 
that you think would be helpful, you know, you can add it 
21 
in there by agreement.   
22 
And also, you can stipulate to modify an interim 
23 
dates in my Scheduling Order that you want if it all wraps 
24 
up at the same point in time.  I want to see it end the 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 17 of 22

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
18 
same way.  If you agree that fact discovery can slide into 
2 
the period for expert discovery and you're in agreement it 
3 
can get done, it's okay.  If you agree that you can move 
4 
some other date in there because you're talking settlement 
5 
but you're still looking at the same end date, you don't 
6 
need leave of Court to do that; you can just stipulate to 
7 
that.  If it's the amendment deadline, let me know that 
8 
you're stipulating so that we don't have any confusion 
9 
there about what rule you're under if there's a motion that 
10 
comes in late.  Okay? 
11 
All right -- 
12 
MR. KAISER:  Yes, your Honor. 
13 
THE COURT:  -- with respect to the motion to 
14 
proceed anonymously, I've looked at the motion, I've looked 
15 
at what was put on the docket for the Court's view in 
16 
unredacted form, I've looked at the reply.  My inclination 
17 
at this point is to grant the motion to proceed 
18 
anonymously.  It may be revisited at a later date, but I 
19 
think at this juncture that is the better course, and so 
20 
I'm going to allow this case, like the other cases in the 
21 
court, to proceed with plaintiff as Jane Doe.  So I'm going 
22 
to grant that. 
23 
Is there anything else?   
24 
You know what, let me give you one other thing to 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 18 of 22

19 
do, which is after -- I'm sorry, which is to put in the 
2 
Proposed Scheduling Order a date by which you'll send me a 
3 
joint status report on how things are going, both with 
4 
respect to the status of discovery and the status of your 
5 
settlement talks.  Just figure out what would be a logical 
6 
point in time to report back to me, and put in the date so 
7 
that I don't lose track of the case. 
8 
With respect to a status report on the settlement, 
9 
this is going to be a publicly filed document, so I really 
10 
don't want you to put your confidential settlement 
11 
discussions in the letter -- that's not the purpose of it, 
12 
and I don't really think that belongs on the public docket.  
13 
So what I mean by a status letter on settlement is the 
14 
following.  I've taken to saying this a lot in cases these 
15 
days when I ask for status reports on settlement.  From 
16 
best to worst, the best kind of status letter you can put 
17 
on the docket to the worst kind of status letter you can 
18 
put on the docket, the best is, "We have a resolution in 
19 
principle, Judge."  That's obviously great.  Next best is, 
20 
"We are talking seriously. Because of that -- and we think 
21 
we're optimistic -- we'd like a little bit more time to get 
22 
back to you.  We think maybe we need a little bit of 
23 
discovery; but, you know, we think this is going well."  
24 
And then propose how you want to proceed from there.  "We'd 
25 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 19 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
20 
like some further extensions on deadlines in light of 
2 
this," or, "We'd like another status report letter date," 
3 
or something.  Next is, "We've been talking seriously, and 
4 
we're having difficulty.  We really would like to try the 
5 
assistance of a mediator, you or the mediation program or 
6 
outside mediator," or whatever it is you want to propose; 
7 
you let me know.  Next is, "We've been talking seriously.  
8 
We're not getting anywhere.  We don't think we're going to 
9 
get anywhere.  We think this case has to be litigated.  We 
10 
think there's absolutely no hope."  If I see a letter like 
11 
that, I'll probably have another call with you and say, 
12 
"Are you sure there's nothing that can help you, because I 
13 
know both sides are interested."  And I'm usually more 
14 
optimistic than the parties when I get a letter like that.  
15 
The worst letter you can put on the docket is, "Even though 
16 
I know you're interested in settlement, we've done nothing 
17 
on this front.  We haven't been talking.  We haven't 
18 
advanced the ball at all since the last time we had a 
19 
conference two months ago.  It's been completely stagnant 
20 
on that front."  If you're interested in settlement, pursue 
21 
it; try to make progress and give me an actual progress 
22 
report.  Okay? 
23 
MR. KAISER:  Yes, your Honor. 
24 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Understood.

September 7 -- was that the day?  What was the date I gave
