5.
Defendant EPSTEIN is a natural person, who is an adult, and who resides
and/or does business in Palm Beach County, Florida, and who committed the acts alleged
within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida, within the boundaries of the United
States District Court in and for the Southern District of Florida. Defendant KELLEN is a
natural person, who is an adult, believed to reside in the State of New York, but who
committed some of the acts alleged within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida,
within the boundaries of the United States District Court in and for the Southern District of
Florida. 
   
6.
Defendant EPSTEIN is believed to now reside in Palm Beach, Florida but
claims to be a resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
FACTS
7.
Defendant EPSTEIN was, at all times relevant to this action, a part time
resident of Palm Beach County, Florida. All acts complained of herein occurred at his estate
residence in the Town of Palm Beach, Florida.
8.
Defendant EPSTEIN has a history of enticing young women, who are minors
(under 18 years of age), and soliciting them to engage in prostitution for his own sexual
gratification.
9.
Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he employed for this
purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN, conspired together, and/or with
unnamed others, to solicit young women of the type Defendant EPSTEIN preferred, blonde,
attractive in appearance, and younger than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification
for him by engaging in acts of prostitution.
10.
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal conspiracy to 
solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including the Plaintiff.

11.
From about June, 2003 until on or about February, 2005, Defendants
EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to come to Defendant
EPSTEIN’s home and provide Defendant EPSTEIN with “massages” which escalated into
sexual encounters between Defendant EPSTEIN and the Plaintiff designed to fulfill his
unnatural sexual desires for young women or even younger girls who were minors. These
acts included Defendant EPSTEIN’s  request that  he wanted the encounter to be like a
“porn video.” Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for the Plaintiff to say, including calling
out his name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual act “harder,”while he touched
the Plaintiff’s vagina  with a vibrator or with his fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in
the presence of the Plaintiff after demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in
provocative sexual poses. Defendant EPSTEIN would pay the Plaintiff a fee of $200 on
each occasion  after he ejaculated while masturbating in the presence of the Plaintiff. 
12.
Defendant EPSTEIN touched Plaintiff’s vagina, or penetrated Plaintiff’s
vagina, using his fingers and/or a vibrator on multiple occasions, during the time that
Plaintiff was a minor, causing personal injury to her.         
13.
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 and in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422(b)
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff
to engage in acts of prostitution, when the Plaintiff was under the age of 18, approximately
on or about the following dates that Plaintiff can document based on payments received:
6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04, 6/7/04, 7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04 and 11/9/04.
In addition, Plaintiff believes that there were as many as 10 to 20 other additional occasions
during this time frame that Defendant EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform
prostitution services, all during the time that she was a minor.

14.    Defendants’ manner of persuasion, inducement and/or enticement of the
Plaintiff to commit acts of prostitution was  knowing and wilful. Defendants in committing the
above offenses did use a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly
persuade, induce or entice Doe II and other minor females to engage in prostitution, and/or
a commercial sex act, and/or to commit a lewd or lascivious act and/or a sexual battery in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422 (b).  The facility or means of
interstate and/or foreign commerce includes but is not limited to: telephone and cell phone
communications between Defendants, wherein Defendant EPSTEIN would solicit the
Plaintiff by and through Defendant KELLEN, who would, after speaking by telephone and
cell phone with Defendant EPSTEIN, solicit the Plaintiff by telephone and cell phone.
