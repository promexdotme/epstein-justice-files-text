PROFESSIONAL COMMENDATIONS: 
A letter of commendation regarding clinical work in the classroom within a public school 
system: 
December 3, 2001 
To Whom It May Concern: 
This is to report that the San Mateo County Office of Education, Special Education programs, 
has benefited from the services of The Children's Psychological Health Center, specifically its 
Cornerstone Therapeutic School Project. 
We have worked together for the past six years. Under the leadership of Gilbert Kliman, MD., 
the Center has trained members of our teaching and school psychology staff to carry out a 
mental health service on our premises. We now have a collaborative project in its sixth year for 
our special education preschool children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) and 
for those with Serious Emotional Disorders (SED) which interfere with their education. As an 
alternative to sending children to a private nonpublic special education school for extremely 
intensive mental health services at significant cost, this project has created and provides just 
such intensive service within a public preschool special class program at 65 Tower Road, San 
Mateo. 
To my knowledge, among the 30 children served so far under the collaborative project, we are 
seeing cognitive, social and human gains which have decreased the gap between these children 
and their typically developing peers. Several families and children are thriving with less 
intensive special education service or returned to regular education class. Not only has the 
family and child suffering been reduced, the burden to taxpayers is also reduced. The children 
have been able to remain in the community, and some who were functioning as severely autistic 
and retarded now appear to be developing within a somewhat normal range. We are pleased 
with the quality of special education services our County provides for preschoolers with PDD or 
SED. We are also gratified with the research results provided by The Children's Psychological 
Health Center. 
We recommend the Cornerstone project to other school systems, so that they consider it an 
important opportunity should they be able to collaborate similarly with The Children's 
Psychological Health Center. At California's common cost of $15,000 to $40,000 or more a 
year, for a special education child who needs full time special education services and auxiliary 
intensive help, the savings for even one child's 12-year career of intensive services in special 
education can be substantial. The savings from one of the successes we have seen may equal the 
costs of the entire Cornerstone project with the 30 children helped so far. 
16 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 44-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 16 of 23
We have not yet seen any failures. The agency is showing measurable cognitive gains for our 
collaborative work which, according to their research, averages 20 to 28 points in independent 
WPPSI testing of the children in the Cornerstone program. The techniques are far more 
economical to use than we have found with the Lovaas method, which we also implement for 
some students. We have also seen the techniques transmitted to special education teachers as 
well as inexperienced therapists. 
I invite you to visit our project in action. 
Sincerely, 
JAYS. PARNES, Ed.D.

MAJOR FEDERAL COURT FORENSIC ACTIVITIES: 
EVALUATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HEARD IN FEDERAL COURT, HANNIBAL 
MISSOURI, November 15, 2001 
Under Dr. Kliman's leadership, a Children's Psychological Health Center team of five clinicians 
and two administrative staff has been at work since May 2, 2001 conducting a behavioral audit 
regarding the psychiatric conditions and the residential treatment of over 100 children (mostly 
ages 13 to 17) at Heartland Christian Academy, as requested by the Academy's general counsel. 
2001: Doe vs. Three Springs Treatment Center, Nashville, TN. 
2004: Does vs. L.K. Baliredy et al (An international child trafficking matter). Five days of 
deposition. 
2004 Doe vs. State of New Mexico and Arthur Brokup. 
MAJOR STATE COURT CASES: 
Some cases of public health significance, concerning allegedly traumatized minors in care of 
governmental or institutional agencies: 
Does vs. OK Boys Ranch and State of Washington: 44 children in care at a state-licensed 
rehabilitation and foster care-related center were allegedly allowed to abuse each other while 
staff and therapists did not report harmful activities of which they knew, Dr. Kliman opined. The 
plaintiff children have to date all received settlements in four phases of this litigation over a nine 
year period, with Dr. Kliman as the principal expert. 
York vs. ChaparralNictor Treatment Facility. Orange County Superior Court. An eleven year 
old child severely and chronically molested by a residential treatment staff member was 
evaluated and an opinion given by Dr. Kliman concerning harm and how to rehabilitate the child 
as much as possible. Implications for standards of residential care are contained within the case. 
Carlson vs. Ray-Lara Foster Home. Orange County Superior Court. Dr. Kliman evaluated and 
testified concerning a twelve year old boy who was allegedly molested by a foster father and had 
17 

Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 44-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 17 of 23
to rescue himself. The foster father's partner was negligent, Dr. Kliman opined. The judge 
agreed and awarded the child compensation for psychological damages. 
Does vs. Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Dr. Kliman was the lead psychiatric witness. The case 
settled after six days of his deposition testimony. 
Does vs. Salesian Order Western Region. Dr. Kliman was the lead psychiatric witness. The case 
settled after nine days of his deposition testimony and two days of trial. 
Does v South Dakota School for the Deaf. Multiple boys were molested by an older student. The 
state school administration was allegedly negligent and major psychological damages were 
claimed. Dr. Kliman served as the principal plaintiffs' expert on administrative liability issues 
and psychological damages. The case settled with major compensation for the plaintiffs during 
the time of jury deliberations. 
CHILD PSYCHIATRIC EXPERT TESTIMONY: 
Dr. Kliman helped set legal precedents for the inclusion of psychiatric testimony in matters 
concerning wrongful death of a parent and loss of parental services, in both New York State and 
California. He has testified in over 275 cases including over 100 trials. A Federal Rule 26 list is 
available on request and on www.expertchildpsychiatry.com. His courtroom and deposition 
testimony experience includes cases of institutional negligence of children leading to 
psychological trauma, negligent foster care, loss of parental services due to wrongful deaths, 
psychological trauma as part of personal injury of adults and children, childhood molestation, 
sexual harassment, termination of parental rights, and disputed custody. Since 2000 about 30% 
of his forensic work has been requested by defense, about 70% by plaintiffs, with the defense 
tasks increasing markedly in recent years. 
Dr. Kliman's evaluations and testimony regarding 16 children negligently cared for and abused 
at The Kiwanis' OK Boys' Ranch, Olympia, WA, helped lead to settlements and awards, 
totalling $25,000,000. Responding to disclosures in that case, many improvements have occurred 
in the publicly funded and licensed institutional care of children throughout the State of 
Washington, according to newspaper accounts. 
Dr. Kliman's evaluations and opinions, together with that of The Children's Psychological 
Trauma Center team led by Robert Wynne MFCC, led to record-making $8,000,000 loss of 
parental and other services compensation for 17 bereaved subsistence-economy Alaskan Inupiat 
Native Americans (Smith vs. Ryan Airlines, Anchorage, 1997). 
Principal expert regarding institutional negligence and psychological damages in Does vs. 
Rudolph Kos and the Diocese of Dallas, Dallas 1997. The Catholic Church of Dallas was held 
liable for institutional negligence, testimony concerning the need for major psychiatric treatment 
planning was accepted by the jury, and $119,000,000--including punitive damages against the 
Church--was awarded to the 11 plaintiffs, by unanimous decision.

OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND RECOGNITION: 
In response to the mental health needs of families following recent massive firestorms, United 
Way printed and distributed 10,000 copies of "My Fire Story -- a Guided Activity Workbook for 
Children, Families and Teachers," co-authored with Edward Oklan, M.D. Copies can be obtained 
from Family Development Press, 1010 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Kentfield, CA 94960. The 
State of Iowa purchased rights to reproduce 10,000 copies of "My Book about The Attack on 
America - a Guided Activity Workbook for Children, Families and Teachers", published in 2001. 
During 1996 - 2002 Sophie Murvis Foundation, The Windholz Foundation, The Atkinson, 
Cadence Corporation, Irving Harris Foundation and The Stullsaft Foundations have recently 
awarded grants to Dr. Kliman as principal investigator for his Cornerstone Therapeutic Nursery 
project, serving seriously disturbed preschoolers in the San Mateo Office of Education. 
Presentations on The Cornerstone Therapeutic Nursery Project have been made by Dr. Kliman 
during 1997 through 2002 at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute and the Seattle Institute 
for Psychoanalysis. 
Three documentary videotapes concerning Dr. Kliman's psychotherapies of disturbed children 
treated by him using this method in a therapeutic special education class are now available for 
scientific and educational purposes, parental permission having been gained. Such use requires a 
confidentiality agreement. 
Tape I: The Cornerstone Method. 
Tape II: Treatment of an Autistic Boy 
Tape III: Unique Features of The Cornerstone Method 
As a pilot application of his techniques for preschoolers, Dr. Kliman opened a Cornerstone 
Therapeutic Nursery at the Salvation Army Shelter for homeless families in January 1998, 
serving seven homeless families with preschool children. He is supervising the project weekly as 
Medical Director of The Children's Psychological Trauma Center. Unedited videotapes of that 
project are available to scientists and educators with a confidentiality agreement. The Wright 
Institute has provided a psychology intern to conduct the treatment under Dr. Kliman's training 
and supervision. The California School of Professional Psychology has assigned a doctoral thesis 
candidate to Dr. Kliman's supervision to study the I.Q. rise phenomenon previously documented 
in Cornerstone therapies. 
Peer-reviewed publications of Dr. Kliman's work with foster children appear in Zelman, A: 
Interventions with High Risk Children, Jason Aronson 1997 (Chapter by Kliman on Controlled 
Assessment of The Personal Life History Book Method for Foster Children). Results of Dr. 
Kliman's Cornerstone Method are also reported extensively in that book, focusing on the I.Q. rise 
phenomenon.

The Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy of a Four Year Old Boy, 1999. An ongoing archive 
made with generous permission of the child's family, now totaling over 25 hours. This 
child has had severe stressors in his life, and suffers behavioral and overanxious 
symptoms. He has impulse dyscontrol, attentional deficits, and expressive language 
difficulties from which he can be seen to be recovering. Two excerpted tapes have been 
created to illustrate features of the child's pathology, and of the response to interpretive 
aspects of treatment. Gilbert Kliman, M.D. is the psychoanalyst, and the treatment is 
conducted three times a week, with parent guidance every two weeks. The videographer 
is in the room. This may be the only existing video archive of a child analysis conducted 
by a certified child psychoanalyst.

Scientific and Educational Video Archives under Dr. Kliman's supervision: 
With parental permission, The Children's Psychological Health Center, under Dr. Kliman's 
leadership, is collecting unedited treatment documents of a special method of treatment in a real 
life space, called "The Cornerstone therapeutic preschool method." Now totaling over 200 video 
archive hours, eight different California therapists working with various educator teams have 
recorded their Cornerstone therapeutic preschool method work, Beginning in 1995, this archive 
started with Gilbert Kliman, M.D. working for a year as daily in-classroom therapist in a public 
special education school. He was assisted by Leanne Runyan and Gail Hernandez as the teachers 
at the San Mateo Early Childhood Education Center, a preschool special education facility of 
The County of San Mateo. A second team under his supervision included work at The San 
Francisco Unified School District (Vanessa Vigilante and Esther Kronenberg). Third and fourth 
teams were at The Salvation Army Gateway Shelter (Vanessa Vigilante as therapist and Lynda 
Byrd as teacher, Deanna Reardon as therapist and Lynda Byrd as teacher). A fourth was at The 
Cadence Cornerstone Site at Mt. Pleasant School, San Jose (Karita Hummer, therapist and Kathy 
Krall, teacher). Fifth team therapy was provided by Jane Christmas. The sixth team therapists 
was Dr. Miquela Diaz Hope, the seventh Molly Franklin, MFT. All have been extensively 
videotaped carrying out the method. An eighth team was assembled in late 2002, when Linda 
Hirshfeld Ph.D. joined as Fellow in Cornerstone Therapy. In 2001 Mike McDonald, Ed.D. 
became Special Education Director of Cornerstone School. All the treatments are have been 
under principal supervision of Dr. Kliman with additional supervision by Mali Mann, M.D., 
Myrna Frankel, Ed.D., and Jan Baeuerlen, M.D. 
Linda Hirshfeld, Ph.D. of the Ann Martin 
Center is conducting the archival work for her Cornerstone Services. 
A professional researcher/ training confidentiality agreement is required to study this archive.
