MOTION TO WITHDRAW AS COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF 
 
Pursuant to V.I. Supreme Court Rule 211.1.16(b) and V.I.R.Civ.P. 6-5, Quintairos, 
Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A. and Kyle R. Waldner, Esq. (collectively, the “Firm”), hereby move 
to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff GHISLAINE MAXWELL. In support hereof, the 
Firm states: 
1. 
The Firm was retained as counsel for Plaintiff pursuant to a certain engagement 
agreement, which required Plaintiff to timely pay the Firm’s invoices for services rendered in 
this matter. The agreement also gave the Firm the right to terminate the engagement and 
withdraw from this representation for non-payment of any invoice. 
2. 
The Firm provided legal services to Plaintiff in connection with this matter and 
invoiced Plaintiff for legal fees and expenses incurred. Thereafter, despite repeated requests, 
Plaintiff has failed to make payments to satisfy the Firm’s outstanding invoices. The Firm has

determined that this representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on it and has 
been rendered unreasonably difficult by these failures. 
3. 
On August 1, 2022, the Firm notified Plaintiff through her representatives 
(including her brother, Kevin Maxwell) that unless payment was received, it would seek 
withdrawal. Having not received the requested payment, on August 16, 2022 the Firm 
communicated to Plaintiff via certified mail, addressed to FCI Tallahassee, P.O. Box 5000, 
Tallahassee, FL 32314, with a copy by email to Plaintiff’s representatives, that it has terminated 
its representation of Plaintiff in this matter pursuant to V.I.S.CT.R. 211.1.16(b) and would 
withdraw as counsel. The Firm advised that Plaintiff should secure substitute counsel as soon as 
possible, and that it would arrange for a swift transfer of the file to Plaintiff’s new counsel.  
4. 
The termination of the attorney-client relationship is addressed by V.I.S.CT.R. 
211.1.16, which provides in part that, “a lawyer may withdraw from representing the interests of 
the client if: (1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests 
of the client; … (5) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding 
the lawyer's services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless 
the obligation is fulfilled; (6) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden 
on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or (7) other good cause 
for withdrawal exists.” 
5. 
Given the present circumstances, withdrawal at this point can be accomplished 
without material adverse impact upon Plaintiff,1 while compelling the Firm to represent a client

Two motions are presently pending: (1) the Estate’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s 
Complaint; and (2) the Government of the Virgin Islands’ Motion to Intervene. Both motions are

not paying its invoices would represent an unreasonable financial burden upon it. Accordingly, 
the Firm should be permitted to withdraw pursuant to V.I.S.CT.R. 211.1.16(b)(1). 
6. 
In support of this motion, pursuant to V.I.R.Civ.P. 6-5, the Firm submits the 
attached verified statement and updated civil litigant data form for Plaintiff.  Further, as reflected 
in the certificate of service below, these moving papers will be served upon Plaintiff via U.S. 
Mail.   
WHEREFORE, the Firm respectfully asks this Court to grant it leave to withdraw its 
appearance on behalf of Plaintiff, to relieve and absolve it of further responsibility in this matter, 
to stay all existing deadlines for sixty (60) day to afford Plaintiff time to obtain new counsel, and 
grant such other and further relief as this Court deems proper and just.

fully briefed. The parties have not yet had a Rule 16 conference and discovery has not yet 
commenced. Given the posture of this matter, the Firm’s withdrawal can be accomplished 
without material adverse effect on Plaintiff because there is time for new counsel to appear and 
get up to speed before the discovery phase in this matter commences.  In an abundance of 
caution, the Firm further requests that the Court enter a sixty (60) day stay of this matter to 
afford Plaintiff time to obtain new counsel.
