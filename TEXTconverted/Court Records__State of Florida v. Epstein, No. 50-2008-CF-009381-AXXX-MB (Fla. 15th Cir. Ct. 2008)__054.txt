MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Good afternoon, 
Judge, Jack Goldberger and Robert Critton 
on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein. 
THE COURT: 
And I'm guessing that, 
Mr. Kuvin, if I grant the motion to unseal 
that which has been sealed, your motion to 
intervene will be moot. 
MR. KUVIN: 
Will be. 
THE COURT: 
I thought so. 
This is 
what I'm thinking and -- oh, we've got 
more. 
MS. BURNS: 
One more appearance, 
excuse me, Judge, Barbara Burns on behalf 
of the state of Florida, the state 
attorney's office of the 15th Judicial 
Circuit. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Procedurally, 
I think the way that this came to us is 
that at the conclusion or at some point 
during a plea conference between the state 
of Florida and Mr. Epstein, the state and 
the defense hand an agreed order to 
Judge Puccillo. 
MS. BURNS: 
Puccillo. 
THE COURT: 
And asked her to sign an

agreement to seal some portion of some 
documents, which she signed off on and now 
it is the intervener's and the Post's 
motion to unseal those documents; is that 
kind of procedurally where we are? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Procedurally not 
exactly correct, I don't know if you want 
me to clarify that. 
THE COURT: 
Please do. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, this 
started during the course of a plea 
colloquy in Mr. Epstein's state proceeding 
before Judge Puccillo, who is a retired 
senior judge who was filling in for 
Judge Mcsorley on that day, who was the 
judge assigned to this division. 
It was a 
plea agreement with the state attorney's 
office and it is normal and consistent with 
any plea colloquy Judge Puccillo asked the 
defense whether there were any other 
promises or inducements for Mr. Epstein to 
enter into his plea agreement other than 
what was contained in the state standard 
plea agreement that we had. 
I felt 
obligated under the circumstances to alert

to the Court that there was a confidential 
agreement between Mr. Epstein's 
Mr. Epstein's attorneys and the United 
States attorney's office for the Southern 
District of Florida which would have been 
triggered upon the successful taking of the 
plea by Judge Puccillo. 
In other words, if the plea was 
accepted by Judge Puccillo, there's a 
confidential agreement between U.S. 
attorney's office and the defense that 
would be triggered and they would agree not 
to take some actions against Mr. Epstein. 
I advised Judge Puccillo of that, and at 
that time she said she would like to see 
the matter sealed in the court file. 
I 
said fine, and then we later --
I then 
filed that document, and the clerk's office 
notified me and said we need an order 
sealing this, and we submitted an order to 
seal the document. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Is there 
anybody here from the U.S. attorney's 
office? 
Has anybody notified them, or is 
there a dog in this fight or do they care?

If they're a party to this confidential 
thing, wouldn't you think that they might 
be. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, they 
have been noticed. 
They have taken a 
position in parallel proceedings that this 
matter should remain confidential, and they 
have done that in federal court, and I 
believe that is their position still. 
MR. 
EDWARDS: 
Your Honor, I have been 
in communication with the U.S. attorney's 
office, and they are not taking a position 
on this issue, which is why they're not in 
court right now. 
THE COURT: 
What's going on in 
federal court? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
There are a number 
of civil cases that are pending right now. 
THE COURT: 
And they're talking about 
the same documents that are under seal here 
in our court? 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Yes. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, your Honor, and 
I will address that at the appropriate time 
what's going on here.

THE COURT:

So thank you, 
Mr. Goldberger for getting that 
straightened out. 
MR. GERBER: 
one other point. 
Judge, just to clarify 
THE COURT: 
Sure. 
MR. GERBER: 
I think actually there's 
an additional step because Mr. Goldberger 
on behalf of Mr. Epstein or Mr. Critton I 
believe filed motion, and I think that that 
will tell us who goes first today and who 
has the burden today. 
THE COURT: 
This is -- and I'm 
thinking outloud that my take on that is 
that my review of the file shows that the 
appropriate steps to seal these documents 
wasn't followed initially. 
I'm looking at 
it as it would be whoever's moving to have 
them sealed, it's their burden to prove the 
steps that you have to prove to get things 
sealed by the Court, and so that's --
I 
hinted last meeting that we all had 
together but that's where I'd go, so I'd 
shift the burden over to the federal 
government and to Mr. Epstein, that's what

I'm thinking. 
Let me ask first go over to 
the Post, Ms. Shullman, what are your 
thoughts on that procedure? 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Your Honor, I think 
that's the correct procedure here. 
I think 
Mr. Epstein's motion to make court records 
confidential tacitly admits what we 
suspected last time, which was that the 
initial closure of the documents was not 
done pursuant to the acceptable procedures. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Mr. Berger, 
Mr. Edwards, that's all right with you? 
MR. EDWARDS: 
We agree. 
MR. GERBER: 
That's what my point 
was, yes, your Honor, thank you. 
THE COURT: 
you think? 
Mr. Goldberger, what do 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That's fine, your 
Honor, with the -- I'll wait until after 
the proceeding. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
You may 
proceed. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Judge, as I said to 
clarify the record, this matter started 
during the course of Mr. Epstein's plea

colloquy in state court and just so that 
the record was clear that all inducements 
for Mr. Epstein's plea was on the record 
when Judge Puccillo asked me if there had 
been any promises made to Mr. Epstein, I 
think properly and ethically we told the 
Court that there was an agreed --
confidential agreement with the federal 
government that was in place that basically 
said we will not prosecute Mr. Epstein for 
federal offenses if the state plea 
agreement is accepted by the Court and 
Mr. Epstein's sentence is imposed. 
The state proceeding was over at the 
time that I advised Judge Puccillo that, in 
other words, we had gone through the plea 
colloquy and I simply was advising her of 
this other agreement. 
It was 
Judge Puccillo who then asked us to 
approach, and the Court has a copy of that 
transcript, I believe. 
It was 
Judge Puccillo that said I'd like to have 
that document sealed in the court file, and 
I acquiesced to that, I said that's fine. 
So, first, as a preliminary matter,

it wasn't like we were coming into court on 
that day and asking to seal something, so 
it would have been presumptuous of me to 
file something to request to have something 
sealed when it came up during the course of 
the proceeding, and, in fact, the committee 
notes on the rule of judicial 
administration talk about that and say 
matters come up all the time during the 
course of hearings and the fact that 
something is not filed in advance does not 
necessarily taint the entire process, so we 
agreed to come forward and file our motion 
to seal after the fact, because we didn't 
know this matter would be coming up. 
But having said that, Judge, this 
confidential agreement was not part of any 
state plea agreement, it's not part of the 
proceedings, it was ancillary to the state 
proceedings and it had nothing to do with 
the state proceedings. 
As an accommodation 
to Judge Puccillo, we filed it in the court 
file. 
Quite frankly, it's unnecessary, it 
doesn't need to be there, and the simplest 
approach would be to simply remove it from

We didn't 
have for it to be there. 
It's not part of 
the plea, it's not part of the state 
resolution of the case, and that would be 
the simple logical approach to that. 
If the Court is inclined not do that 
12 
or if the parties object to that, then I 
think we move onto some other very, very 
important issues in this case and for both 
the intervenors in this case as well as the 
Palm Beach Post motion for access to this 
proceeding for really two very, very 
significant reasons, they are in the wrong 
place and they're attempting to march up 
the wrong hill here, your Honor. 
This matter needs to -- has to be 
litigated in federal court before 
Judge Marra who has already heard hearings 
on this matter. 
Now, at our last 
abbreviated hearing two weeks ago, I told 
you for the first time that there have been 
two hearings in front of Judge Marra on 
this very issue, whether this 
nonprosecution agreement and that's the 
matter that is sealed in your court file,

whether this nonprosecution agreement 
should be released to the plaintiffs for 
their use.

Judge Marra heard two hearings on 
this matter and the court has those orders. 
And in the first hearing Judge Marra very, 
very, carefully balanced the 
confidentiality issues of the 
nonprosecution agreement, the intent of the 
parties as well of the rules of criminal 
procedure that I will talk about in a 
moment, with the plaintiff's right to know 
what's going on and to have access to this 
agreement. 
And Judge Marra crafted an 
order and in the nature of a protective 
order and said, plaintiffs, you can have 
this nonprosecution agreement, you can use 
it, you can review it, you cannot give it 
to anyone else other than your clients, and 
if you want to use it or you want to give 
it to your clients, you need to tell them 
about this order that is not to be 
disclosed to anybody else. 
And these 
plaintiffs that are sitting here will tell 
you that from day one they have had this

nonprosecution agreement, they have it for 
their use, they know every clause that's in 
that nonprosecution agreement, and I 
suggest to the Court as to their motions 
why are we here; they have an agreement 
already. 
They went back to Judge Marra 
sometime thereafter and asked the Court to 
expand their use of the nonprosecution 
agreement, and they said, Judge Marra, we 
have the nonprosecution agreement but we 
would like to be able to disclose that 
agreement to other sides, and Judge Marra 
in another carefully crafted order said, 
nuh-uh, no, you have not satisfied your 
burden, you cannot disseminate this to 
anyone else, and the order that I have 
entered remains in place, but most 
significantly he said, you know what, this 
is without prejudice. 
If you have some basis, you have some 
need that you have not briefed, you have 
not litigated with me yet concerning 
dissemination of nonprosecution agreement, 
come back to me and I'll review it for you.

And they have every right to do so, and 
they have not done so, and it is this 
15 
motion to intervene that they filed in this 
court is simply an effort to skirt and to 
avoid and to go behind the order of 
Judge Marra that dealt with this issue 
already. 
And I think just for the purpose of 
our hearing, we need to have the two orders 
of Judge Marra entered into the record of 
this proceeding. 
I know I gave copies to 
the Court, but I have additional copies. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, I 
believe there is no objection from either 
of the parties. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you so much. 
Let's 
go ahead and mark these as Defendant's 
Exhibits No. 1 and 2 for identification 
purposes. 
Anybody object to me taking 
judicial notice of Judge Marra's order? 
By 
hearing no objection, I'll go ahead and 
take judicial notice of it. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
So, your Honor, 
Judge Marra has dealt with this issue 
squarely, there's a procedure in place and

these matters should be litigated in front 
of the district court judge that has

THE COURT: 
Well, let's say that may 
be true as it relates to these individual 
plaintiffs in the federal litigation, what 
about the Post's and the press's -- the 
media's right to take a look at these 
things? 
16 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, and this 
is the second reason why not only the 
plaintiffs but the Post appear to be 
marching up the wrong hill here. 
The Palm 
Beach Post has filed a motion for access to 
these documents and they certainly do have 
first amendment rights and no one would 
dispute that they have first amendment 
rights to access to public records, 
however, most significantly in this case is 
that the nonprosecution agreement which we 
gave the court permission to review two 
weeks ago and presumably the Court has had 
an opportunity to take a look at it, the 
nonprosecution agreement talks about and 
relates to a grand jury matter that is

Procedure Six is a rule that deals with 
grand jury proceedings, and it confers in

the federal system secrecy of all grand 
jury matters and it's pretty clear in this 
case that the nonprosecution agreement 
specifically talks about a grand jury 
investigation of Mr. Epstein, there's 
specific reference to a grand jury 
investigation in the nonprosecution 
agreement. 
18 
The rule does not prevent us from 
telling the Court that there was a grand 
jury investigation of Mr. Epstein, but what 
it prevents us from doing, what it prevents 
this Court from doing, I believe, is 
disclosing the content of the grand jury 
investigation, and the agreement itself is 
very specific as to the grand jury 
investigation of Mr. Epstein. 
However, all is not lost for the Palm 
Beach Post and the intervenors, for that 
matter. 
The rule has a specific procedure 
that allows you to go to the district court 
where the grand jury is convened, in this 
case it would be in the Southern District 
of Florida before Judge Marra and that is 
under Rule 6E, your Honor, I think it's 6E

It says: 
In limited 
circumstances the Court may authorize 
disclosure of grand jury matters under 
request made in connection with the 
judicial proceeding, so -- and the rule 
19 
goes onto clearly say, that request must be 
filed in the district where the grand jury 
is proceeding. 
So the first -- you know the Palm 
Beach Post may have first amendment rights 
to access but those first amendment rights 
cannot circumvent the federally protected 
secrecy of grand jury proceedings and 
that's what the Post is doing by making 
this request before this Court. 
This matter has been sealed for 
almost a year now, 11 months and some days 
and the Palm Beach Post has not filed 
anything in this matter until most 
recently, and their remedy is to go into 
the federal court and invoke the process of 
Rule Six and asked Judge Marra to make a 
limited disclosure of the nonprosecution 
agreement and the grand jury matters that 
are contained therein. 
Who knows whether

he will do it, but that's where this battle 
need to be fought. 
As a matter of comity, your Honor, 
this Court should defer to Judge Marra 
because, A, he has already ruled on the 
disclosure of the nonpros agreement, but 
even more importantly, the supremacy clause 
requires you to defer to the federal laws 
of criminal procedure that say these 
matters should be protected and should not 
be disclosed unless the district court says 
so. 
If the Court is going to go on and 
wants to go to the issues that would be 
contained if it were not dealing with a 
grand jury proceeding, obviously there's a 
test that the Court must then use under the 
Rules of Judicial Administration and it 
says matters can be sealed but they should 
be sealed if there's a compelling 
government interest or if the sealing is 
important to the administration of justice. 
There's a couple other criteria, but the 
ones obviously that would apply in this 
case are the compelling government

MR. EDWARDS: 
Your Honor, inasmuch as 
Mr. Epstein is relying on Judge Marra's 
order to support the argument that the 
nonprosecution agreement needs to remain 
sealed, I'd like to address that if you are 
inclined to be persuaded by that argument 
at all. 
The orders that have now been moved 
into evidence are in case No. 80736, and

actuality, the order says -- specifically 
puts it back on this Court and confers 
authority on this Court over this 
particular document, when in the second 
22 
page of the February 12th, 2009 order, it's 
misdated 2009 but it's a 2009 order, and 
the last two sentences read: 
If and when 
petitioners have a specific tangible need 
to be relieved of the restrictions, they 
should file an appropriate motion, which we 
believe we have done in this case, if a 
specific tangle need arises in the civil 
cases, which are in circuit court in Palm 
Beach County, then relief should be sought 
there and notice to all parties, so to give 
the Court context for that order, there was 
a state court plea taken June 30th, 2008, 
where Mr. Epstein pled guilty to the state 
court cases as it related to two victims. 
Now, parallel to that, there was an 
investigation in federal court where the 
United States attorney's office and the FBI 
had more than 30 victims of sex abuse of 
Mr. Epstein's and they were working with 
these girls and their cases. 
Now, several

of those girls came to me and said, hey, 
we're worried that there's a secret deal 
going on between Epstein and the U.S. 
attorney's office, so I filed an emergency 
petition against the U.S. attorney's office 
asking the federal court to intervene and 
get in the middle of this and not let this 
deal go forward without meaningfully 
conferring with these girls because I was 
alleging it violated the Crimes Victim's 
Rights Act; these girls have a right to be 
heard. 
That emergency motion was filed 
July 7th, 2008, and I have that for the 
Court, and I'd like to enter that into 
evidence as well. 
THE COURT: 
We'll mark that as -
Exhibit No. 1. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
And an emergency 
hearing was held four days later in front 
of Judge Marra, who was randomly assigned 
to this case at the time the plea was taken 
and the prosecution agreement was sealed. 
Judge Marra had nothing to do with the 
agreement, with Epstein, he didn't know 
anything about it.

So four days later now we're in front 
of him and the United States attorney's 
office says for the first time, sorry, 
girls, you are too late, the deal has 
already been done as to all of your federal 
cases and it resulted in the nonprosecution 
agreement that is attached in the state 
court case. 
Judge Marra turned to us and 
said, what is your remedy. 
At that point in time I said we don't 
know because we don't know what protections 
are inside that agreement, so we want you 
to unseal it, that's where the motion for 
protective order came about where he gave 
us the agreement so we can look at it and 
determine what remedy, if any, was 
available. 
Once we had that agreement 
under the caveat that we were not able to 
disseminate to third parties and reviewed 
it and saw there is very little protection 
for the girls, we asked to unseal it 
completely, so that we can talk to third 
parties, to victim's rights groups and get 
some insight as to what our possible remedy 
would be.

And so our reason for wanting him to 
unseal it at that time was we want to be 
able to talk to other people, and that's 
where this order from February 12th, 2009, 
came in, and he denied that motion to 
unseal it for three reasons. 
First and foremost, this 
nonprosecution agreement was not sealed in 
my Court, you are talking to the wrong 
judge, you need to go back, so we're 
getting the back and forth here and it's 
not in my court, I can't mess with some 
other judge's order. 
Obviously, there was 
a hearing held and that document was sealed 
for a reason, I'm not privy for those 
reasons, so I'm not going to override 
whatever that judge was thinking when they 
sealed that document. 
Second, your reason is you just want 
to talk to other people about them, and if 
I'm going to override some other judge's 
order, I need to have a more compelling 
reason than you just want to talk to people 
about. 
Third, if and when a specific need

arises in any of the civil cases, which by 
the time this order was coming about they 
were stacking up in state and federal court 
against Mr. Epstein, petition that court, 
petition the appropriate court, and he 
implies that appropriate court is this 
court where it was initially sealed, which 
we've done in this case. 
This court has none of the problems 
that Judge Marra had in that it was sealed 
in this courtroom. 
We have noticed 
Mr. Epstein to be heard at this hearing, 
which is one of the requirements that 
Judge Marra placed on us, and a specific 
need has arisen. 
It has been sealed for 
over a year now, correct, Mr. Goldberger is 
correct, but the specific need is arising 
because we are in the middle of discovery. 
And this document is, as Mr. Goldberger 
said, a great inducement to Mr. Epstein 
pleaing guilty to sex crimes in state 
court, and to ultimately being labeled a 
sex offender, and the only document that 
pertains to my clients, my client as a 
victim of Mr. Epstein's sex crime, so at

Mr. Goldberger about the girls are able to

make any sense because if it is a state

jurisdiction to rule on a state court 
document.

good faith believe that on the contents of 
that document speak to the issues of 
whether or not he can or cannot deny the 
claims that have been brought against him 
both in state and federal court. 
In other 
words, whether or not he must, in fact, 
admit that he molested these 14 year old 
girls, so, therefore, the content of that 
document is paramount as to the issues in 
the civil proceedings that are currently

the convoluted situation that brings us to 
the courtroom. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Just this whole 
federal state situation. 
There is no hill 
31 
for the public and the press to march up in 
Judge Marra's court as Mr. Edwards pointed 
out, Judge Marra has specifically held the 
agreement was not filed in this case under 
seal or otherwise, so were I to march into 
Judge Marra's courtroom and do my whole 
public access spiel, he would say take it 
to you, your Honor, because it's not a 
record in my court. 
It is a record here, 
and in the state court as we talked about 
the last time, we were here, there's a 
presumption of openness. 
The burden is on 
Mr. Epstein to overcome that presumption. 
While he filed a very brief memorandum 
after our last hearing, which identified 
for interest, he has by no means met the 
test of either establishing those interest 
or establishing the remainder of that test 
which would be that closures no broader 
than necessary ineffective no other 
reasonable alternatives, so if I could, I'd

like to sort of focus us back to the 
inquiry we're here to make today in this 
court, and that is whether your Honor is 
going to provide public access to two 
records that are, I think, indisputably in 
your Honor's court file in this court's 
file. 
It's a plea agreement and an 
addendum; those are historically and 
typically open records. 
Mr. Goldberger mentioned that the 
plea agreement was sort of incidentally 
filed in this court file, and that it was 
sort of an afterthought that happened. 
He 
never came into court intending that it 
even be part of the court file, but 
Judge Pucillo specifically said, this is a 
significant inducement to accepting the 
plea in my court. 
This agreement that you 
have with federal prosecutors is 
significantly the reason why you're 
32 
entering this plea before me. 
And she took 
those records into the court file 
presumably because they are significant to 
this litigation. 
Even if there was an

incidental filing, which cannot possibly be 
the case here, there is no mechanism in 
Florida law to call a Mulligan and to pull 
it out of the court file. 
As you know, the 
Floridians have a constitutional right of 
access, there's no mechanism in that law to 
just say, oopsy, let's take it out of the 
file, so they have to meet their burden and 
they have to show under Rule 2.420 that one 
of those interests is satisfied. 
They have 
identified four here. 
I have not heard 
them discuss them at any great length. 
But 
I will go through them quickly. 
The imminent threat to the fair, 
impartial orderly administration of 
justice, or to protect a compelling 
government interest. 
As your Honor is 
aware, the federal government is not here 
today. 
I have spoken with the state 
attorney's office who has indicated that 
their only interest is in protecting to the 
extent necessary because I've not seen 
these documents the identity of the victims 
of these crimes.

has already set forth that we have no 
objection to redacting the victim's names 
if, in fact, that is required because we 
haven't seen the agreement. 
To avoid 
substantial injury to innocent third 
parties, again, absolutely no showing on 
34 
that test. 
I have no burden at this point, 
but I will simply state that the law in 
Florida is clear that Mr. Epstein doesn't 
have standing to assert that interest. 
And, finally, something else I heard 
nothing about to avoid substantial injury 
to a party which, I guess, presumably would 
be Mr. Epstein by disclosure of matters 
protected by a privacy right not generally 
inherent in this specific type of 
proceedings. 
Again, I have not heard any 
attempt to meet the burden on that issue, 
however, Florida law is equally clear that 
participants in crimes lose their privacy 
interest in the matters and facts and 
circumstances of the commission of those 
crimes, so Mr. Epstein surely cannot

prosecution regarding the molestation of

The circumstances under which closure 
is allowed in Florida are exceedingly 
narrow. 
We first -- and before we do 
anything else -- have to find that one of 
those interests is met here, that it exists 
and that the movant has met its burden in 
demonstrating that it's significant enough 
to require the court to consider closure. 
That's not the end of inquiry. 
And, of 
course, I have not yet heard anything else 
about that second half of the test which 
talks about the idea that closure is no 
broader than necessary to protect that 
interest and that it would be effective and 
that there are no other alternatives. 
In speaking of the federal litigation 
there are instances when both Mr. Epstein's 
lawyers and the federal prosecutors have 
placed portions of the agreement into the 
public court file. 
There are -- thus 
attempts to seal those records in the 
federal litigation have been unsuccessful, 
so part of this agreement the cat is

already out of the bag. 
But there is also 
an enormous public interest in what's going 
on here, apart from the idea that this man 
is accused of having many, many victims who 
were all young children which, of course, 
in itself creates a lot of public concern, 
the chief of police at the time sent a 
letter to the state prosecutors and said, 
what are you guys doing, how are you 
handling this, this is highly unusual; I 
don't like what I'm seeing here. 
And even 
went so far as to say, state attorney's 
office, should you all step away from this 
case. 
So we have public interest from the 
perspective of the police chief questioning 
the state attorney's office about whether 
it's doing its job. 
We have public 
interest that's spurned by the idea that 
some of the victims in the federal 
prosecution -- in the federal court claimed 
they weren't aware of it, we just heard 
Mr. Edwards talk about the fact that his 
clients weren't aware of the agreement 
unless it all went down, so we have a

significant public interest about how 
everybody in this litigation is doing their 
job. 
There is nothing more fundamentally 
important than the ability of the public 
and the press to observe how its 
government, all branches of its government, 
do its job. 
There are multiple, as Mr. Edwards 
also mentioned, multiple civil lawsuits 
that have spurned as a result of 
Mr. Epstein's conduct, and, again, the 
public has an interest in what's going on 
in civil litigation matters. 
In short, this matter involves a 
major public interest from a lot of 
different levels. 
There is no basis for 
closure that has been asserted here. 
It's 
a heavy burden to meet. 
We start with the 
idea that openness is the right thing to do 
but there is essentially no purpose served 
at this point by keeping these agreements 
sealed in this case. 
Unless your Honor has any questions, 
I think that's it.

Ms. Burns, on behalf of the state of 
Florida, anything you'd like to add or 
advocate?

Sure.

Good afternoon, your

evaluations. 
Number one, does the document, in 
fact, have a relationship to the criminal 
39 
case in the state matter. 
And, number two, 
evaluate the right of public access versus 
the victim's right to confidentiality. 
If 
this Court does decide to unseal those 
records, then the State would ask that this 
Court before making the document public 
access, then make certain that in place is 
that the victim's identities are amended to 
initials if their names are used. 
The State does have a concern 
regarding the argument of the Federal Rule 
Six in that is this Court bound by a 
federal rule which perhaps has been made 
unenforcible by virtue of making it a part 
of the state file, so I think the Court 
also would need to address that issue 
before making its ruling. 
THE COURT: 
All right, great. 
Thank 
you so much. 
MS. BURNS: 
Thank you, Judge.

I'll let rebuttal of any other 
presentation, Mr. Goldberger, or, 
Mr. Critton, you'd like to make. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Thank you, your 
Honor. 
As to the last argument made by 
Ms. Burns as to the applicability of 
Federal Rule 6 of the Rules of Federal 
Criminal Procedure it's something that we 
learned in the law school that the 
40 
supremacy clause controls and to the extent 
there's a conflict between the federal 
doctrine and the state doctrine, the 
supremacy clause requires the federal rule 
of law to apply and to control. 
And 
certainly in this case you cannot use a 
state procedure to circumvent a federal 
rule of criminal procedure that confers 
secrecy to a grand jury proceeding. 
And the Palm Beach Post response to 
the argument never made note of the grand 
jury rule, they simply avoided that issue 
and that in our mind is equally important 
as the fact in the interest of comity this 
Court should defer to the rulings of 
Judge Marra already.

As to Mr. Kuvin's argument that he 
has a client that is in state court and is 
not in federal court and therefore he 
doesn't have a remedy in federal court. 
With all due respect to Mr. Kuvin, that's 
similarly wrong. 
Judge Marra's order 
41 
specifically dealt with a class of 
individuals who were identified as victims 
of Mr. Epstein's conduct, and Judge Marra's 
order says that anyone who's been 
identified by the United States attorney's 
office as a victim has right to the 
nonprosecution agreement under the same 
rules. 
Just so the Court understands, I know 
we are talking like the Court understands 
everything about this case. 
There was a 
list of victims that was created at the 
time that the nonprosecution agreement was 
entered into and Mr. Kuvin's client is on 
that list. 
That list was created by the 
U.S. attorney's office. 
He has the same 
rights to the nonprosecution agreement as 
if he filed this case in federal court and 
he knows that we've told him that he has

that access. 
As to the fact that the 
nonprosecution agreement is presumably not 
filed in the federal case in our last 
hearing in front of Judge Marra on June 5th 
-- I'm sorry, June 12th, Mr. Edwards 
advised Judge Marra that he had, in fact, 
filed a nonprosecution agreement to no 
one's surprise under seal in the federal 
file, so the nonprosecution agreement 
according to Mr. Edwards' declaration at 
that hearing is contained in the federal 
court system. 
For all of those reasons, your Honor, 
and the reasons that I previously indicated 
to the Court, we would ask the Court to 
defer to the federal court in this matter. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Thank you very 
much. 
Here is what I'm planning on doing, 
so you know where I'm going on this. 
I'll 
make an oral announcement and I'll follow 
it up with a written order so that you all 
can have something to take to wherever you 
want to take it.

I'll grant the motion to 
unseal them. 
I will take a look at the 
documents. 
I will redact out of them 
the -- what I'll do is, I'll leave the 
originals intact sealed in the court file 
to protect the names of any underage 
victims. 
I will make copies of those. 
I'll 
redact out the names leaving -- expose the 
initials of any of the individuals. 
I'll 
get that done -- I'll get my written order 
out granting and denying the respective 
motions hopefully by the end of today.

not today, tomorrow.

the redacted versions probably Monday, so 
that those will be available for public

Just very briefly, 
the Court is going to look at the

redacting, I believe. 
I just need to 
advise the court in addition to Mr. Epstein 
and perhaps victims mention the 
nonprosecution agreement, there are third 
parties who the Court needs to look about 
redacting their names also, and that's 
contained in the nonprosecution agreement. 
In other words, there are other 
people beside Mr. Epstein and Mr. Victims 
whose names are mentioned in the 
nonprosecution agreement, and I would ask 
the Court to look at those names also for 
the purpose of redacting. 
THE COURT: 
I'll like a look.
