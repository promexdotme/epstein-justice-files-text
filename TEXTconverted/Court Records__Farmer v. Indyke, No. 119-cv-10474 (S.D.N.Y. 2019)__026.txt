Decedent, any recovery obtained by Plaintiff against the Co-Executors should be reduced in 
proportion to the respective negligence and fault and legal responsibility of all such other persons 
and entities, and their agents, servants and employees who contributed to or caused any such injury 
or damages, in accordance with the law of comparative negligence; the liability of the Co-
Executors, if any, is limited in direct proportion to the percentage of fault actually attributed to 
Decedent. 
6.
Statute of Limitations. The Complaint, and each and every cause of action 
contained therein, is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, including without limitation 
because: (i) the New York Child Victims’ Act, including without limitation CPLR 214-g, violates 
the New York Constitution and the U.S. Constitution; (ii) CPLR § 215(8)(a) is inapplicable to this 
action; (iii) the doctrines of equitable tolling and estoppel are unavailable to Plaintiff and otherwise 
inapplicable to this action; and (iv) Decedent’s alleged conduct did not constitute an offense under 
New York Penal Law § 130, including without limitation because such alleged conduct occurred 
outside of New York.   
7.
Intervening/Superseding Causes. To the extent the injuries and damages which 
Plaintiff alleges were proximately caused by, or contributed to by, the acts of persons or entities 
other than Decedent, and said acts were intervening or superseding causes of the injuries and 
damages, if any, which Plaintiff alleges, Plaintiff is barred from any recovery against the Co-
Executors.  
8.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the doctrines of waiver, estoppel and laches. 
9.
To the extent Plaintiff seeks damages that are punitive in nature, they are barred 
including without limitation pursuant to N.Y. E.P.T.L. § 11-3.2.

of St. Thomas and St. John. 
The Co-Executors have not knowingly or intentionally waived any applicable affirmative 
defenses and reserve the right to assert and rely upon such affirmative defenses as may become 
available or apparent during discovery. The Co-Executors further reserve the right to amend their 
Answer accordingly.
