MS. 
Ladies and gentlemen, let me just give 
you a brief instruction. Some of the testimony that you'll 
hear today will include what's called hearsay. As you know, 
that means that the witness will not be testifying solely 
from her own observations, but that she'll also be reporting 
to you what others have told her and what she's read in 
reports and documents prepared by other people. 
Hearsay evidence is admissible in these grand jury 
proceedings, and you're free to rely on it in determining 
whether there's probable cause to indict the proposed 
defendant. 
If, however, you would like to hear the testimony 
of any other witness, you have the right to request it and 
we will make reasonable efforts to bring that witness before 
you. 
BY MS.

A. 
Yes, it did. 
Q. 
And during those years, did she regularly go over 
to Epstein's house in Palm Beach and spend time with Maxwell 
and Epstein? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
What happened in the summer of 1997 when 
was 17 and about to turn 18? 
A. 
She moved to New York City. 
Q. 
Why did she move to New York City? 
A. 
She wanted to pursue a career in acting and 
modeling. 
Q. 
We'll talk about that in a moment, but for now I 
want to focus on the years you talked about in Palm Beach 
from ages 14 to 17 when 
would regularly go to 
Epstein's house. In the beginning, in the first few months 
when she went there, what kinds of things did she do when 
she would visit the house when Maxwell and Epstein were 
there? 
A. 
They'd hang out by the pool, he -- they would take 
her to the movies, take her shopping. She described the 
behavior as grooming. 
Q. 
When you say grooming, did she explain what sh,

meant by that? 
A. 
She meant that they were building a relationship 
with her, giving her things, taking her places. And then 
usually when the grooming happens, an offender will -- once 
they gain that trust, they will make the relationship turn 
sexual. 
Q. 
Now, you testified just a moment ago that 
described to you that she felt at this time period that they 
were grooming her. Is that right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Is that something that she realized at the time 
when she was 14, or is that something that she's described 
to you now? 
A. 
Something she's described now. She didn't realize 
that at the time. 
Q. 
So we'll talk a little bit more about grooming in 
a moment, but just to give context are you familiar with the 
term grooming based on your experience investigating crimes 
involving a sexual exploitation of minors? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Generally speaking, -- you were touching on this a 
moment ago, but if you just could explain in full. What is 
grooming? 
A. 
Grooming is when someone builds a relationship 
with a child. They find a vulnerability or a need and then.

they work on gaining a child's trust, and then oftentime 
gaining a parent's trust. Once they have that trust, they 
show that in ways that they care about them by giving them 
gifts and promises. And then once that's established, they 
then turn the relationship sexual, oftentimes making sexual 
comments and normalizing the behavior. 
4. 
Now, during these visits that you've been 
describing that 
told you about, did 
say whether 
Epstein ever gave her anything? 
A. 
Yes, she did. 
Q. 
What did he give her? 
A. 
He gave her cash. Sometimes he'd tell her to give 
the cash to her mom because he knew that they needed it. He 
paid for her voice lessons as well. 
Q. 
Now, you were describing how 
has 
characterized these visits now. But based on your 
conversations with her, at the time did she feel that these 
visits were strange at all? 
A. 
She thought they were strange, but Maxwell 
normalized it for her. She was like a cool older sister and 
made comments like this is what grownups do. 
Q. 
You used the phrase cool older sister. Is that a 
phrase that 
used to describe how she felt about 
Maxwell at the time and what Maxwell was like? 
A. 
Yes, those are her words.

She was a little taken back, but Maxwell just

Did 
tell you about an incident several 
months into this arrangement when she was alone with Epstein 
in the pool house?

Yes. 
Q. 
And when they were alone together, did Epstein ask 
what she wanted to do with her life? 
A. 
He did. 
Q. 
What did she say? 
A. 
She said she wanted to be an actress and a model. 
Q. 
How did Epstein respond? 
A. 
He told her that he was best friends with the 
owner of Victoria Secret. Told her that she would have to 
have photographs taken and that she got to be comfortable in 
her underwear, and not to be a prude. When she asked what 
that meant, he pulled her to his lap and masturbated. 
Q. 
What was her reaction? 
A. 
She felt paralyzed. She froze. 
Q. 
After this incident, did 
encounters with 
Epstein begin to include sexual contact?

Q. 
Generally speaking, in broad strokes, what was the 
lawsuit about? What was the claim that 
was bringing 
against Maxwell? 
A. 
had stated that she had been sexually 
abused by Epstein and Maxwell as a minor. Maxwell came 
forward publically and called her a liar. So 
her for defamation. 
MS. 
So just a small legal instruction on 
this topic. Ladies and gentleman, I instruct you that the 
allegations in the lawsuit are not being presented to you as 
evidence that those incidents occurred. I instruct you that 
you should not consider those allegations for their truth; 
instead, the circumstances of the lawsuit are being 
presented to you so that you can consider the context of the 
case and the circumstances under which Maxwell made 
statements under oath. 
BY MS. 
Q. 
Turning back to the deposition. Did Maxwell's 
deposition take place over two different days? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
On both days did she give testimony in Manhattan? 
A. 
Yes, she did. 
Q. 
Is that where the deposition took place? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And on both days was Maxwell sworn under oath?
