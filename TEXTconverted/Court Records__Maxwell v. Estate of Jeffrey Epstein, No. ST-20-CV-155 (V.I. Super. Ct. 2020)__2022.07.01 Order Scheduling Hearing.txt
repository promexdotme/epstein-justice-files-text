CASE NO. ST-2020-CV-00155 
Complex Litigation Division 
Action for Indemnification 
ORDER 
THIS MATTER is before the undersigned following a review of the file. 
The parties appeared before the Judge for a status conference on March 9, 2022. 
According to the record of the clerk, the Judge directed the parties to submit briefs on 
or before August 1, 2022, on whether Virgin Islands public policy barred one or more 
of Plaintiff Ghislaine Maxwell's claims. The undersigned, having attended the hearing, 
recalls that Plaintiff's counsel had also requested a longer period of time to file the 
briefs in light of the then-pending criminal case in the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York. No date was given for another status conference, 
however. 
In furtherance of the undersigned's duty to oversee the management of the 
complex litigation cases, and to hold case management and scheduling conferences in 
complex litigation cases, 
, Admin Order No. 2021-0012 
(V.I. Aug. 12, 2021), available at 2021 V.I. Supreme LEXIS 4 / 2021 WL 3562551, it is 
hereby ORDERED that this matter is scheduled for a remote Status Conference on 
Friday, July 29, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., call-in details to be provided in advance by email.
