Re: US v. Epstein, 19 CR 490 (SDNY) 
 
 
Dear Judge Berman: 
 
 
In response to requests from the Court and certain arguments made 
yesterday by the government, we write to supplement Jeffrey Epstein’s 
request for bail.   
 
First, make no mistake about the crux of the government’s 
detention argument and its necessary implications. Stripped to its core, 
the government’s position – as urged in its letters and echoed again 
yesterday – distills to this: the nominally rebuttable remand 
presumption (connected with 18 USC § 1591 charges) 1  plus Mr. 
                                                 
1 To be clear, Epstein contends that § 1591 and the concomitant remand presumption 
do not contemplate or cover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual

Epstein’s wealth creates an irrebuttable presumption whereby no 
condition(s) can reasonably assure personal appearance or protect the 
public. The Court should reject the government’s misguided effort to 
effectively create a per se rule.2 Indeed, for the government, there’s 
literally nothing a person of Epstein’s means could say, do or pledge to 
rebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for release. 
 
That cannot be the law. Such a construction turns the statute’s 
                                                 
massages for money. See Fierro v. Taylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL 13042630, at *3 
(SDNY July 2, 2012) (holding that sex purchasers from minors fall outside § 1591’s 
ambit). 
 
2 E.g., 7/15/19 Tr. 11 (“even if the defense were able at some point to rebut the 
presumption by providing some more information, there simply is no way that they 
can meet the standard here”); 7/12/19 Ltr. 5 (“even assuming the defendant’s assets 
are presently in the United States, nothing … would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or 
relocation. The defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades 
of experience in the industry and significant ties to financial institutions and actors 
around the world. He could easily transfer funds and holdings on a moment’s [notice] 
to places where the [g]overnment would never find them so as to ensure he could live 
comfortably while a fugitive.”); id. (“even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all 
of his current assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to 
resume making … tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States…. 
[T]here would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown 
assets abroad, and then continuing to … earn his vast wealth from a computer 
terminal beyond the reach of extradition.”) (footnote omitted); id. 7 (“the notion that 
any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for this defendant strains 
credulity”).

plain text – expressly providing that the presumption is “[s]ubject to 
rebuttal,” and otherwise mandating bail on the “least restrictive” 
conditions that reasonably assure the defendant’s presence and 
community safety – on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the 
presumption of innocence. And it violates the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
amendment rights to due process, counsel, a defense and equal 
protection, not to mention the Eighth Amendment guarantee of bail – all 
based on a suspect if not invidious classification. To be sure, wealthy 
defendants do not deserve preferential treatment. But they certainly 
shouldn’t be singled out for worse treatment – in effect, categorically 
disqualified from bail, at least in a presumption case – on the basis of 
their net worth. 
 
Second, it bears emphasis that the presumption is hardly an 
insurmountable bar to release in a § 1591 prosecution.3  To the contrary, 
courts have determined that there are suitable conditions under which 
                                                 
3 E.g., US v. Brinson, No. 13-CR-04-GKF, 2013 WL 11305792 (N.D. Okla. Feb. 8, 
2013); US v. Afyare, No. 3:10-cr-00260, 2011 WL 1397820 (M.D. Tenn. April 13, 2011); 
US v. Gardner, 523 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2007).

defendants accused of trafficking minors are bailed – notwithstanding 
the remand presumption. 
 
Third, as apparent from Mr. Epstein’s initial financial disclosure, 
Mr. Epstein’s finances are fairly complex. It would be impossible for Mr. 
Epstein – given, among other impediments, his detention, inability to 
quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise 
valuation of particular assets – to provide a sufficient financial statement 
by the Court’s 5pm deadline. Mr. Epstein certainly recognizes the Court’s 
request for further transparency and is committed to providing a 
complete and accurate disclosure. Accordingly, we propose that the Court 
preliminarily accept the initial disclosure proffered last Friday and, if 
intending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Mr. Epstein 
to tender a comprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as 
expeditiously as practicable. Joel Podgor, Partner Emeritus at prominent 
Manhattan accounting firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, has 
agreed to conduct the forensic investigation and prepare a report rapidly. 
As counsel said during the July 15 argument, Epstein will agree to any

monetary condition – consistent with his Sixth Amendment need to 
retain counsel and pay ordinary expenses, which, at the Court’s 
discretion, could be subject to supervision by a Court-appointed trustee – 
that collateralizes his assets as a condition of release. 
 
Fourth, to the extent the government complains Epstein lacks 
meaningful domestic ties, we clarify and emphasize that his brother 
Mark, a U.S. resident, stands prepared to co-sign and secure a release 
bond in the full amount of his “own net worth,”4 which exceeds $100 
million – tangible proof of his certainty that Epstein will appear as 
necessary. 
 
Fifth, in response to the Court’s inquiry about Epstein’s New 
Mexico registration status, the state’s Public Safety Department formally 
advised in August 2010 that “you are not required to register with the 
State of New Mexico … for your 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring 
Person Under 18 for Prostitution.” Nonetheless, in an abundance of 
caution and as an extra precaution, Epstein consistently notified the 
                                                 
4 7/12/19 Ltr. 6 (footnote omitted).

appropriate New Mexico official, Detective Deborah Anaya, when he 
spent any time at his ranch there. (The underlying documents are 
available upon request.) 
 
Sixth, though some studies may well indicate that sex offender 
recidivism rates “actually go[] up at 15 years,” as Your Honor suggested 
from the bench,5 others reach the opposite conclusion. For example, a 
respected study found that the relapse risk drops substantially the longer 
a person remains sex-offense free in the community. 6  Another 
determined that it’s mistaken to think of anyone who’s been offense-free 
for 15 years as high-risk.7  
 
Seventh, to the extent third-party counsel (Mr. Boies) speculated 
that the alleged November 28 and December 3, 2018 payments8 were

made to “witnesses who were cooperating with us”9 in civil litigation, he  
is wrong. As explained in Court, the recipients were “long-time [Epstein] 
friends and employees” 10  – not putative victims – and they never 
cooperated with Mr. Boies. To the contrary, each invoked the Fifth 
Amendment and refused to testify when civilly deposed, respectively, in 
prior New York federal and Florida state civil proceedings. Subject to the 
protective orders in these proceedings, we would be pleased to provide 
relevant deposition transcripts.   
 
Eighth, as for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it 
expired 32 years ago. And the government offers nothing to suggest – and 
certainly no evidence – that Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein – 
an affluent member of the Jewish faith – acquired the passport in the 
1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East 
travel. The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to 
dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, hijackers

or terrorists should violent episodes occur.  
 
Ninth, the Court is undoubtedly aware of the highly charged 
context surrounding this prosecution. In November 2018, media reports 
suggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a “slap on 
the wrist.” Putting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-
prosecution agreement (NPA) and the prison sentence that Epstein 
completed, there can be no dispute that certain witnesses through their 
attorney representatives,11 the media – e.g., The Miami Herald – and 
the public were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled 
extensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the 
United States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won’t flee 
and entitles him to release – on any and all conditions the Court deems 
appropriate.
