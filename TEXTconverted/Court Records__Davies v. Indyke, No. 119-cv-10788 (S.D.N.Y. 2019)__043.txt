PROCEEDINGS

HONORABLE DEBRA C. FREEMAN (THE COURT):   All 
2 
right, so this is Judge Freeman.  And if I've got this 
3 
calendared right, this should be a conference in three of 
4 
the cases involving the Jeffrey Epstein Estate:  Jane Doe 
5 
v. Indyke, 19-cv-10653; Mary Doe v. Indyke, 19-cv-10758; 
6 
and Davies v. Indyke, 19-cv-10788. 
7 
Anybody have a different understanding as to why 
8 
you're here? 
9 
(No response.) 
10 
THE COURT:  No.  Can I have your appearances, 
11 
starting with the first of the cases that I listed, the 
12 
Jane Doe case? 
13 
MS. MARIANN M. WANG:  So for plaintiffs, Mariann 
14 
Wang.  And I believe my colleague, Dan Mullkoff, is on the 
15 
line.  And we represent the plaintiffs in all three cases, 
16 
so -- (Stopped talking.) 
17 
THE COURT:  Okay.  And on defendants' side? 
18 
MR. BENNET J. MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, your Honor.  
19 
Bennet Moskowitz, Troutman Sanders, for the co-executors.  And 
20 
on the line should be my colleagues, Matthew Aaronson, Valerie 
21 
Sirota, and Molly DiRago.  And that's true for all three of 
22 
the actions. 
23 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So that would count for 1, 2, 3, 
24 
4, 5, 6 people.  Is my law clerk on? 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
5 
MS. HANNAH MARTIN:  Yes, Judge, I'm here. 
2 
THE COURT:  Okay, that's Hannah Martin.  She's one 
3 
of my clerks.  There should be still more people on, based on 
4 
what I heard when I joined the call.  Is there anyone else on 
5 
the call? 
6 
MS. EMILY FALL:  Hi.  My name is Emily Fall; I'm a 
7 
reporter with 3M Canny 4 Productions.  I'm also on the call. 
8 
THE COURT:  Okay, is there anyone else on? 
9 
MR. JAMES HILL:  Your Honor, this is James Hill.  
10 
I'm a reporter with ABC News, and I am monitoring the call and 
11 
will keep my line on mute. 
12 
THE COURT:  Okay.  I've slightly lost count.  If 
13 
there's anyone else on the call from the public or press, you 
14 
are, of course, welcome to listen in.  I would appreciate it 
15 
if you would keep your phones on mute, which you seem to have 
16 
been doing until I asked who was here.   
17 
Do we have a court reporter?  I know that in one of 
18 
the conferences scheduled today -- it may have been the one 
19 
that's at 11 o'clock -- there was a request to have a court 
20 
reporter.  No?   
21 
All right.  So the conference is being recorded 
22 
through the AT & T conference system.  And if anyone wants a 
23 
transcript, you can get it through us through that system.  
24 
Because someone may be trying to transcribe it from an audio 
25

recording, if you do speak, please state your name before you 
2 
speak so someone can keep the voices straight and be able to 
3 
make a transcript that makes sense if there should be a need. 
4 
All right, so what I thought I would do, rather than 
5 
have a conference in all of the cases that I have in front of 
6 
me for supervision, I thought I would take them in clusters 
7 
where issues had arisen.  In each of these three cases there 
8 
was a consent letter filed for an extension of time.  And even 
9 
though it was on consent, I thought I would hear from you as 
10 
to this concept of an informal stay and just what was 
11 
happening.  And I don't mind a 30-day extension of deadlines, 
12 
but I wanted to get a sense of where things were with respect 
13 
to potential settlement.  And, you know, I read in the news as 
14 
much as anyone else, but that doesn't really tell me the full 
15 
story.  So can I just hear from plaintiffs' counsel about 
16 
general status here? 
17 
MS. WANG:  Sure, your Honor.  This is Mariann Wang 
18 
again.  So we have made some progress in terms of the 
19 
litigation; that is, we've exchanged discovery responses, 
20 
interrogatory responses -- 
21 
THE COURT:  Hold on a second.  Did someone join the 
22 
call?  No?  I want to make sure -- 
23 
MS. LAURA MENNINGER:  Hi.  I'm just -- I'm listening 
24 
in, your Honor.  It's counsel for another party. 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 6 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
7 
THE COURT:  Oh, that's fine.  Okay. 
2 
MS. WANG:  Can I just ask counsel for which party?  
3 
Just to know. 
4 
MS. MENNINGER:  Oh, I'm sorry. 
5 
THE COURT:  Are you counsel in another case that's 
6 
pending in front of me? 
7 
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.  I have a hearing 
8 
in front of you at nine o'clock AM.  This is Laura Menninger 
9 
for Ms. Maxwell. 
10 
THE COURT:  At nine o'clock?  You must mean 11 
11 
o'clock New York time? 
12 
MS. MENNINGER:  Oh, I'm sorry, yes.  I'm in 
13 
Colorado.  Yeah, 11 o'clock Eastern time.  Thank you. 
14 
THE COURT:  Okay.  You're welcome. 
15 
All right, you were saying, counsel? 
16 
MS. WANG:  Sure.  So, again, Mariann Wang for 
17 
plaintiffs.  So we have made some progress.  We're also -- 
18 
we were kind of on the cusp of about to exchange a lot of 
19 
paper discovery and starting to talk about depositions.  
20 
And so there was progress being made on the litigation 
21 
side.  At the same time that aspect of litigation was 
22 
not -- was hindered a bit because of the pandemic, just in 
23 
terms of communications and timeliness and ease of 
24 
gathering things because of, obviously, not being able to 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
8 
meet in person with the clients.  We had also started to 
2 
have some essentially, I guess, one would say some 
3 
conflicts potentially with defense counsel about whether 
4 
and how depositions can proceed, in person or remotely. 
5 
In any event, because of the kind of -- the 
6 
combination of perfect storm of both the hindrance of the 
7 
pandemic and logistics -- should I stop? 
8 
THE COURT:  Yes.  Did someone just join the call? 
9 
MALE:  Yes.  Inner City Press.  Not a participant. 
10 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Fine.  If you could keep your 
11 
phone on mute, I would appreciate that. 
12 
MALE:  I will.  Thanks. 
13 
THE COURT:  Go ahead, Ms. Wang. 
14 
MS. WANG:  Again, Ms. Mariann Wang.  And, at the 
15 
same time, our understanding that in the Virgin Islands 
16 
there seems to be potential progress and potentially in the 
17 
short term a possibility, really, of getting the claims 
18 
resolution process started.  We just felt that it might 
19 
make sense to put a pause and see whether that would have 
20 
some, you know, traction and whether we could get going on 
21 
that before essentially, really, both working extremely 
22 
hard and potentially draining resources on the estate front 
23 
of, you know, having apparently four or five lawyers 
24 
working nonstop on fighting us to some degree.  It just 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 8 of 25

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
9 
seemed to make sense to hit pause for a little while.  So 
2 
that's the basic concept. 
3 
THE COURT:  I will say on defendants' side you 
4 
seem to have four attorneys on this call.  I hope you're 
5 
keeping costs under control under the circumstances. 
6 
So I gather what you want to do is you don't want 
7 
an extension of discovery; what you want to do is basically 
8 
have a hiatus of discovery and then put the same amount of 
9 
time back on the clock as you had before?  You want to stop 
10 
everything for 30 days and have another 30 days thereafter 
11 
to finish discovery if you need it? 
12 
MS. WANG:  That was the idea, yes, your Honor. 
13 
THE COURT:  How much optimism do you have during 
14 
this 30-day period this process is going to get rolling and 
15 
you'll be able to enter into it and get these cases 
16 
resolved? 
17 
MS. WANG:  Well, this is where it is a little bit 
18 
trying to balance.  And I think that -- I mean, I have -- I 
19 
guess I probably would have more optimism -- I have 
20 
optimism that in 30 days we will know much more and we will 
21 
be able to then -- at least that's my hope -- be able to 
22 
really say okay, let's turn back to the litigation; or, 
23 
okay, let's really, you know, put this on hold/pause for 
24 
more amount of time because it looks like that's going.  
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 9 of 25

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
10 
That's my hope, at least.  Perhaps the estate would know 
2 
better, in fact, what -- you know, whether or not my 
3 
optimism is warranted. 
4 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, Bennet Moskowitz.  If 
5 
I may, I'm happy to provide an update about the Epstein 
6 
Victims Compensation Program. 
7 
THE COURT:  I'd appreciate it. 
8 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  And I'd first, since you've 
9 
raised it, like to address the issue of keeping costs -- 
10 
and I can assure your Honor that the sole reason the 
11 
attorneys are on who are on is because it is more efficient 
12 
in terms of managing all the 15 or so active cases for only 
13 
those who are on to be on rather than have lengthy back-
14 
and-forth follow-ups with each other.  And, in fact, we are 
15 
very concerned about litigation costs.  And the people 
16 
driving those costs have been various plaintiffs' firms.  I 
17 
will not necessarily pin that on Ms. Wang, as she is 
18 
actually trying to be reasonable here with the stay of some 
19 
sort, although -- which I'll get to -- we disagreed on how 
20 
to best do that. 
21 
But it bears mentioning the biggest drivers have 
22 
been the plaintiffs' firms, including making the estate 
23 
fight for months over whether they can get punitive 
24 
damages, which Judge Engelmayer in two cases ruled that no, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 10 of 25

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
11 
they can't; and as we've been saying all along, it's black 
2 
letter law.  And those are two of the cases on which we're 
3 
meeting for you now.  So I'm surprised to hear any comment 
4 
by plaintiffs' counsel attributing cost concerns to us.  
5 
The other culprit is the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney 
6 
general, which I'll get to. 
7 
But to get back to the program, we are confident 
8 
that the program will commence by June 15, at the latest.  
9 
To date, counsel for around 69 individual claimants have 
10 
come forward, including through the U.S.V.I. Probate Court, 
11 
in support of the program.  We believe that figure 
12 
constitutes the vast majority of claimants.  In fact, we 
13 
are only aware of one claimant through her counsel who has 
14 
stated that she does not intend to participate.  That's one 
15 
of the state court plaintiffs, not one of the cases before 
16 
your Honor.  And I don't even know if that's the current 
17 
position of that individual.   
18 
As your Honor is probably aware, we're now up to 
19 
seven Southern District of New York plaintiffs in three 
20 
lawsuits who have formally stayed their actions pending 
21 
their participation in the program, including most recently 
22 
Maria Farmer, whom Boies Schiller represents.  Ms. Wang's 
23 
three clients, of course, as they put it, sought this 
24 
informal stay, and they intend to participate in the 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 11 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
12 
program.  The program administrator and the designers have 
2 
nearly finalized the protocol for the program.  Recall 
3 
that's the nuts and bolts of how the program actually 
4 
works.  They've done that in close consultation with 
5 
claimants' counsel and with input from the co-executors. 
6 
So to recall, the only reason that the program did 
7 
not formally commence several months ago, which is what we 
8 
wanted, which would have avoided all these litigation 
9 
costs, is that in January 2020, the U.S. Virgin Islands 
10 
attorney general, who again does not represent a single 
11 
alleged victim, unilaterally imposed liens on the estate's 
12 
bank accounts in the Virgin Islands, freezing then-
13 
available funds for administration of the estate and 
14 
implementation of the program.  That caused a huge delay 
15 
solely attributable to the attorney general of the Virgin 
16 
Islands.   
17 
I am pleased to report that just a few days ago, 
18 
the estate and the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general 
19 
have reached a resolution in principle, which I understand 
20 
would involve the attorney general finally stepping aside 
21 
so the program can finally formally proceed.  There are a 
22 
few, I'd say, less contentious matters that still need to 
23 
be ironed out in that regard, but we expect that that 
24 
resolution would be finalized by next week and that we 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 12 of 25

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
13 
would notify the U.S.V.I. Probate Court about that sometime 
2 
next week.  If, however, something unexpected occurs, and 
3 
because the need for the program has grown increasingly 
4 
urgent, and with the overwhelming support of claimants' 
5 
counsel, the co-executors in any event intend to seek 
6 
commencement of the program on June 15, absent some 
7 
contrary direction from the U.S.V.I. Probate Court, which 
8 
we do not expect.   
9 
And, indeed, it bears mentioning that during the 
10 
February 4 hearing at the U.S.V.I. Probate Court, the judge 
11 
said, quote, "I think we agreed that everybody believes 
12 
this program is a great program," end quote.  So, again, 
13 
the sole holdup here has been the attorney general of the 
14 
Virgin Islands.  So I am confident in saying that the 
15 
program will formally move forward soon, that it will have 
16 
an overwhelmingly successful participation rate and be a 
17 
great success, which we always expect and that's what 
18 
everyone's been working hard towards. 
19 
Meanwhile, I agree with Ms. Wang -- and, actually, 
20 
counsel for Maxwell has said this in a letter to the Court, 
21 
as well -- that every dollar spent on litigation, which 
22 
again plaintiffs' counsel in some of the other matters 
23 
before your Honor have been driving up through, you know, 
24 
unnecessary motions, unnecessary requests to make discovery 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 13 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
14 
motions, that is money that will never possibly be 
2 
available to fund the program, which we have been trying to 
3 
do since day one.  You may recall, your Honor, that it was 
4 
plaintiffs' counsel, different plaintiffs' counsel, who 
5 
resisted stays of litigation.  So, again, I was surprised 
6 
to hear the comments about cost concerns. 
7 
But we agree with where Ms. Wang is at this now, 
8 
it would be a disservice to claimants and a waste of 
9 
judicial resources during a time when such resources are, 
10 
as evidenced by, you know, this conference call, stretched 
11 
very thin due to the unprecedented situation we find 
12 
ourselves in with the pandemic, for money to be spent on 
13 
litigation.  It was for that reason that when Ms. Wang 
14 
approached us, which also bears mentioning that they 
15 
approached us about this concept of an informal stay, we 
16 
proposed that we do the same stay that we've done in some 
17 
of the other actions before your Honor, which if your Honor 
18 
recalls, those orders -- basically, people can lift them at 
19 
any time if they decide they don't want to participate in 
20 
the program or for whatever reason.  They can go to your 
21 
Honor and request a lift of the stay.  Ms. Wang didn't 
22 
agree to that; and, therefore, we, you know, agreed to what 
23 
was offered, which was this kind of informal stay, followed 
24 
by a --

start soon, matter of weeks, not months, finally.  And I 
10 
agree with the call's concerns, which is that all these 
11 
actions to be stayed for people that intend to participate 
12 
in the program, which as I understand it, is every 
13 
plaintiff in every action that's before your Honor, 
14 
including the ones that we're here talking about now. 
15 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So on the deadlines, what 
16 
you're looking for -- correct me if I'm wrong on this -- 
17 
for fact discovery, you want deadline extension from 
18 
July 10 to October 8, is that right? 
19 
MS. WANG:  I believe that's correct.  There's a 
20 
letter -- 
21 
THE COURT:  That's -- oh, I'm sorry, I may be 
22 
looking at the wrong -- no, I think so. Yes. That's not a 
23 
30-days? 
24 
MS. WANG:  I apologize, your Honor.  This is --

16 
THE COURT:  The letter -- I pulled up the letter 
2 
in, I think it's the same letter that was written in all 
3 
three cases.  And it says in the letter that you're looking 
4 
for -- oh, I'm sorry, you're looking for 90 days.  You're 
5 
looking for 90 days and an extension -- 
6 
MS. WANG:  That's correct. 
7 
THE COURT:  -- on the answer deadline for 30. 
8 
MS. WANG:  Yes, your Honor.  And if I may -- this 
9 
is plaintiffs' counsel, Mariann Wang, again.  The idea was 
10 
for this informal stay of 30 days and essentially to kind 
11 
of reassess at that time; and, therefore, we were building 
12 
in a larger cushion at the back end. 
13 
And just for the record, for purposes of the 
14 
record, I just will have to say that I dispute some of the 
15 
things that Mr. Moskowitz said.  But I don't think it's 
16 
worth going into now.  I think there was a lot of effort on 
17 
the estate's part not to produce any documents or cooperate 
18 
until it decided that it could put four or five attorneys 
19 
on this matter.   
20 
But, in any event, for purposes of what's going on 
21 
right now, that is correct.  The idea was to build in a 
22 
little bit of extra cushion at the back end. 
23 
THE COURT:  So let me see if I understand this.  
24 
What you're saying is kick all the deadlines out by 90 
25

17 
days, discovery deadlines; don't do anything for 30 -- and 
2 
some time has already passed since you wrote the letter, 
3 
perhaps you're not even looking at 30 anymore -- and then 
4 
once those 30 days go by, start up again but at a more 
5 
leisurely pace because you have another 60 days? 
6 
MS. WANG:  No, your Honor.  The idea would be in 
7 
30 days we would report back to the Court about what the 
8 
best approach -- what the best approach would be -- 
9 
THE COURT:  Let me ask again if someone's joined 
10 
the line.  Has someone joined on the line?  Hello?  Those 
11 
beeps might mean someone left or someone joined. 
12 
Let me just make sure defense counsel is still 
13 
present.  Mr. Moskowitz? 
14 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I'm here, your Honor, Bennet 
15 
Moskowitz. 
16 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  I haven't set this 
17 
up with the computer dashboard that identifies people and 
18 
lets me know who joined and who dropped.  We're just doing 
19 
this as a straight phone call, so that's why I keep asking 
20 
the questions, to try to figure out who's present in my 
21 
courtroom, so to speak.  If a lawyer who's making an 
22 
argument suddenly gets up and walks out of the courtroom, 
23 
that's something I can see; but on the phone call, I have 
24 
to just make sure that that's not what happened, you know, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 17 of 25

18 
through some kind of dropped call or something. 
2 
Okay, so you were saying, counsel?  I'm sorry. 
3 
MS. WANG:  Yes, of course.  So, your Honor, the 
4 
idea was really basically a stay for 30 days and then 
5 
essentially an opportunity to reassess and confer with 
6 
opposing counsel and basically report to the Court about 
7 
the next steps of, you know, whether we are going back 
8 
into, you know, full-on litigation because everything seems 
9 
to be falling apart in the other -- in the other method of 
10 
resolution; or if, you know, it would appear that we can go 
11 
back or we can even enter into a more formal permanent 
12 
stay. 
13 
And to be clear, the reason I didn't like the 
14 
others -- and which -- and my clients were not amenable to 
15 
it is that my understanding is and the way it appeared is 
16 
that those other actions are essentially stays that don't 
17 
allow to pick up as easily.  If your Honor prefers a 
18 
different method of approach, I'm happy to confer with my 
19 
clients and opposing counsel and see if there's, you know, 
20 
a different method of doing this.  But the main thing from 
21 
my clients' perspective is the ability, essentially to, you 
22 
know, step back into litigation full bore if things are 
23 
seeming to not go in the right direction.  I'm very glad to 
24 
hear -- it's the first I'm hearing from Mr. Moskowitz, 
25

19 
although I had asked him earlier about, you know, news on 
2 
the V.I. proceeding -- I'm glad to hear that there is 
3 
progress.  And this is the first I'm hearing of this 
4 
June 15 start time. 
5 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I am still not quite 
6 
understanding your letter in light of what you're saying, 
7 
because you wrote the letter May 11.  So if I had granted 
8 
it immediately upon its receipt, your informal stay would 
9 
have lasted until June 10.  And then if what you say is it 
10 
would have given you an opportunity to report back shortly 
11 
thereafter -- let's say you would have reported back to me 
12 
by, say, June 12 or maybe June 15, if not June 10, you're 
13 
asking for an extension, based on this letter, to submit a 
14 
joint status report regarding, including, you know, among 
15 
other things, the progress of settlement discussions, to be 
16 
extended from June 1 to August 31.  August 31 is not in and 
17 
around the middle of June.   
18 
Why don't I just kick out the dates by some 
19 
reasonable period of time from now and ask for a status 
20 
report by a certain date?  And if you find that you still 
21 
need more time because, you know, things are logistically 
22 
difficult to get done because of the pandemic or something, 
23 
you can let me know, and I'll kick out the dates 
24 
specifically so that you can have a hiatus and save 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 19 of 25

20 
resources and still have time on the clock to get discovery 
2 
done if you need it.  But some of these dates aren't quite 
3 
making sense to me, and I'm not sure I'm understanding why 
4 
the 90 is necessary, why we need more time than the hiatus 
5 
time.  
6 
And if the more time is needed because you're 
7 
having problems agreeing on whether depositions can proceed 
8 
by remote means, I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone 
9 
else in the city of New York who's trying to litigate cases 
10 
right now, which is learn how to take depositions by remote 
11 
means.  Everybody is learning, and the providers have gone 
12 
up that learning curve, and things seem to be moving pretty 
13 
well.  I'm not forcing people's hands, but I am strongly 
14 
urging it.  And it seems to be pretty successful.  And if 
15 
you're in that kind of situation where you're trying to 
16 
negotiate protocol for remote depositions, I can give you a 
17 
case cite that I've been passing around.  The parties don't 
18 
even know, I'm sure, that I've been passing it around.  One 
19 
of my colleagues sent around a proposed remote deposition 
20 
protocol that litigants had submitted in a case, didn't 
21 
bless it, didn't endorse it.  There was particular provider 
22 
mentioned, and certainly the Court's not endorsing any 
23 
particular provider or anything, but it showed some 
24 
thought.  And I've been passing this citation onto other 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 20 of 25

21 
lawyers as something to glance at as maybe giving rise to 
2 
ideas and having a basis for discussion.  I thought it 
3 
showed that some time and effort was put into considering 
4 
the issues that can arise.  So let me give you that 
5 
citation.  It's Compus Productions International v. Charter 
6 
Communication.  It's 18-cv-12296.  It's a case before Judge 
7 
Marrero and Magistrate Judge Moses, and it's Docket 51 in 
8 
that case, 18-cv-12296.  Again, I'm not blessing it; I'm 
9 
just pointing it out as people wrestle with these kinds of 
10 
concepts. 
11 
But so why don't I just extend your deadlines 
12 
somewhat?  It's now already May 22, so I could kick them 
13 
out to, let's say -- or by 45 days or something like that; 
14 
ask for a status report by the middle of June; and you'll 
15 
tell me what's going on.  And the reason for me to kick it 
16 
out is with the understanding that you want to pause 
17 
things, try to preserve resources, and I'm putting another 
18 
45 days at the end of the schedule to enable you to get 
19 
things done.  And you can, you know, map out a deposition 
20 
schedule if you have to for that time.  And if you run into 
21 
logistical problems, you can get back to me and tell me 
22 
what those logistical problems are.  Or maybe even 60.  
23 
But, you know, what you put out here doesn't seem to quite 
24 
hold together.

MS. WANG:  This is plaintiffs' counsel.  Fair 
2 
enough, your Honor.  That makes perfect sense from our 
3 
perspective. 
4 
THE COURT:  Okay, look, so here's what I'm going 
5 
to do.  I'm going to move out all deadlines on your 
6 
scheduling order by 60 days, with the understanding that if 
7 
for the next, well, until the middle of June when you know 
8 
if this program is starting, anyway, whatever makes sense, 
9 
whether it's 30 days or until June 15, you can discuss that 
10 
between you, for some period of time you're going to hold 
11 
off on incurring costs.  And then, at the end of that point 
12 
in time, maybe by June -- why don't I just say by June 
13 
19 -- by June 19, which is the end of that week that starts 
14 
June 15 -- by June 19, send me a status report, which is 
15 
either things are going great, we want to stay this longer 
16 
because we really are participating in this program; or 
17 
things look grim, it's taken a downturn in the Virgin 
18 
Islands, and we want to get back on the calendar and we've 
19 
started talking about that; and because of some logistical 
20 
issues, we think we need more time or we think we're okay 
21 
or whatever.  But 60 days on the dates, with an 
22 
understanding that you're going to pause things 
23 
cooperatively and give me a status report by June 19.  
24 
Rational?

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That is acceptable to us.  Bennet

Moskowitz.  Thank you. 
5 
THE COURT:  Okay.  I will issue an order, probably 
6 
just a text order on the docket, that will confirm that for 
7 
you.  I will look at the schedule we have and put firm 
8 
dates on that are 60 days out so you have definite dates 
9 
for various and assorted things.  If some dates have 
10 
already gone by, don't worry about it because they'll have 
11 
kicked out 60, you know, retroactively.  And I am assuming 
12 
that neither of you is going to start jumping up and down, 
13 
saying this week we must now have depositions happening.  I 
14 
assume that you're going to wait until approximately 
15 
June 15 to see if it's really necessary and report by

June 19.

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Bennet Moskowitz here.  We have,

yes, no intention of that, your Honor, and I just --

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  Not what I want. 
21 
THE COURT:  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Look, my 
22 
intention is to balance things.  You know, if there's a 
23 
realistic chance of it getting settled, any of these cases 
24 
getting settled, that's great.  And I don't want you

spending unnecessary funds.  But if there are problems with 
2 
it, I want to keep discovery moving in a rational way, 
3 
keeping costs reasonably under control, keep you talking, 
4 
keep you planning.  That was the concept all along.  And so

that's the balancing act.  Okay?

10 
handled somewhat differently with different counsel, and so 
11 
be it.  I was thinking I'd try to get you all more or less 
12 
on the same track, but there are always going to be some 
13 
divergences.

Okay.  Thank you, all.
