A beautiful warm day in New York 
Under a canopy of Cherry Blossoms in Central Park. 1:45 PM. Photo: JH. 
Some people were beginning to complain about the heat. A good 
sign. Beauty abounds. 
I went to an early dinner over at Swifty's with some old friends in from 
out of town. The place was jammed on this early Monday night in New 
York. 
At the table by the open windows was Lee Radziwill with friends. At 
another table, Jim Kaufman was dining with Laura Codman, in from 
Texas on her way to London. Laura is directly descended from Ogden 
Codman, the gran-pappy of 20th century interior design. Ogden 
Codman is now the god of interior design. Talk about influence, talk 
about power in New York! Except he's dead. Daid. And I'll bet at least 
50% of the design community (sorry, but I'll bet I'm right) doesn't have a 
clue as to WHO Ogden Codman is/was. Or even his collaborator Edith 
Wharton. That's okay, that's show biz.

CASE NO. 2006CF009454A 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his attorney and 
files his response to the Motion For Protective Order filed by counsel for State's witness 
Jane Doe No. 1. 
1. In summary fashion, counsel for Jane Doe No. 1 complains that serving a 
witness for deposition by the use of a process server and the service of the witness' 
parents for the deposition to ensure service, amounts to "continuous and systematic 
harassment". 1  
2. The Motion For Protective Order was filed by one of the attorneys purporting to 
represent Jane Doe No. 1 in a separate civil proceeding.2  While disagreeing with the 
Undersigned counsel for the Defendant responds only to the issues in the Motion for 
Protective Order concerning service of a subpoena for deposition and the date for that deposition. 
Defendant and undersigned counsel have no knowledge of any agent of the Defendant going to 
the witness' place of employment representing "himself as an attorney who needed to contract 
(sp) her" as alleged "on information and belief' in paragraph 8 of the Motion for Protective 
Order. 
2  The Motion for Protective Order was filed by attorney Theodore Leopold. While he 
purports to represent Jane Doe No.1, attorney Jeffrey Herman also claims to represent the 
interests of Jane Doe No. 1. In that separate civil proceeding, the two law firms are presently 
litigating who represents the interests of Jane Doe No. 1.

CASE NO. 2006CF009454A 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his attorney and 
files his response to the Motion For Protective Order filed by counsel for State's witness 
Jane Doe No. 1. 
1. In summary fashion, counsel for Jane Doe No. 1 complains that serving a 
witness for deposition by the use of a process server and the service of the witness' 
parents for the deposition to ensure service, amounts to "continuous and systematic 
harassment". 1  
2. The Motion For Protective Order was filed by one of the attorneys purporting to 
represent Jane Doe No. 1 in a separate civil proceeding.' While disagreeing with the 
Undersigned counsel for the Defendant responds only to the issues in the Motion for 
Protective Order concerning service of a subpoena for deposition and the date for that deposition. 
Defendant and undersigned counsel have no knowledge of any agent of the Defendant going to 
the witness' place of employment representing "himself as an attorney who needed to contract 
(sp) her" as alleged "on information and belief" in paragraph 8 of the Motion for Protective 
Order. 
2  The Motion for Protective Order was filed by attorney Theodore Leopold. While he 
purports to represent Jane Doe No.1, attorney Jeffrey Herman also claims to represent the 
interests of Jane Doe No. 1. In that separate civil proceeding, the two law firms are presently 
litigating who represents the interests of Jane Doe No. 1.

CASE NO: 2006 CF 009454 A 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
Defendant. 
/ 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
Jane Doe No. 1 ("Jane Doe"), by and through her mother and natural guardian, hereby 
files this Motion for Protective Order. As grounds for said motion, Jane Doe states as follows: 
1. 
On July 19, 2006 the State of Florida filed a criminal Indictment against Jeffrey 
Epstein ("Epstein"). 
2. 
Jane Doe, a victim of Epstein's actions, recently filed a civil lawsuit against 
Epstein. The complaint alleges among other things that Epstein has a sexual preference and 
obsession for underage minor girls. That he engaged in a scheme in which he gained access to 
minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Jane Doe was 
one of Epstein's victims. She was lured into Epstein's Palm Beach home under false pretenses 
and was sexually assaulted by Epstein. As a result, Jane Doe suffered injuries, including 
intentional infliction of emotional distress damages. 
07/26/17
Page 35
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

3. 
After the filing of the civil lawsuit and during the week of January 25, 2008, 
Epstein's criminal attorney, Jack Goldberger, Esq., contacted the undersigned to advise that he 
wished to take the deposition, in the criminal matter, of Jane Doe on February 6, 2008. The 
undersigned informed Mr. Goldberger that he would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, but 
was not available on February 6, 2008. Counsel agreed to use best efforts to schedule the 
deposition at a mutually convenient date and time. 
4. 
Despite these assurances and understanding, on Friday evening, February 1, 2008, 
Epstein's process server served Jane Doe at her place of work for a deposition scheduled to take 
place on February 6, 2008. I  See Subpeona attached as Exhibit "A" (Jane Doe's real name has 
been redacted from the exhibit). 
5. 
The undersigned was forced to call Mr. Goldberger on Friday evening and remind 
him of our earlier conversation and agreement and to insist that the deposition be re-noticed.2  
6. 
After the conversation of Friday evening and with the expressed assurances that 
the undersigned would accept service for Jane Doe, two days later on Monday morning February 
4, 2008, Mr. Goldberger had a process server serve Jane Doe's mother who resides out of state in 
. See Subpoena attached as Exhibit "B" (Jane Doe's mother's name has been 
redacted from the exhibit). 
7. 
The service of process on Jane Doe's mother was defective as an Out of State 
Commissioner was never appointed and no order was issued by this court authorizing such 
service. Additionally, Mr. Goldberger had been told not once, but twice that the undersign would 
accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, yet despite this Epstein and/or his attorney has insisted on 
1 Mr. Goldberger unilaterally set Jane Doe's deposition for February 6, 2008 despite knowing that the undersigned 
was not available on that date. 
2 Mr. Goldberger has now agreed to postpone the deposition.

having the victim's privacy repeatedly intruded upon by process servers seeking her out at her 
employment and then again, intruding upon her mother. 
8. 
Additionally, during this same time period yet another adult male came to Jane 
Does' employment and represented himself as an "attorney" who needed to contract her. Upon 
information and belief that person was also an agent of Mr. Epstein's. 
9. 
It can only be concluded that Epstein and/or his counsel are purposefully 
attempting to harass Jane Doe and her mother. These actions are nothing more than a continuous 
insult to injury upon a young girl who has already been emotionally scarred for life. 
WHEREFORE, Jane Doe, by and through Jane Doe's mother and natural guardian, 
hereby move the Court for a Protective Order prohibiting Jeffrey Epstein and/or his counsel from 
continuous and systematic harassment.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 15TH 
JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR PALM 
BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
Case No.: 502006CF009454AXXXMB 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
v. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
COMES NOW, Witness Y. Doe,1  by and through undersigned counsel, 
respectfully moves for a protective order pursuant to Florida Rule Criminal Procedure 
3.220(1)(1), requiring that the deposition of Y. Doe be taken in this matter in conjunction 
with and at the same time with the deposition of Y. Doe in the civil case captioned Jane 
Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida. As grounds therefore, Witness Y. Doe 
states as follows: 
1. 
Y. Doe has been subpoenaed for deposition in this case by the Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein. The subpoena schedules the deposition for April 2, 2008. 
2. 
Y. Doe is a victim in this matter who alleges that she was sexually 
assaulted by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein when she was 16 years old. Y. Doe has brought a 
civil case against Defendant Epstein captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case 
' The witness is named here anonymously as "Y. Doe" because of the sensitive 
allegations of sex abuse upon a minor involved in this case.

no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District 
of Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein. 
3. 
It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and 
issues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases. 
4. 
It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and 
necessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by 
Defendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and 
traumatic facts in separate depositions for each case. 
5. 
It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this 
case if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same 
time. 
6. 
Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220(1)(1) provides that the Court 
may issue a protective order "as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, 
unnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the 
deposition." Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(h)(1) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe's 
circumstances will only be subject to one deposition: "In any case, no person shall be 
deposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued 
on good cause shown." 
7. 
This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal 
case from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d 1338 (Fla. 1993); State v.  
Tarrago, 800 So.2d 300 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001). A requirement that a single deposition be 
taken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary 
emotional harm to Y. Doe. Finally, the taking of two separate depositions of Y. Doe by 
2

Defendant Epstein would be harassment. A protective order under rule 3.220(1)(1) would 
prevent this harassment. 
8. 	
Counsel for Witness Y. Doe has contacted both the attorneys for the State 
and for Defendant Epstein regarding this request, and neither has responded. 
WHEREFORE, Witness Y. Doe respectfully requests a protective order requiring 
that the deposition in the criminal case and the civil case captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v.  
Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for 
the Southern District of Florida, be taken at the same time, and for such further relief as 
this Court deems just and proper.

Re: 	
State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2006CF009454AXX 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
We have left a number of messages with you to coordinate depositions of our clients in 
this case, without response. With regard to the depositions of our clients, it is necessary and 
appropriate for the entry of a court order which would require that one deposition be taken of 
each of our clients for use in both the criminal case and the civil case. A single deposition is 
warranted given that the facts of the sexual assault are common to both the civil and criminal 
cases, and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is the same in both cases. A single deposition is in the 
best interests of the emotional well being of the victim. In another case we were involved in 
where both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Attorney's office filed a 
motion for protective order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(1)(1) asking that 
the depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time, 
We would like to coordinate and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue 
concerning the depositions of our clients. The deposition of 	
is presently 
scheduled for Wednesday, April 2, 2008. Please let us know how you would like to proceed in 
this important matter as soon as possible.
