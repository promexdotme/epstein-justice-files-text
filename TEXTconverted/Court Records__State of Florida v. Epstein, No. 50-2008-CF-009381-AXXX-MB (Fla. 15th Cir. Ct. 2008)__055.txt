THE COURT: 
I do, the one that was 
handed up to me yesterday? 
MR. CRITTON: 
Yes, sir, and I have a 
proposed order in the event the Court 
chooses to grant; may I provide that to the 
Court as well? 
Your Honor, as you know, 
Mr. Goldberger and I represent Mr. Epstein. 
We have hired Ms. Walsh and Ms. Compiani as 
appellate counsel to assist in the filing 
of a writ of certiorari. 
I know that comes 
as no surprise to the Court in that whoever 
prevailed and lost yesterday, I think the 
Court recognized we probably filed a writ 
of certiorari. 
THE COURT: 
Let me ask real quick. 
Anybody objecting to the defendant having 
the ability to have my decision reviewed by 
the appellate court before I release these 
things? 
I mean, it seems pretty straight 
forward. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
We have an objection, 
your Honor, to some extent. 
The -- you 
know, the procedure in place here is very

similar to that for which they would have 
to obtain a preliminary injunction. 
THE COURT: 
Right. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
So to demonstrate 
likelihood of success and irreparable harm, 
I don't think they can do that. 
I think 
the plan that you put in -- proposed 
yesterday is a good one, that is you redact 
and you release on Monday and that gives 
them today and Monday to get to the Fourth, 
otherwise, we're stuck in a position where 
we have a 30-day window to appeal, and we 
are all delay, delay, delay. 
THE COURT: 
What if I do that? 
I 
don't know if it's a difference with that 
or distinction, but, procedurally, I was 
thinking I was leaning yesterday towards 
issuing the order that I just issued. 
I 
think that that's a fairly accurate 
rendition of the written version of my oral 
pronouncement yesterday, but I order that 
nothing -- that the redacted orders not be 
released until -- I'll make it, you know, 
five of five Monday. 
That will give you 
Monday to get down to the Fourth to get

them to stop this from being released; what 
do you think? 
MR. CRITTON: 
Here's what the problem 
is, Judge, is Ms. Compiani and Ms. Walsh 
spoke to them yesterday and today, we need 
a transcript from the hearing yesterday 
which has not yet been obtained. 
They need 
the underlying motions, they need some time 
to research. 
It's not a matter of simply 
filing a writ of petition and that stays 
the release of the order. 
There would have 
to be a separate motion that would be filed 
with the Appellate Court. 
The Motion to 
Stay that we file under Appellate Rule 
9.310, subsection A, it provides that the 
party that seeks review shall come to the 
lower tribal, which is the trial court, 
which is you, in this instance, and then 
it's within your discretion either to stay 
or not to stay under the circumstances, and 
we simply don't have the time within which 
to file the appeal under those 
circumstances. 
There are two criteria that have 
to be met here, one is the likelihood of

harm where no stay is granted, and the 
second criteria, not necessary mutually 
exclusive; that is, you don't have to have 
both of them, but you certainly have to 
give an indicia of both of them. 
The 
second one is the likelihood of success on 
the merits. 
We believe that based upon the 
Court decision, respectfully, that the 
Court, that the Appellate Court, will quash 
your order, for the reasons Judge Puccillo 
was the one who requested that the document 
in this -- this was argued yesterday, so 
I'm going to be very brief. 
She is the one 
who requested post sentencing, that the 
document be filed under seal. 
It was her 
request that the defense seceded to that 
under the circumstances. 
That certainly 
was inadvertent, could have just as easily 
remained under seal with Mr. Goldberger or 
with the State Attorney under those 
circumstances. 
Secondly, that it relates to the 
portions of it, specifically, within the 
MPA to deal with the grand jury proceeding,

that would be a violation of Federal Rule 
Six. 
I note you just handed us your order 
about two minutes ago, Judge, so no one's 
had an opportunity to review it, certainly 
appellate counsel has not had an 
opportunity to review it. 
I don't know if 
you dealt with the appellate rule, but I do 
note that within your written order, that 
you, basically, said that in the second to 
last page, you said this order is no way to 
be interpreted as permission not to comply 
with U.S. District Court Judge Marra's 
previous orders. 
We respectfully submit that it would 
not comply with Judge Marra's previously 
issued orders. 
We also believe that the 
supremacy clause, as Mr. Goldberger argued 
yesterday in conjunction with comity 
principle, that we think that there's a 
substantial likelihood on success of the 
merits on this. 
With regard to the likelihood of 
harm, this is a paramount issue here. 
It's 
undisputed that this was a confidential 
agreement. 
It's a confidential contract

between Mr. Epstein and the United States. 
United States vigorously defended 
10 
Mr. Edwards when he came into federal court 
and filed an action to have the MPA 
released, Judge Marra subsequently entered 
an order. 
Another attempt that was made to 
make the MPA public again. 
All plaintiffs' counsel has it. 
The only ones that don't have it is the 
Post, under the circumstances, and public 
under the circumstances, but all the 
plaintiffs' lawyers of the alleged victims, 
they either have the MPA and the addendum, 
which I will refer to as the MPA, or they 
have the ability to get that. 
That is very 
clear from Judge Marra's order. 
So there's certainly no harm to 
the plaintiffs from under these 
circumstances. 
And the harm in this 
instance is only to Mr. Epstein under the 
circumstances because as Judge Letz 
(phonetic) once said, it's very much like 
an attorney/client privilege or a privilege 
document where once the proverbial horse is 
out of the barn, you can't get him back in.

We cited a case called Mariner versus 
Baker 3 -- So. 39, So.2d 608 First District 
1989. 
In the Mariner case, this was not a 
usual incident report and the Court, I know 
your Honor previously did a great deal of 
personal injury work and related work, 
you're very familiar. 
In fact, you 
commented yesterday and said, I don't see 
how the MPA is going to be admissible in a 
civil proceeding anyway. 
Again, you're not 
ruling on that ultimately, the judges in 
both the State and federal court cases will 
do that. 
In the Mariner case, the judge 
ordered that the defendants object at the 
direction of incident reports. 
The judge 
said, sorry, you've got to produce those 
incident reports. 
And the Court said, give 
them to me under seal because, again, we 
are talking about incident reports as 
distinct from an agreement between two 
parties which was deemed to be confidential 
between the United States government and 
Mr. Epstein. 
Only irreparable harm here as 
to Mr. Epstein because if it's released,

you cannot remedy that harm on appeal. 
And in the Mariner case, if the judge 
said, if you put the documents under seal, 
which is exactly the situation we have now 
is, I will grant the stay and let the 
appellate court determine whether or not 
incident reports, which have a much lower 
threshold for production or for discovery 
reasons, and, again, there's no harm in an 
instance like that, even in an incident 
report came out in the Mariner cases, so 
what. 
It won't be used, you can't use any 
of the information you obtained. 
In this 
particular instance, because it is 
confidential, there is no way the Court can 
remedy the harm. 
With regard to the defendants in this 
case, again, I think we've demonstrated 
both irreparable harm, and we believe a 
substantial likelihood on the success. 
Again, how do you demonstrate a substantial 
likelihood on the success? 
The fact that 
we would -- if this Court thought that we 
should prevail, my guess, you would not 
have ruled as you did, but as the Court is

aware, oh, surprise to all of the lawyers 
here. 
Sometimes judges get reversed. 
I 
know that's a shock to most of the lawyers 
in this room and most of the courts, but 
that happens on occasion, and, therefore, 
we believe we can show through the 
supremacy clause, the grand jury reference 
that we will prevail and that your order 
will be quashed.

With regard to alleged harm by any 
other party, the Post in this instance 
reported at the sentencing of Mr. Epstein 
on or about June 30th of 2008. 
They waited 
until June 1st of '09. 
This was such a 
pressing issue, the Post wanted to get this 
desperately out to the public, they were so 
anxious to do it, that they waited 11 
months before they did anything. 
Mr. Edwards, who is not here 
today, filed a federal court action and 
those issues were talked about and 
discussed at some length with regard to 
Judge Marra's two orders. 
Judge Marra's rule, you can't get 
them, if you want to get them, go to that

case, that would be Judge Hafele or two of 
Mr. Edwards' cases are where is Mr. Kuvin's 
case is or Judge Marra, where Mr. Edwards' 
case is. 
Judge Marra can certainly control 
whether or not they should be released, and 
I've covered Mr. 
oh, and Mr. Edwards 
because he could have gone back to Judge 
Marra because he's got one federal court 
case -- did he try for that form and get 
it 
no, they came in here. 
He tried to 
do it in a run around Judge Marra. 
He didn't file his motion until 
late May of '09. 
My guess is it was 
Mr. Edwards who probably said to the Post, 
gee, why don't you join in this, you 
haven't been here for 11 months, why don't 
you come in now, maybe intervene. 
And then 
Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, 1111 
estate court case, came in on June 11th, 
again, almost a year to the date after 
Mr. Epstein's sentence. 
It's no burning issue, there's no 
fire here to put out, giving us 30 days, or 
at least a reasonable period of time to 
file petition for writ, and then if the

Court denies our stay at least asking the 
appellate court for stay under the 
circumstances. 
There's no harm to them. 
The harm is only to Mr. Epstein, and we 
think as a substantial likelihood, that we 
would succeed. 
Therefore, we would request the 
Court grant a stay as I've suggested in my 
proposed order for 30 days of giving 
Ms. Walsh and Ms. Compiani an opportunity 
to actually do their job under the 
circumstances, so the court reporter 
15 
doesn't have to work over the weekend to 
expedite transcripts for us, and secondly, 
if we file within the 30 days, then let the 
appellate court determine whether or not 
the stay remains or not. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you much. 
Ms. Shullman, don't worry about 
responding to the issue of motive or 
seeking this relief or the timing of your 
request or party's request. 
I don't think 
that bears upon the merits of either 
parties.

I think that it is a 
I think he's got to jump 
over both hurdles. 
I think he's got to 
show some likelihood of success. 
If you 
want to spend some energy arguing that 
there's no irreparable harm, you may do so, 
but if I hand it out today and everybody 
gets to see it, you can't fix that 
tomorrow.

Let me address that 
very briefly first, your Honor, to remind 
you in meeting this burden that they failed 
to meet yesterday, they identified four 
interests which they liken now to the 
motion to stay to the four harms.

them, they mentioned they have no standing 
to assert the compelling government 
interest, the government didn't show up, 
the imminent threat to the administration 
of justice, again, that's the government's 
issue. 
The innocent third party privacy 
rights, they have no standing. 
The only 
17 
one is, he's not really articulated today 
it's some sort of invasion of Mr. Epstein's 
privacy rights. 
Florida law is clear that those 
who are participants in crimes do not have 
privacy rights with respect to the facts 
and circumstances surrounding those crimes. 
So unless I'm going hear something outside 
of the context of Mr. Epstein's criminal 
prosecution, he has no privacy right in 
this agreement. 
THE COURT: 
Let me share with you 
what I'm thinking about doing, even at the 
conclusion of Mr. Critton's presentation, 
and that is deny the motion to stay, but 
delay the release of the records in 
question until noon Friday. 
That will give 
them a little bit of time to see if the

Fourth sees this case from a different 
vantage point, a different light, and maybe 
they'll look down and say, oh, Judge 
Colbath, you missed it and, you know, stay 
the matter. 
That will give them a 
reasonable amount of time to get the 
transcripts to go to the Fourth because I'm 
a big fan of appellate review and making 
case law. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
And I understand, your 
Honor, if you are suggesting a week from 
today, that's a little bit long. 
Remember 
the status quo here, we are in sort of a 
strange procedural posture because your 
Honor decided that the initial closure was 
improper, but the recent request for 
closure was denied, so instead of a status 
quo where we have a document that should be 
released, it's under seal where it 
shouldn't be, so any moment that it is kept 
under seal is a serious deprivation of the 
public and the press's right to access, 
which you have already determined they 
have, we think you are correct, of course, 
so I would ask that any stay --

MR. CRITTON: 
She's pandering, your 
Honor. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
I will say he 
respectfully disagreed with you, so I think 
a week is too long. 
I do this day in and 
day out, I have spent many a weekend on 
these matters in my career. 
If you want to 
give them till Tuesday, I'll be kind, but 
the Fourth will act quickly on this.

necessary. 
I think, in fact, it under

THE COURT: 
All right. 
Any other 
respondents want to go anything further? 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
The State Attorney's 
office also advises me that Friday is a 
holiday and the courts are closed. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you for telling me 
that. 
Friday is a holiday. 
MR. KUVIN: 
July 4th. 
THE COURT: 
The day of the birth of 
our constitution. 
MR. KUVIN: 
Good morning, your Honor. 
On behalf of intervenor 1111 obviously, the 
Court is inclined to delay the disclosure

of this, but under Rule 9.310, if your 
Honor were to issue such a stay, we would 
point out the provision C of the rule, 
which requires a posting of the bond. 
20 
We not only agree with your Honor's 
ruling, but we believe such appeal they are 
filing is absolutely frivolous and we are 
going to be requesting fees and cost for 
the filing of that appeal, so as a result, 
we are requesting a bond be posted if a 
stay of any type is issued in this case 
because of the fact that we want to make 
sure that our attorneys' fee and costs are 
covered for the frivolous nature of the 
appeal. 
And it's dictated strictly in 
subsection A. 
It gives the Court the 
authority. 
It says: 
A stay pending review may be 
conditioned upon a good and sufficient 
bond, other conditions or both. 
Therefore, 
we believe your Honor does have the 
authority to issue such a requirement that 
the posting of a bond be issued. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Thank you 
very much. 
I will deny the motion to stay.

I will delay the release of the documents 
until noon Thursday. 
I will deny the 
request to compel the movant, the 
defendant, Mr. Epstein, to post a bond, and 
I'll let the appellate court tell us and 
teach us what the law on this case will be. 
It's always interesting how these 
cases unfold and come to us a little 
different than everyone else. 
Now, let me 
have the attorneys come up here and 
approach. 
(The following proceedings were held 
sidebar, out of the hearing of the jury.) 
THE COURT: 
I reviewed the two 
documents, I didn't see any kids' names in 
there. 
Everybody was hinting the 
children's names or the initials' names. 
I 
had my big black highlighter out, I don't 
see anything worth redacting, so. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
It's the plaintiff's 
document that identifies the children's 
names. 
It's a letter to me actually. 
THE COURT: 
I was wondering if 
everybody thought there was something in 
there that wasn't in there.

skills, your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
You're right, exactly. 
One is page one through seven, and the 
second one is just two pages that's not 
even signed by everybody. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
While we're all up 
here chatting, there are references to 
other names up here. 
THE COURT: 
Yes, Mr. Goldberger, and 
no one has identified in the document says 
these are people that are not going to be 
prosecuted. 
Mr. Kuvin made the argument 
that these are co-conspirators. 
These are 
innocent people that have nothing to do 
with these proceedings.

MS. SHULLMAN:

Thursday at noon, and anybody that comes
