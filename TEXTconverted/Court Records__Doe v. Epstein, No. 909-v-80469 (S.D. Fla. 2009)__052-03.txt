DECLARATION OF JANE DOE NO. 6 
state as follows: 
I am the Plaintiff identified as Jane Doe No. 6 in this lawsuit. 
On July 9, 2009, an investigator came to the office of my former employer, A 
Affordable Auto Insurance, in Lake Worth, Florida. 
3. 
After the investigator left, I was contacted by my former employer and told that 
the investigator was asking personal questions about me. 
4. 
I am worried that Jeffrey Epstein will continue to send investigators to speak with 
other people I know who do not know that I am a Plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am concerned that 
the investigators will ask these people very personal questions about my life and disclose that I 
am a Plaintiff in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein. 
I declare under penalty of perjury the foregoing to be true and conect.
