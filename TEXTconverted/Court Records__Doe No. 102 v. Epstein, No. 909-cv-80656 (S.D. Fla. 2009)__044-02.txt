DECLARATION OF JANE DOE NO. 4 
I, 
, state as follows: 
I am the Plaintiff identified as Jane Doe No. 4 in this lawsuit. 
2. 
During the past week, three investigators working on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein 
contacted the office ofmy former employer, Florida Realty, on three separate occasions. 
3. 
During the contacts, the investigators asked my former employer personal 
questions about me, including whom I am dating and how they can contact my ex-boyfriend. 
The investigators obtained the name of my ex-boyfriend from my former employer and have 
been repeatedly contacting a former co-worker to get the telephone number of my ex-boyfriend. 
Once they obtained the number of my ex-boyfriend, they have repeatedly contact him, asking 
very personal questions about my relationship with him, as well as my current relationship, 
employment, and residence. 
4. 
None of the individuals whom the investigators have contacted or attempted to 
contact knew that I am a plaintiff in a childhood sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein, but 
now they are asking me questions about it. 
5. 
I am worried that J ef:frey Epstein will continue to send investigators to speak with 
people I know who do not know that I am a Plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am concerned that the 
investigators will ask these people very personal questions about my life and disclose that I am a 
Plaintiff in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein. It could cause problems in my social 
circle and with my future employment and educational opportunities if people fmd out that I am 
a plaintiff in a childhood sexual abuse suit against Jeffrey Epstein. 
I declare under penalty of perjury the foregoing to be true and correct.
