UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
NO. 09-80469-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON
JANE DOE II,
Plaintiff,
v.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN and
SARAH KELLEN,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
THIS CAUSE is before the Court sua sponte. 
This Court’s Order of March 25, 2009 directed the parties to confer within twenty-one
(21) calendar days after the filing of the first responsive pleading by the last responding
defendant, to submit a written report of this conference outlining their proposed discovery plan
within 14 days after the conference, to hold a scheduling conference either at the same time as
the discovery conference or within fourteen (14) calendar days thereafter, and finally, within
fourteen (14) days of the scheduling conference, file a joint scheduling report.  Thus, since the
Complaint in this case was filed March 24, 2009 and Defendant Sarah Kellen filed a responsive
pleading on October 21, 2009, the latest a joint scheduling report should have been filed was in
January of 2010. 
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff shall show cause why

they have failed to follow this Court’s Order, and shall further file a report on or before Friday,
July 2, 2010 as to the status of this case.  Failure to timely file a status report as ordered may
result in dismissal of the case.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 25  day of June, 2010.
