A. I work on the Violent Crimes Against Children 
Squad, so we work child exploitation, human 
trafficking, and international parental kidnapping 
matters. 
Q. Have you participated in an investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein and his associates? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Have you spoken to other people, including 
other law enforcement officers, about this 
investigation? 
A. Yes.

prepared by others regarding this case?

MS. 
Ladies and gentlemen, some of the 
testimony that you're going to hear today will 
include hearsay. As you know, that means that the 
witness will not be testifying solely from her own 
observations, but that she'll also be reporting 
what others have told her and what she's read in 
reports and documents prepared by others.

As you know, hearsay evidence is admissible in 
these grand jury proceedings, and you're free to 
rely on it in determining whether there is 
probable cause to indict the proposed defendant. 
If, however, you would like to hear the 
testimony of any other witness, you have the right 
to request it, and we will make reasonable efforts 
to bring that witness before you. 
BY MS.

I placed in front of

Exhibit 1. Is that a PowerPoint presentation that you
