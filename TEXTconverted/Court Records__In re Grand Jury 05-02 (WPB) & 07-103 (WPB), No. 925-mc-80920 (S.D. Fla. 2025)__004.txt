ORDER DENYING PETITION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS 
The matter before the Court is the United States' request to unseal grand jury transcripts 
stemming from the Government's investigation into Mr. Jeffrey Epstein in the Southern District 
of Florida. For the reasons set forth below, Eleventh Circuit law does not permit this Court to grant 
the Government's request; the Court's hands are tied-a point that the Government concedes. 
The Government initiated the matter before the Court by filing the United States' Petition 
to Unseal Grand Jury Transcripts on July 18, 2025, and the Government's Response to the Court's 
Order on Supplemental Briefing (hereinafter "Supp. Br.") on July 20, 2025 (together, the 
"Petition"). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6, the Government requests that the 
transcripts related to grand jury investigations 05-02 (WPB) and 07-103 (WPB) (the "Florida 
Federal Grand Jury Proceedings") be unsealed "subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related 
and other personal identifying information." Pet. at I. Additionally, the Government states that 
"[t]o the extent this Court maintains that this 'petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding 
in another district' ... the Court should 'transfer the petition to"' the Southern District of New 
York. Id. at 4-5 (referencing other petitions filed in United States v. Maxwell, No. 1 :20-CR-330 
(S.D.N.Y.) and United States v. Epstein, No. 1: 19-490 (S.D.N.Y.)) (the "New York Federal 
Proceedings").

I. 
BACKGROUND 
The Government's Petition seeks to unseal transcripts from the Florida Federal Grand Jury 
Proceedings-grand jury investigations into Mr. Epstein. The federal grand juries were convened 
in West Palm Beach in 2005 and 2007. 
Simultaneously with its filing of the instant Petition, the Government also filed parallel 
petitions to unseal transcripts in the Southern District of New York ("SONY"), which pertain to 
the 2019 and 2020 SONY federal grand jury investigations. The 2019 SONY grand jury returned 
an indictment charging Mr. Epstein with crimes including sex trafficking offenses. Pet. 1 I. The 
indictment was dismissed after Mr. Epstein committed suicide while awaiting trial. Id. The 2020 
SONY grand jury charged Mr. Epstein's "longtime confidant, Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell," with 
offenses related to the sex trafficking and coercion of minors. Id. 12; Maxwell, 1 :20-CR-330, 0kt. 
No. 1. After a conviction and sentencing in her case, Ms. Maxwell's sentence was affirmed by the 
Second Circuit. United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024). 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation issued a memorandum "describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative 
holdings related to" Mr. Epstein. Pet. at 1. The DOJ memorandum concluded that no evidence was 
uncovered "that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties." Id. Since the 
issuance of the DOJ memorandum, "there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the 
[m]emorandum's conclusions." Id. Because "[p]ublic officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary 
citizens remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein matter," the Government 
petitioned to unseal the relevant grand jury transcripts-including the Florida transcripts at issue 
in the pending Petition in this District. Id.

II. 
DISCUSSION 
The Petition contains two requests for relief: (I) a request to disclose evidence; and (2) a 
request to transfer the Petition to the Southern District of New York. Both requests are denied for 
the reasons stated below. 
1. 
The Government's Request to Disclose Evidence 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) governs the disclosure of grand jury proceedings. 
The Rule emphasizes a presumption of secrecy and mandates that, generally, "[ u ]nless the rules 
provide otherwise[,]" participants in the proceeding ''must not disclose a matter occurring before 
the grand jury." Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(8). Rule 6(e)(3) enumerates several specific exceptions 
to the general rule of nondisclosure. For example, the Rule provides that "a government attorney 
may, without prior court approval, disclose grand jury records to other government attorneys or 
officials for use in performing the attorneys' duties, or to other grand juries for the purpose of 
conducting criminal or intelligence investigations." Pitch v. United States, 953 F .3d 1226, 1234 
(I Ith Cir. 2020) (en bane) (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(A)-(D)), cert. denied, -- U.S.--, 141 S. 
Ct. 624 (2020) (citation modified). The Rule also provides exceptions where a district court may 
allow for disclosure of grand jury materials and states that a "court may authorize disclosure-at 
a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs-of a grand-jury matter" 
(I) "preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding"; (2) "at the request of a defendant 
who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred 
before the grand jury"; or (3) at the request of the government for use in a foreign, state, tribal, or 
military criminal investigation. Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i)-(v). 
The Government's Petition to unseal the grand jury transcripts is not based on any of the 
exceptions in Rule 6. Instead, the Government makes two arguments outside Rule 6. First, the 
Government argues that disclosure is proper because "many of the rationales supporting grand jury 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 4 of 12
secrecy under Rule 6(e) no longer apply to this investigation because of Jeffery Epstein's death." 
Supp. Br. at 5. It further argues that "the public's strong interest in th[e] historical investigation 
into Jeffrey Epstein constitutes a special circumstance justifying public disclosure." Id. (citation 
modified). Notably, the Government's requested exception is recognized only in the Second and 
Seventh Circuits. In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. 1973) (affirming release of grand jury 
witness testimony based on the "special circumstances'' of the case); In re Craig, 131 F .3d 99, 102 
(2d Cir. 1997) ("[W]e hold today that there is nothing ... that prohibits historical interest, on its 
own, from justifying release of grand-jury material in an appropriate case."); Carlson v. United 
States, 837 F.3d 753, 766-67 (7th Cir. 2016) (holding that a district court's inherent authority 
"includes the power to unseal grand jury materials in circumstances not addressed by 
Rule( e )(3 )(E)"). 
Contrary to the Government's stated basis and the Second and Seventh Circuits, 1 the 
Eleventh Circuit has directly held that a district court "do[ es] not possess the ... power to order 
the release of grand jury records in instances not covered by" Rule 6(e)(3)(E). 2 Pitch, 953 F.3d at 
1241. "District courts may only authorize the disclosure of grand jury materials if one of the five 
1 A district court is bound by the decisions of its intermediate appellate court. That is, this Court, the Southern District 
of Florida, is bound by the decisions of the Eleventh Circuit of Appeals. The Southern District ofNew York is bound 
by the decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. As discussed above, the Eleventh and Second Circuits have 
differing decisions regarding a district court's authority to disclose materials under Rule 6. Cf United States v. 
Maxwell, No. I :20-CR-330, Dkt. No. 789, 1-2 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2025) (requiring supplemental briefing on a "special 
circumstances" exception to Rule 6 recognized in the Second Circuit); United States v. Epstein, No. 1: 19-490, Dkt. 
No. 63, 1-2 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2025)(same). 
2 Before 2020, Eleventh Circuit case law held that •·a [district] court's power to order disclosure of grand jury records 
is not strictly confined to instances spelled out in" Rule 6. In re Petition to Inspect & Copy Grand Jury Materials, 735 
F.2d 126 I ( I Ith Cir. 1984 ). The Eleventh Circuit's en bane decision in Pitch, however, specifically overruled that 
decision. Pitch, 953 F.3d at 1229 ("We now hold that Rule 6(e) is exhaustive, and that district courts do not possess 
inherent, supervisory power to authorize the disclosure of grand jury records outside of Rule 6(e)(3)'s enumerated 
exceptions. We therefore overrule our holding in Hastings to the contrary."). And because Pitch was decided by an 
en bane panel of the Eleventh Circuit, it is the definitive law in this circuit. See Scott v. United States, 890 F.3d 1239, 
1257 (11th Cir.2018) ("The prior-panel-precedent rule requires subsequent panels of the court to follow the precedent 
of the first panel to address the relevant issue, 'unless and until the first panel's holding is overruled by the Court 
sitting en bane or by the Supreme Court."'). 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 5 of 12
exceptions listed in Rule 6(e)(3)(E) applies." Id.; accord McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 850 
(D.C. Cir. 2019) ("[A] district court has no authority outside Rule 6(e) to disclose grand jury 
matter[s]."); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 840 (8th Cir. 2009) ("[C]ourts will not 
order disclosure absent a recognized exception to Rule 6(e) or a valid challenge to the original 
sealing order or its implementation."); In re Grand Jury89-4-72, 932 F.2d 481,488 (6th Cir. 1991) 
("[A court] cannot, and must not, breach grand jury secrecy for any purpose other than those 
embodied by [Rule 6]."). 
The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the drafters of Rule 6 "permitted deviations from the 
general rule of secrecy only when the 'rules provide otherwise'-not when the court provides 
otherwise." Pitch, 953 F.3d at 1235 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)) (emphasis in original). That 
"intentional choice" by the drafters highlights their "understanding that disclosure should be 
limited to the text of Rule 6(e).'' Id. To hold otherwise would have been to "render the detailed list 
of exceptions to Rule 6(e)(2) merely precatory." Id. at 1236; see also Andrus v. Glover Constr. 
Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (I 980) ("Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to 
a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a 
contrary legislative intent."). Accordingly, Pitch held that "Rule 6(e) is exhaustive, and that district 
courts do not possess ... power to authorize the disclosure of grand jury records outside of Rule 
6( e)(3)'s enumerated exceptions." 953 F .3d at 1229. 
The Government does not assert that disclosure is appropriate under any exception in Rule 
6( e )(3 )(E). Instead, it argues that special circumstances exist and that the po I icy reasons for grand 
jury secrecy have expired. However, the Government's stated rationale are not exceptions in Rule 
6. The Court cannot grant a request for disclosure unless one of the five exceptions in Rule 
6(e)(3)(E) applies. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 6 of 12
The Government concedes as much in its Petition. It acknowledges that the "Department 
of Justice recognizes that this Court is bound by Pitch'' and that it "raises this argument due to the 
significance of the matter and to preserve it for any potential appeal." Pet.~ 6. In its Supplemental 
Briefing, the Government further recognizes that "Eleventh Circuit precedent holds that no 
exception outside those expressly enumerated under" Rule 6 "authorizes a court to publicly 
disclose grand jury materials." Supp. Br. at 3. Finally, the Government acknowledges that this 
Court cannot contravene binding Eleventh Circuit case law. Id. ("The [G]ovemment also 
recognizes that, in this circuit, only an en bane decision or the Supreme Court may overrule that 
decision."). Consistent with Pitch and the Government's concessions, the request to disclose is 
denied. 
2. 
The Government's Request for Transfer to the Southern District of New York 
The Court denies the Government's request for transfer for two reasons. The Court 
concludes that the Government must argue a potentially valid exception for the Court to consider 
a request for transfer of the Petition to another district, which the Government has not done. The 
Court also concludes that, in the alternative, the applicable standard for a transfer of the Petition 
to another district is not met in this case. 
a) The Petition is Not Eligible for Transfer Under Rule 6(e)(3)(G) 
The Government argues that its Petition is eligible for transfer to the New York Federal 
Proceedings under Rule 6(e)(3)(G), which states that "[i]f the petition to disclose arises out of a 
judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other 
court unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper." Supp. 
Br. at 1. Transfer is proper here, the Government argues, because the Florida Federal Grand Jury 
Proceedings were merely grand jury investigations, whereas the New York Federal Proceedings 
resulted in an indictment and a criminal proceeding. Id. at 2-3. Therefore, the Government argues, 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 7 of 12
"[t]he Southern District of New York can better assess the need for the release of transcripts 
resulting from those historic cases and the scope of necessary redactions based upon information 
already disseminated through the trial and public docket." Id. 
Based on the Court's review of Rule 6(e)(3)(G), the Government cannot invoke Rule 6 
because it has not accompanied its request to transfer with an argument for a legally permissible 
disclosure exception. Stated differently, the Government must first argue that there is a valid 
ground to request a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) disclosure-disclosure authorized preliminarily to or in 
connection with a judicial proceeding. The Court reaches this conclusion based upon Rule 6(e)(3), 
the advisory committee notes, and the Supreme Court case that resulted in Rule 6(e)(3)(G). 
The 1983 Advisory Committee Note explains that a potential Rule 6(e)(3)(G) transfer "is 
currently governed by Douglas Oil and the authorities cited therein, and is best left to elaboration 
by future case law." Turning to Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Northwest, the 
Supreme Court set forth the test for when a district court may authorize disclosure of grand jury 
transcripts "preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding": 
Parties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must show [1] that the 
material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial 
proceeding, [2] that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued 
secrecy, and that [3] their request is structured to cover only material so needed. 
441 U.S. 211, 222 (1979). The Supreme Court noted, however, that it can be difficult for the 
petitioned court 3 to conduct the Douglas Oil balancing test because the petitioned court lacks 
special knowledge about the related judicial proceeding. Id. at 229-30. Therefore, the Supreme 
Court explained that the "better practice'' in this circumstance would be for the petitioned court to 
conduct a written evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy and then transfer the 
3 Pursuant to Rule 6(e)(3)(F), "[a] petition to disclose a grand-jury matter under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) must be filed in the 
district where the grand jury convened." 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 8 of 12
petition, requested materials, and evaluation to the court presiding over the related judicial 
proceeding. Id. at 230-31. The Supreme Court reasoned that the court overseeing the related 
judicial proceeding would have the required "special knowledge" of the underlying litigation and 
could therefore best "consider[] the requests for disclosure in light of the [transferring] court's 
evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy." Id. at 231. 
This "better practice" articulated by the Supreme Court was codified in the current Rule 
6(e)(3)(G) governing transfer. Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 advisory committee's note to 1983 amendment; 
United States v. Lischewski, No. 18-CR-00203-EMC-1, 2023 WL 2600451, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 
22, 2023). The 1983 Committee Note highlights the connection between Rules 6(e)(3)(E)(i) and 
6(e)(3)(G), stating that "[u]nder the first sentence in new subdivision (e)(3)(E), the petitioner or 
any intervenor might seek to have the matter transferred to the federal district court where the 
judicial proceeding giving rise to the petition is pending." 
The Court reads Rule 6(e)(3)(G) to require a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception-that is, transfer 
of a petition to disclose made "preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding." See 
2 Fed. Grand Jury§ 18: 10 (2d ed.) ("Rules 6(e)(3)(F) and 6(e)(3)(G) combine to create a procedure 
that must be followed when seeking disclosure under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i), i.e., for use preliminary 
to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."); see also In re Grand Jury Investigation, No. l 8-
GJ-00008 (BAH), 2019 WL 13160140, at *3 (D.D.C. Oct. 30, 2019) (discussing the Rule 
(6)(e)(3)(G) transfer provision in the context of the Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception). 
The Government indirectly acknowledges the need for its transfer request to be 
accompanied with a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception because it relies upon the language of Rule 
6(e)(3)(F) as a basis for filing the Petition in this District. Supp. Br. at 2; Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e)(3)(F). 
Pursuant to its text, Rule 6(e)(3)(F) applies only when there is a basis for disclosure under Rule 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 9 of 12
6(e)(3)(E)(i), yet no argument exists in the Petition in support of a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception. 
Instead, the Government's arguments concern only the public-interest-focused special 
circumstances justifying disclosure-circumstances not addressed in Rule 6( e )(3 )(E). 
Because the Government does not seek disclosure under the Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception, 
and because the Government provides no argument as to why that exception should apply, the 
Government's request to transfer the Petition to the Southern District of New York pursuant to 
Rule 6(e)(3)(G) is denied. 
b) The Legal Standard for a Rule 6(e)(3)(G) Transfer is Not Met 
In the alternative, even if the Government made an argument for an exception under Rule 
6(e)(3)(E) that is recognized in this Circuit such that the Government could potentially seek a 
transfer under Rule 6(e)(3)(G), which the Government has not, Rule 6(e)(3)(G) states: " If the 
petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court 
must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned court can reasonably 
determine whether disclosure is proper." (emphasis added). The Government's request does not 
meet either standard. 
Arising Out of a Judicial Proceeding 
The Government's request for transfer does not arise out of a judicial proceeding; the 
Government does not seek the disclosure of evidence for itself. Indeed, the Government provided 
the evidence sought to be unsealed with the Petition. Consistent with the fact that the Government 
does not need the evidence, it has not filed the Petition for the purpose of prosecuting4 the New 
York Federal Proceedings-the trial-level proceedings concluded years ago. Similarly, the 
4 The evidence is similarly not sought for the purpose of aiding a party's defense in the New York Federal Proceedings. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 10 of 12
Government has not filed the Petition because unsealing the evidence is necessary for the proper 
litigation of the New York Federal Proceedings. 
Instead, the specifics of the New York Federal Proceedings are absent from the Petition. 5 
This lack of information and discussion stands in stark contrast to cases where courts grant Rule 
6(e)(3)(G) requests for transfer. For example, in Lischewski, plaintiffs in an MDL asked a district 
court to unseal grand jury transcripts. 2023 WL 2600451, at * 1. Both the litigants and the court 
engaged in extensive discussion and analysis of the state of the litigation of the MDL, and how the 
transcripts would be used in the MDL. Id. at *1-*3. Because the district court had doubt about its 
ability to understand all of the nuances and history of the MDL, the district court transferred the 
petition to the MDL. Id. at *8. 
At the root of cases such as Lischewski is the commonsense question to the movant: "Why 
do you need the evidence?" Based upon the answer, courts question whether they know enough 
about the destination court proceedings to rule. See Douglas Oil, 441 U.S. at 228. But in this 
Petition, the Government's request is not to assist with litigation in the New York Federal 
Proceedings. The Government wants the Petition to be granted so that it can release evidence to 
the public at large. The need to disclose renders the New York Federal Proceedings irrelevant. 
Such a circumstance strongly suggests that the Petition does not arise from the New York Federal 
Proceedings. 
Further, the text of the Petition sources the need for the Petition in the Government's recent 
public memorandum summarizing its investigation into Mr. Epstein. Pet. at 1 ("[T]he Department 
of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a memorandum describing an internal review 
5 The Government's briefing on the status of the New York Federal Proceedings is limited to informing the Court that 
it has filed what are almost identical petitions in the Southern District of New York. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 11 of 12
of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein.'"). Because that memorandum resulted in great 
public interest, the Government filed the instant Petition. Id. ("[T]here has been extensive public 
interest in the basis for the Memorandum's conclusions."). As such, the request to unseal arises 
from the Government's internal investigation, from its public statements about that investigation, 
and from great public interest in the investigation, but it does not arise from the New York Federal 
Proceedings themselves. The Government has not filed the Petition in response to a pleading, 
objection, strategy, or ruling in the New York Federal Proceedings, and it does not state that it will 
use the unsealed evidence in furtherance of any case-related objective-the trial proceedings have 
concluded. 
Whether the Court Can Determine if Disclosure is Proper 
This Court may transfer the Petition to another district only if it is unable to reasonably 
determine whether disclosure is proper. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e)(3)(G). By way of an example 
discussed above, the Lischewski court transferred a petition to unseal to an MDL because the 
Lischewski court was uncertain it could appreciate all of the nuances and history of the MDL. In 
contrast to cases such as Lischewski, this Court has already determined that the disclosure sought 
in this case would not be proper under clear Eleventh Circuit law; the Government has effectively 
conceded that the Court's hands are tied, but the Government wishes to preserve the issue for a 
potential appeal. See Part I; Pet. at 4. Pursuant to Pitch and for all of the reasons set forth above, 
this Court can determine whether disclosure is proper-it is not. The Government's request to 
transfer is therefore denied for all of the reasons set forth above. 
III. 
RULING 
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Petition is 
DENIED. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 12 of 12
It is FURTHER ORDERED that, as a matter of public interest, the Court directs the Clerk 
of Court to open a new miscellaneous case with the United States· Petition to Unseal Grand Jury 
Transcripts as the initiating document. The following filings and Orders shall be included: ( 1) the 
United States' Petition to Unseal Grand Jury Transcripts, filed on July 18, 2025; (2) the Court's 
Order Requiring Supplemental Briefing, issued on July 19, 2025; (3) the United States' Response 
to the Order on Supplemental Briefing, filed on July 20, 2025; and (4) this Order. Any transcripts 
or grand jury materials that have not been disclosed shall not be included on the docket. 
It is FURTHER ORDERED that, because the undersigned has been presiding over the 
United States' Petition to Unseal Grand Jury Transcripts that was filed as part of the grand jury 
docket, the case should be directly assigned to the undersigned. 
It is FURTHER ORDERED that, because the Government's Petition is denied, the Clerk 
of Court shall CLOSE THE CASE.
