privilege as equivalent to a specific denial.”).  See also 24 Fla.Jur.2d Evidence §592.
Defendants in civil actions. – “… a civil defendant who raises an affirmative defense is not

privilege.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
1.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and was a willing participant in the acts
alleged, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be reduced accordingly.
2.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and participated in conduct similar
and/or identical to the acts alleged with other persons which were the sole or contributing cause of
Plaintiff’s alleged damages.
3.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff impliedly consented to the acts alleged by not objecting, and
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 62   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2009   Page 5 of 9

6
therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be reduced accordingly.
4.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Defendant reasonably believed or was told that the Plaintiff had
attained the age of 18 years old at the time of the alleged acts.
5.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff’s claims are barred as she said she was 18 years or older at
the time.
6.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff’s alleged damages were caused in whole or part by events
and/or circumstances completely unrelated to the incident(s) alleged in the complaint. 
7.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
8.
Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and can not show a violation of
a predicate act under the applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) – the version in effect prior
to the 2006 amendment, effective July 27, 2006.
9.
As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time of the
alleged conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount should Plaintiff prove
the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any multiplier.
10.  As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, Plaintiff is entitled to only a single recovery of her actual
damages.  Should Plaintiff prove actual damages in an amount less than $50,000, the applicable
statutory minimum, she is entitled to a single recovery of $50,000, regardless of the number of acts.
Allowing a multiplication of the damages recoverable would be in violation of the prohibition against
the recovery of duplicative damages.
11. As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255,
effective July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against retroactive application of an
amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional principles, including but not limited to,
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 62   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2009   Page 6 of 9

the “Ex Post Facto” Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1,  and procedural and substantive
due process, U.S. Const. 14  Amend., 5  Amend.  The statute in effect during the time of the alleged
th
th
conduct applies.
12. As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255,
effective July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the Rule of Lenity.  A
criminal statute is required to give “ ‘fair warning ... in language that the common world will
understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far
as possible the line should be clear.’ “ United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137
L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816
(1931)) (omission in original).  The “three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement” are:
(1) the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of
an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and
differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity,
ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct
clearly covered; (3) due process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute
to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its
scope.
13. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of a “minor.”
Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and accordingly, her cause
of action is barred.
14. Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in violation of the
constitutional principles of due process, the “Ex Post Facto” clause, and the Rule of Lenity, in that
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 62   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2009   Page 7 of 9

8
in amending the term “minor” to “person” as to those who may bring a cause of action impermissibly
and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of persons able to bring a §2255 claim.
15.  18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14  Amendment under the U.S.
th
Constitution, and thus Plaintiff’s claim thereunder is barred.
16.   18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and substantive due
process.  Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be deprived of life, liberty or
property without notice and opportunity to be heard.  Substantive due process protects fundamental
rights.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s cause of action thereunder is barred.
WHEREFORE Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief sought by Plaintiff.
