Dear Judge Freeman:  
Pursuant to the Court’s request at the November 21, 2019, Case Management Conference, 
Plaintiffs and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, jointly submit this letter to provide the Court with an update as to the progress 
of discussions regarding both discovery and settlement. 
The parties have thus far engaged in two productive conferences pursuant to Rule 26(f) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  During those conferences, the parties agreed to exchange 
initial disclosures by January 23, 2020, and to exchange discovery plans one week thereafter, on 
January 30, 2020.   
As the Court is aware, Defendants have arranged for a Victims’ Compensation Program 
that will be available to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has conferred with the Program’s designers 
and administrators, the Program’s administrators provided Plaintiffs with a proposed protocol for 
the Program, and Plaintiffs have provided some feedback to the administrators.  The motion for 
the Superior Court of the United States Virgin Islands to approve the establishment of the Program 
will be heard on February 4, 2020.  
The parties request a conference with the Court on February 6 or 7, 2020, to resolve any 
potential disagreements as to how these matters should proceed.  The parties will provide the Court 
with their proposed discovery plan(s) 48 hours before any such conference.
