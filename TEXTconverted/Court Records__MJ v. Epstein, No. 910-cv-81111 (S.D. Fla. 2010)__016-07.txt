PLAINTIFF JANE DOE'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR A HEARING, FINDING THAT 
EPSTEIN 15 IN CIVIL CONTEMPT OF THE COURT'S TWO ORDERS FORBIDDING 
HARASSMENT AND INDIRECT CONTACT, FOR APPROPRIATE SANCTIONS AND 
ADDITIONAL REMEDIES INCLUDING REFERRAL FOR CRIMINAL CONTEMPT 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, through undersigned counsel, hereby files this emergency 
motion for a hearing and for an immediate finding that Epstein stands in civil contempt 
of Judge Marra's order forbidding indirect contact with Jane Doe and Judge Palermo's 
order forbidding harassment of Jane Doe. Jane Doe asks for this Court for remedies 
and sanctions to provide for her safety and to insure that Epstein follows this Court's 
orders (and an order of the state court), including a referral to the U.S. Attorney's Office 
for prosecution of criminal contempt. 
To put the matter bluntly, defendant Epstein is intimidating Jane Doe in violation 
of three judicial no-contact orders. Last evening, he had a "private investigator'' tail 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 2 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Jane Doe - following her every move, stopping when she stopped, driving when she 
drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove to her 
home, the "private investigator" then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane 
Doe's house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home. 
Even more 
threateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of 
retired police officer employed by Jane Doe's counsel, the "private investigator" 
attempted to follow Jane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer was 
successfully able to take evasive action and has placed Jane Doe in a secure, 
undisclosed location last night. 
Other harassing actions against Jane Doe also 
occurred yesterday. 
Given the circumstances of this case, it is obvious that intimidation from the 
"private investigator'' was instigated by billionaire Epstein. Epstein thus stands in clear 
violation of two, separate orders from this Court, one long-standing and one entered 
yesterday. First, a year ago, this Court stated that it ''finds it necessary to state clearly 
that Defendant is under this court's order not to have direct or indirect contact with any 
plaintiffs .... " Order, Case no. 9:08-cv-80119, doc. #238 at 4-5 (emphasis added). 
Second, on top of this order, yesterday this Court entered another order directing Jane 
Doe and Epstein "not to communicate, speak or harass one another in any way." 
Order, Case no. 9:08-cv-80893, doc. #193 at 2 (emphasis added). 
Epstein's intimidation-by-surrogate also violates a no-contact order entered 
during the course of his guilty pleas on June 30, 2008, before Palm Beach Circuit Court 
Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo, who ordered Epstein "not to have any contact, direct or

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 3 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
indirect" with any victims. She also expressly stated that her no-contact order applied to 
"all of the victims." 
To protect her safety and to insure respect for court orders, Jane's Doe's counsel 
accordingly request, on an emergency basis: 
First, the Court should schedule an emergency hearing today, either in court or 
via telephone, to consider whether Epstein stands in civil contempt of the Court's 
orders; 
Second, the Court should find that Epstein stands in civil contempt of two 
separate orders of this Court; 
Third, the Court should then hear from Jane Doe directly and impose such civil 
contempt sanctions as it finds will enable Jane Doe to return safely to her home or other 
place of safety without facing the threat of any further harassment or intimidation. 
Fourth, as part of the sanction for Epstein's civil contempt, the Court should 
expand its current protective order to forbid Epstein or his agents from having any 
contact whatsoever, direct or indirect, with Jane Doe, but also with any of her family 
members or friends, as well as with any persons who have been identified by Jane Doe 
as possible witnesses in her case, without first seeking specific approval of the Court. 
Fifth, the Court should direct Epstein's legal counsel to file with the Court in 
advance of the mediation on Tuesday morning a certification that they have explained to 
him the consequences of any additional violations of the courts orders.

CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Sixth, Epstein should be directed not to have any agents attempt to follow or 
surveil Jane Doe as she leaves the courthouse after the settlement conference on 
Tuesday or after any other court hearing; 
Seventh, this Court should initiate criminal contempt sanctions against Epstein 
for the violations of its two orders under Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a), by referring a criminal 
contempt action to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida; 
Eighth, the Court should also refer this matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida for investigation of possible criminal offenses, including 
witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b} as well as its position on violations 
of the conditions of Epstein's non-prosecution agreement; and 
Ninth, the Court should refer this matter to Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge 
Deborah Dale Pucillo's criminal division presiding over Epstein's probation for 
consideration by her of whether Epstein has violated her order as well. 
Tenth, the Court should refer this matter to Epstein's probation officer for 
determination of any violations of his probation. 
Eleventh, the Court should request that Epstein pay a fine to Jane Doe's counsel 
in the amount of $18,000 to cover any and all costs associated with relocating Jane Doe 
and keeping her safe through her trial date. 
Because Epstein's blatant defiance of this Court no-harassment order appears to 
be designed by him to intimidate not only Jane Doe but also other witnesses in the case 
(i.e., other young girls that he sexually abused), Jane Doe is filing this Emergency 
Motion Under Seal.

CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
BACKGROUND 
Counsel for Jane Doe proffer the following facts as officers of the Court. They 
proffer that they could prove these facts at any evidentiary hearing which the Court 
might decide to hold. Counsel for Jane Doe further represent to this Court that they 
have a genuine concern about the physical safety of their client. 
Facts Leading Up to the Entry of Three Protective Orders 
The Court is familiar with the general circumstances of this case, which involves 
Jane Doe's lawsuit seeking significant compensatory and punitive damages from 
billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. The Court is also aware that Epstein has pied guilty to state 
sex charges on June 30, 2008. 
When he pied guilty before Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale 
Pucillo, she ordered Epstein "not to have any contact, direct or indirect" with any victims. 
She also expressly stated that her no-contact order applied to "all of the victims." The 
relevant transcripts have been filed with this Court. (See case no. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM, 
doc. #113 at 3 and exhibits thereto.) 
To avoid any uncertainty about the scope of this state court order, several of the 
plaintiff/victims with suits pending against Epstein before this Court filed a motion for an 
order prohibiting defendant or his agents from communicating with them directly or 
indirectly. (Case No. 9:08-cv-80119, doc. #113.) Epstein opposed these requests as 
"needless, unwarranted and excessive." 
Doc. #127 at 5. This Court, however, firmly 
overruled Epstein's objections. On July 31, 2009, this Court entered its own no-contact 
order (in addition to the state court order), ruling: 
5 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 6 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
In light of Defendant's response to Plaintiff's motion for no contact order, 
suggesting that the state court's order only applies to some victims and 
that parties are always allowed to contact each other directly, the Court 
finds it necessary to state clearly that Defendant is under this court's order 
not to have direct or indirect contact with any plaintiffs, regardless of the 
intended scope of the state court court's order. 
Order, Doc. #238, at 4-5 (emphasis added). 
Recently, with the case nearing trial, the Court ordered Jane Doe to attend a 
settlement conference on July 6, 2010. Jane Doe had concerns that the upcoming 
settlement conference, demanded by Epstein, was going to be used to harass and 
intimidate her. See Plaintiff Jane Doe's Motion for Modification of Magistrate Judge 
Palermo's Order Schedule settlement Conference, doc. #187. After a response from 
Epstein (doc. #191 ), the Court modified its order regarding the settlement conference to 
avoid harassment of Jane Doe. Significantly, in the final paragraph, the Court (Palermo, 
J.). starkly commanded: 
The parties are instructed not to communicate, speak or harass one 
another in any way. Any violation of this Order will not be tolerated. The 
parties are instructed to GOVERN THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY. 
Case no. 9:08-cv-80893, Doc. #193 at 2 (italic added, capitalization in original). This 
Order was entered at 3:29 p.m., EDT, according to the PACER message sent to 
counsel in the case. 
Intimidating Activities on the Evening of July 1, 2010 
In spite of three court orders forbidding contact and harassment of Jane Doe, 
Epstein has (once again 1) shown his unwillingness to follow the rules. On the evening 
1 For two other examples of Epstein's unwillingness to follow the same rules that apply to other 
litigants, see Plaintiff's Motion in Limine to Prevent Improper Use of the 5th Amendment, doc.

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 7 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
of July 1, 2010, sometime after the issuance of this Court's most recent order, Jane Doe 
left her house to go to the store and noticed a car (lnfiniti SUV, license tag T-KNOLZ) 
following her everywhere she went. Feeling frightened, she pulled into a driveway in a 
nearby neighborhood at one point to allow the car to proceed past her, but the car 
pulled into the neighborhood and stopped nearby. It was clear the person in the car 
was following her and was intentionally making his presence known. Jane Doe pulled 
out of the driveway and headed home, with this other car tailing close behind. Once 
Jane Doe arrived to her house, she went inside and the person following in the lnfiniti 
parked across the street outside her home. Jane Doe called her attorney expressing 
her fear and asking what could be done to protect her. She observed that the car kept 
creeping closer to her home every once in awhile. 
This intimidation of Jane Doe was so serious that, alerted by Jane Doe's counsel, 
a retired police officer called the police. The police responded to Jane Doe's home and 
confronted the man in the car. 
The man told the police that he was "private 
investigator." However he would not tell the police who had hired him, only that he was 
hired to "watch" Jane Doe. The name of the investigator appears to be Thaddeus 
Knowles. The police reported these facts to Jane Doe, but advised her that they did not 
have a legal basis to order him to leave the public street. (The police are also preparing 
a report on the incident.) 
Counsel for Jane Doe then arranged for the retired police officer to go to Jane 
Doe's home. This retired officer arrived at Jane Doe's home at approximately 10 p.m. 
#178 (recounting Epstein's misuse of the Fifth Amendment during his deposition); doc. #190 
(recounting Epstein's willful violations of discovery orders). 
7 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 8 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
He immediately saw a car parked 25 feet from Jane Doe's home, facing her home. He 
also observed the purported "private investigator" in the car intermittently flashing his 
high beam lights into Jane Doe's home. 
The investigator was also intermittently 
attempting to videotape anyone inside the home. 
The retired police officer took 
videotapes of the investigator lighting up the interior of the home with his high beam 
lights, and also took photographs of this harassing action as well. 
The videotape and 
photographs could be provided quickly to the Court upon request. 
After consulting with Jane Doe, the retired police officer determined that Jane 
Doe felt like a prisoner in her own home and that she believed her physical safety and 
that of her family was threatened if she remained there. She further believed that this 
intimidation was being orchestrated by defendant Epstein. Jane Doe is not involved in 
other litigation and is not aware of any other person who would want to do something 
like this to her. Also, in the last 48 hours, Jane Doe has received telephone calls from 
two ex-boyfriends that investigators were at their homes, knocking on their doors and 
trying to talk to them about Jane Doe - apparently because of this case. 
And, of 
course, Jane Doe's settlement conference is just four days away and her trial is two-
and-half-weeks away. 
In light of Jane Doe's concerns, the retired police officer believed that it was best 
to take Jane Doe from her home. He advised Jane Doe to pack a suitcase and leave 
the home with him. 
At approximately 10:30 p.m., the retired police officer then took Jane Doe in his 
car and pulled up next to the "private investigator." The retired police officer advised the

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 9 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
investigator that Jane Doe was leaving the home to go to another location and that he 
should not attempt to follow them. Nonetheless, the investigator attempted to follow the 
retired police officer as they drove away from Jane Doe's home. The retired police 
officer then took evasive action and was able to elude his pursuer. 
As a result of these activities, Jane Doe feels very threatened. She knows that 
she was followed for much of the day. She also know that this was not surreptitious 
surveillance by someone who was trying to discovery something about her, but rather 
quite visible surveillance by someone whose manifest intent was to make she that Jane 
Doe knew she was being followed. Thus, when she pulled over, he pulled over; when 
she parked, he parked visibly close by. The only reason for such activities could be to 
intimidate her on the eve of the court-ordered mediation. It may also be worth noting 
that Jane Doe is a petite young woman, physically smaller and younger than the male 
private investigator who has been following her. 
Past Intimidation of Witnesses By Epstein 
The Court should be aware that this is not the first time Epstein has used scare 
tactics to intimidate witnesses. Indeed, as the Court is aware, despite numerous civil 
suits being filed against Epstein for sexual abuse, none of the victims in those cases 
have felt able to proceed to trial. Counsel for Jane Doe have been advised that many of 
these victims were afraid to take their cases all the way to trial. Jane Doe remains one 
of only three victims who has had the temerity not to settle her case against Epstein but 
stand on her right to a jury trial.

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 10 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
In determining who is responsible for the intimidation that took place last night, 
this Court can consider all of the circumstances, including other documented examples 
of harassment by Epstein:2 
Previous use of ''investigators" to scare witnesses: The use of "investigators" to 
aggressively harass his victims is not new to Epstein, as investigators have in the past 
aggressively followed key witnesses to intimidate and scare them. See Palm Beach 
Police Department Incident Report at p. 86 (Attached as Exhibit A). 
Victim-to-victim communication: 
One of Epstein's sexual abuse victims was 
relayed a message from another victim speaking on Epstein's behalf regarding the 
criminal investigation of Epstein in 2006: "Those who help will be compensated and 
those who hurt will be dealt with." See Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report, 
Id. at page 83. 
Witness tampering during the federal investigation: During the FBI investigation 
of his sexual abuse of young girls, Epstein intimidated and harassed other possible 
witnesses against him -- namely Sarah Kellen, and Nadia Marcinkova. 
Indeed, this 
intimidation was so serious that federal prosecutors prepared draft federal charges 
against him for witness tampering charges. 
(Attached as Composite Exhibit B) 
Ultimately, for reasons that are unclear, these charges were not filed. 
Threats Against Jane Doe 102: 
Epstein has even tracked down adverse 
witnesses as far away as Australia in the past to send the message not to testify against 
2 The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to this motion and, in any event, the federal rules 
authorize the Court to consider other bad acts in reaching a conclusion about disputed events. 
See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).

CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
him regarding his illegal sexual exploits. See Complaint of Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein 
(attached as Exhibit C) 
Threats Against Alfredo Rodriguez: Jane Doe is not the only person to have 
received this impression that she is at risk if she does not accede to Epstein's demands. 
The Court is familiar with Alfredo Rodriguez, an employee of Epstein who kept a "black 
book" of the names of minor girls Epstein' was sexually abusing. 
See Criminal 
Complaint, U.S. v. Rodriguez, No. 9:10-CR-80015-KAM (doc. #3). Rodriguez stated 
that he was afraid that Jeffrey Epstein would make him "disappear" unless he had an 
"insurance policy" (i.e., the black book). Id. at 3. 
Please find, for the Court's consideration as well Exhibit D, the affidavit of the 
retired officer that assisted in protecting Jane Doe. 
The Court can consider all of this information as circumstantial evidence pointing 
to only one conclusion: that defendant Epstein is trying to intimidate Jane Doe before 
her upcoming settlement conference and trial. This is clear violation of the three court 
orders outlined above. 
THE COURT SHOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE 
VIOLATION OF ITS ORDERS AND TO ALER THE STATE COURT TO A POSSIBLE 
VIOLATION OF ITS ORDER 
Defendant Epstein is thumbing his nose at three separate court orders, two from 
this Court and one from the state court. The threatening message billionaire Epstein is 
trying to send to Jane Doe is obvious: settle this case next week or you are in danger. 
This is not the way in which a civil case should be litigated. The Court should not allow 
defendant Epstein's wealth to be deployed to pervert the course of justice. 
In entering 
11 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 12 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
its most recent no harassment order, Judge Palermo indicated that "[a]ny violation of 
this Order will not be tolerated." 
Jane Doe respectfully requests that the Court carry 
through on this promise and make it possible for her to return safely to her home. 
Jane Doe accordingly requests the following actions on an emergency basis: 
First, the Court should schedule an emergency hearing today, July 2, 2010, 
either in court or via telephone with counsel for Jane Doe and Epstein to learn whether 
Epstein will challenge any of the foregoing facts and the conclusion that he stands in 
civil contempt of this Court's orders and, if so, how to resolve those factual questions 
rapidly. As part of that hearing, counsel for Epstein should proffer whether Epstein will 
deny that he instigated the harassment that took place last night and answer questions 
about his involvement or whether instead he will refuse to answer such questions on 
grounds that they might incriminate him.3 The Court should thereafter conduct such 
further fact-finding as it deems necessary to reach a conclusion about whether Epstein 
has violated the Court's orders, giving both Jane Doe and Epstein an opportunity to be 
heard. 
Second, the Court should find that Epstein stands in civil contempt of two 
separate orders of this Court: (1) Judge Marra's long-standing direction "that Defendant 
is under this court's order not to have direct or indirect contact with any plaintiffs," Order, 
case no. 9:08-cv-808119, doc. #238, at 4-5 (emphasis added), and (2) Judge Palermo's 
3 If, as Jane Doe suggests, the Court ultimately proceeds first by way of civil and then only later 
by way of criminal contempt, Epstein would be entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment only in 
the later criminal contempt proceedings. See Romero v. Drummond Co., Inc., 480 F.3d 1234, 
1243 (11 th Cir. 2007) (noting that the right to remain silent attaches to criminal contempt 
proceedings). 
Of course, in any civil proceeding, the finder of fact can draw an adverse 
inference from an invocation of the Fifth Amendment. 
12 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 13 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
order yesterday that Jane Doe and Epstein "are instructed not to communicate, speak 
or harass one another in any way, Order, case no. 9:08-cv-80893, doc. #193, at 2 
Third, the Court should then impose such civil contempt sanctions as it finds, 
after the hearing, will enable Jane Doe to return safely to her home (or, if necessary, 
other place of safety) without facing the threat of any further harassment or intimidation. 
See Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 446 F.3d 1137, 1147 (11 th Cir. 2006) 
("Civil contempt may be imposed in an ordinary civil proceeding upon notice and an 
opportunity to be heard."). As part of that determination, plaintiff Jane Doe respectfully 
requests an opportunity to be heard directly by the Court (either in person or via 
telephone) so that the Court will have the benefit of her specific concerns in crafting 
appropriate sanctions and remedies to make her feel safe to return to her home and to 
prevent further intimidation at the hands of Epstein. 
Fourth, as part of the sanction for Epstein's civil contempt, the Court should 
expand its current protective order so that forbids Epstein or his agents from not only 
having any contact whatsoever, direct or indirect, with Jane Doe, but also with any of 
her family members or friends, as well as with any persons who have been identified by 
Jane Doe as possible witnesses in her case, without first seeking specific approval of 
the Court. 
Fifth, the Court should direct Epstein's legal counsel to file with the Court in 
advance of the mediation on Tuesday morning a certification that they have explained 
the requirements of all of these orders with him and have explained to him the serious 
consequences that could follow from of any additional violations of these orders. 
13 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 14 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Sixth, Epstein should be directed not to have any agents attempt to follow or 
surveil Jane Doe as she leaves the courthouse after the settlement conference on 
Tuesday or after any other court hearings or trial proceedings. 
Seventh, this Court should initiate criminal contempt sanctions against Epstein 
for the violations of its two orders - and provide notice to Epstein that the criminal 
sanctions could include a possible term of imprisonment. Criminal contempt sanctions 
are appropriate here because "the criminal contemnor has done that which he has been 
commanded not to do. The criminal contemnor's disobedience is past, a completed act, 
a deed no sanction can undo. Accordingly, the criminal sanction operates not to coerce 
a future act from the defendant for the benefit of the complainant, but to uphold the 
dignity of the law, by punishing the contemnor's disobedience." United Minor Workers 
of America v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821,845 (1994) (internal citations omitted). The dignity 
of the law needs to be upheld; this Court need to act to insure Epstein understands that, 
despite his vast wealth, he remains equal to everyone else in the eyes of the law. In 
short, this Court needs to stop Epstein from flouting its orders and intimidating Jane 
Doe; 
Because the contempt took place outside the presence of the Court, the Court 
should proceed in nonsummary fashion. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a); United States v. 
Baldwin, 770 F.2d 1550, 1553 (11 th Cir. 1985). The procedures for such nonsummary 
criminal contempt are well settled. As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, "A federal 
court may punish contemptuous conduct that occurs outside its presence only after 
giving notice of the essential facts constituting the charged criminal contempt, 
14 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-7   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 15 of 18
CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON 
requesting that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government, and 
affording other procedural protections." Romero v. Drummond Co., Inc., 480 F.3d 1234, 
1242-43 (11 th Cir. 2007). The Court should therefore begin the process by referring this 
matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida or, if that office 
declines to pursue the matter, such other attorney as may be appropriate. See Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 42(a)(2). 
Eighth, because Epstein's actions appear to implicate possible witness 
tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b), and possibly other federal offenses, the 
Court should additionally refer this matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida for a criminal investigation. 
Ninth, the Court should refer this matter to Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge 
Deborah Dale Pucillo's criminal division presiding over Epstein's criminal probation for 
consideration by her of whether Epstein has violated her order as well. 
Tenth, the Court should refer this matter to Epstein's probation officer for 
determination of any violations of his probation. 
Eleventh, the Court should request that Epstein pay a fine to Jane Doe's counsel 
in the amount of $18,000 to cover any and all costs associated with relocating Jane Doe 
and keeping her safe through her trial date. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court should hold a hearing on an emergency basis, find Epstein to be in 
contempt of the Court's orders, and impose sanctions and take other steps as outlined 
15

by Jane Doe to secure her safety and to permit her to return to her home without 
harassment by Epstein. 
We respectfully request this Court to seal this Motion and all responses be 
SEALED.
