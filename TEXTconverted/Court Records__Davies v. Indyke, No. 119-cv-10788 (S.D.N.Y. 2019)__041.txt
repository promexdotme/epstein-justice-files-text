Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
 
Your Honor: 
 
 
 
We represent the plaintiffs in the three above-referenced cases.  With 
the consent of Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), we write respectfully 
to request that the Court extend the current discovery deadlines in these three 
cases by ninety (90) days and the Co-Executors’ answer deadlines in the Jane Doe 
15 and Mary Doe matters by thirty (30) days. 
 
 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause substantial difficulties for 
all parties, and is inhibiting the parties’ ability to fully conduct discovery.  In 
addition, as Your Honor is aware, the parties are awaiting the approval by the 
Superior Court of the Virgin Islands of a voluntary claims resolution program.  If 
that program is approved in the near future and quickly implemented, the plaintiffs 
in these actions wish to participate in it, and the parties are hopeful that the 
program might resolve the plaintiffs’ claims.  As a result of this confluence of factors 
– the substantial challenges to the discovery process as a result of the pandemic and 
the possibility that the alternative dispute resolution mechanism may soon be 
available and speedy – the parties believe that the most appropriate and efficient 
course of action would be for the parties to enter into an informal stay of the three 
proceedings for thirty days, after which time the parties will evaluate the current 
status of both the pandemic-related limitations and the claims resolution program 
and consider whether an additional informal stay would be appropriate.  We will of 
course confer and write again to keep the Court apprised.  
 
In order to facilitate that informal stay while ensuring that the parties 
are not prejudiced in the discovery process if and when the litigation process

resumes, we ask the Court to extend the current discovery deadlines in these three 
cases, as set forth in the Court’s April 14, 2020 Endorsed Memorandum, by ninety 
(90) days, and to extend the Co-Executors’ answer deadlines in the Jane Doe 15 and 
Mary Doe matters by thirty (30) days as follows: 
 
• the deadline for the Co-Executors to file Answers in the Jane Doe 15 
and Mary Doe actions, which are currently due on May 12 and May 14, 
respectively, be extended to June 8, 2020;   
• the deadline for Plaintiffs to file any motions to amend the pleadings or 
to join any additional parties be extended from June 1, 2020 to August 
31, 2020; 
• the deadline for the Parties to submit joint status reports to the Court, 
regarding discovery and the progress of settlement discussions, be 
extended from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020; 
• the deadline for the completion of fact discovery be extended from July 
10, 2020 to October 8, 2020; 
• the deadline for service of Plaintiffs’ expert reports be extended from 
July 10, 2020 to October 8, 2020; 
• the deadline for service of the Co-Executors’ rebuttal reports be 
extended from August 10, 2020 to November 9, 2020; and 
• the deadline for the completion of expert discovery be extended from 
August 31, 2020 to November 30, 2020. 
 
The Court has granted one previous extension of the discovery 
deadlines, of thirty (30) days, on April 14, 2020.  The Co-Executors’ answer 
deadlines in the Jane Doe 15 and Mary Doe actions have not been extended since 
the Court ruled on the motions to dismiss in those actions. 
 
We appreciate the Court’s attention to these matters. 
 
Respectfully submitted,
