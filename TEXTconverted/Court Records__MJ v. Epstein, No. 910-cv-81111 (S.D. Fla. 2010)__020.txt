Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WPD 
_______________ / 
REPLY IN SUPPORT OF RENEWED MOTION OF DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
TO QUASH SERVICE OF PROCESS, RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S 
MOTION FOR A HEARING TO PROVE FRAUD, TO PROVE PROPER SERVICE, TO 
OBTAIN SANCTIONS FOR EPSTEIN'S SUBMISSION OF A FRAUDULENT 
AFFIDAVIT, TO OBTAIN A WARNING FORBIDDING FURTHER OBSTRUCTIONS 
IN THE CASES, AND TO SET AN ACCELERATED SCHEDULE FOR

Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submits the 
following: 1) reply in support of Motion to Quash Service of Process (D.E.7) and Renewed Motion 
to Quash (D.E.14); 2) response to Plaintiffs Motion for a Hearing to Prove Fraud, to Prove Proper 
Service, to Obtain Sanctions for Epstein's Submission of a Fraudulent Affidavit, to Obtain a 
Warning Forbidding Further Obstructions in the Cases, and to Set an Accelerated Schedule for 
Discovery (D.E. 15); and 3) motion to strike impertinent portions of Plaintiffs response, and states 
as follows: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Plaintiffs response to Mr. Epstein's motion and renewed motion to quash service of 
process attempts to distort the key issue before the Court with misstatements, misleading 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/22/2010   Page 2 of 12
Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
assertions, and scurrilous, unfounded and irrelevant allegations designed solely to smear Mr. 
Epstein and poison the well. The narrow threshold issue is whether substitute service was made 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(B); and not whether discovery misconduct occurred in prior 
litigation, as claimed by Plaintiff. Plaintiffs injection of unfounded and unproven charges of 
"obstruction of justice" because two witnesses refused to appear for depositions pushes the 
envelope of Rule 11, and should not be permitted. 
Plaintiffs bluster cannot obscure the fact that Plaintiff has not carried her burden of 
demonstrating that service of process was proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(B). Contrary to 
Plaintiffs contention, the issue is not whether "M. J. has left a copy of her complaint and other 
documents with someone at the home", which is all that Plaintiff alleges, or whether Mr. Epstein 
had actual notice (D.E. 15 at 12), but, rather, whether the suit papers were left with "someone of 
suitable age and discretion who resides" at 9 East 71st Street, New York. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
4(e)(2)(B). In view of the fact that Plaintiff has failed to show that "Mark", the alleged recipient 
of the suit papers, was of suitable age and discretion and resided at 9 East 71 st Street, New York, 
Mr. Epstein's motion to quash should be granted. 
There is no need for the Court to hold an evidentiary hearing because Plaintiff has not made 
a prima facie showing that so-called "Mark" was "someone of suitable age and discretion who 
resides" at 9 East 71 st Street. The affidavit of Thomas Marsigliano provides no description of 
"Mark", including Mark's age, other than to state that Mark was a white Male. It provides no 
indication whatsoever that Mr. Marsigliano even made any attempt to, or did in fact, determine, the 
relationship of"Mark" to Mr. Epstein or 9 East 71 st Street, or whether "Mark" resided at 9 East 71 st 
Street before allegedly delivering suit papers to "Mark". Accordingly, there is no factual dispute 
-2-

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/22/2010   Page 3 of 12
Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
and no need for an evidentiary hearing, particularly when the evidence indicates that no one 
resided on the premises on October 8, 2010. Assuming arguendo that the Court were to conduct 
an evidentiary hearing, there is certainly no need and indeed no valid reason for Mr. Epstein, who 
did not submit an affidavit, to testify. 
The Court should also deny Plaintiffs motion for Rule 11 sanctions based upon the 
submission of an allegedly fraudulent affidavit by Mr. Barnett. Plaintiff has not offered any 
probative evidence of fraud, relying solely on caustic rhetoric. Moreover, Plaintiff has violated the 
mandatory safe harbor requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, which violations require denial of her 
motion. 
In addition, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Court should establish an "expedited 
schedule" and cannot point to any exigent circumstances. Mr. Epstein's financial standing does 
not eradicate due process or the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P 26(f), as set forth in this Court's 
Order Requiring Counsel to Meet, File Joint Scheduling Report and Joint Discovery Report. (D.E. 
4) 
Finally, the Court should enter an Order striking all portions of Plaintiffs response, 
including the affidavit of Plaintiffs counsel, Brad Edwards, which allege, argue and purport to 
show an "obstruction of justice" in prior litigation. Such matters are patently irrelevant to the 
threshold issue of service of process in the instant case, are intended solely to smear Mr. Epstein 
and are unduly prejudicial. 
II. BACKGROUND 
1. 
Plaintiff claims that Mr. Epstein was served on October 8, 2010. Defendant filed a 
Motion to Quash Service of Process on October 29, 2010 (D.E.7), and a renewed motion to quash 
-3-

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/22/2010   Page 4 of 12
Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
on November 10, 2010. (D.E. 14) Plaintiff filed a response on November 11, 2010. (D.E. 15). 
2. 
The Proof of Service filed by Plaintiff (D.E. 11) states that the process server left 
the summons at Mr. Epstein's 
residence or usual place of abode with Mark, a 
person of suitable age and discretion who resides 
there, on Oct. 8, 20 I 0, and mailed a copy to the 
individual's last known address; 
The Proof of Service does not identify "Mark" or state that he is a caretaker ( as alleged by 
Plaintiff). (Id.). 
3. 
Thomas Marsigliano, the process server, stated in an affidavit dated November 5, 
2010, that on October 8, 2010, he knocked on the front door of 9 East 71 st Street, New York; a 
person named "Mark" opened the door and took the suit papers from him; and "Mark" appeared to 
have authority to accept service. (D.E. 15-2, '11'115 and 6). 
Mr. Marsigliano provided no 
description of"Mark" in his affidavit, other than to describe "Mark" as a white male. Nor did Mr. 
Marsigliano provide any indication whatsoever in his affidavit that "Mark" specifically advised 
Mr. Marsigliano or that Mr. Marsigliano specifically inquired of "Mark" as to any relationship 
between "Mark" and Mr. Epstein or between "Mark" and 9 East 71 st Street. According to Mr. 
Marsigliano's affidavit, based on a brief encounter with "Mark," without ever making any specific 
inquiries, and on Mr. Marsigliano's "observations," alone, it was somehow "obvious" to Mr. 
Marsigliano that ""Mark" was familiar with Jeffrey Epstein, had authority to answer the door of 
Mr. Epstein's residence and accept service for Mr. Epstein." Most importantly, Mr. Marsigliano 
provided no indication whatsoever in his affidavit that he asked, was told or even made any 
attempt to determine that "Mark" resided at 9 East 71 st Street, New York, New York. (Id.). Nor 
did Mr. Marsigliano state the time of day that he allegedly delivered the papers to "Mark". (Id.)

Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
4. 
Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence that "Mark" resided at 9 East 71 st Street, 
New York, New York or, indeed, that anyone else resided at that address on October 8, 2010. 
5. 
Richard Barnett, the property manager at 9 East 71 st Street, did not reside, and has 
never resided, at 9 East 71st Street. (Ex. A). On October 8, 2010, no individual resided at that 
address. (Id.). Mr. Epstein was not present at 9 East 71 st Street on October 8, 2010. (Id.). 
6. 
Plaintiff asserts that "Epstein's counsel admit they have received proof of service 
from Mr. Marsigliano attesting that he left M.J. 's complaint with the caretaker at Epstein's 
residence or usual place of abode." (D.E. 15 at p. 11 ). This assertion is false. Defendant has 
never admitted that the proof of service states that Mr. Marsigliano left the Summons and 
Complaint with "the caretaker" and, more importantly, Mr. Marsigliano, himself, has never 
attested to leaving the papers with a "caretaker." 
7. 
Plaintiff asserts that "Epstein concedes the materials were left at his "vacation 
home." (Id.) This assertion is misleading. Mr. Barnett's affidavit states only that the suit papers 
were discovered in the mailbox at 9 East 71 st Street, New York, New York. (D.E. 7) 
8. 
Paragraphs 14-22 of Plaintiffs "Factual Background" contain allegations 
regarding a "Pattern of Obstruction in Other Similar Cases Against Him," based largely on the 
affidavit of Brad Edwards, Plaintiffs counsel, submitted in the instant case. (See D.E. 15, ,r,r 
14-22 and D.E. 15-1). As set forth below, these allegations, as well as Mr. Edwards' affidavit in 
support of same, a purported "message" to Mr. Epstein, and a Motion for an Order to Show Cause 
in another case (D.E. 15-1, D.E. 15-3 and D.E.- 4 respectively) should all be stricken. They 
pertain to witnesses and depositions in prior litigation, are entirely irrelevant to the motion to 
quash, and were filed for an improper purpose.

Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
III. ARGUMENT 
A. PLAINTIFF DID NOT EFFECT SUBSTITUTE SERVICE 
ON MR. EPSTEIN PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 4(e)(2)(B) 
AND HAS NOT CARRIED HER BURDEN OF PROVING 
THAT THERE WAS VALID SERVICE 
Plaintiff has tacitly conceded that no service was made on Mr. Epstein in New York 
pursuant to Florida or New York law.1 Plaintiff has not carried her burden of establishing that 
service was effected on Mr. Epstein pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(B), which permits 
substitute service only if the Summons and Complaint are left at the defendant's "dwelling or usual 
place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there." (Emphasis added) 
See, e.g., Trovarello v. McMonagle, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18529, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 16, 1998) 
("Once the sufficiency of service of process is challenged, the party on whose service was made 
bears the burden of establishing the validity of service."). 
Although Plaintiff claims that service was proper merely because the papers were left with 
an individual named "Mark" at Mr. Epstein's house (D.E. 15 at 12), Plaintiff has not carried her 
burden of making a prima facie showing that the suit papers were left with someone of suitable age 
and discretion who resided at 9 East 71 st Street on October 8, 2010, as clearly required by Rule 
4(a)(2)(B). 
Significantly, Plaintiff's response, and the November 5, 2010 affidavit of Mr. 
Marsigliano, are totally silent on this essential requirement. Plaintiffs failure to submit any 
probative evidence that "Mark" or anyone else resided at 9 East 71st Street on October 8, 2010, 
alone requires that service of process be quashed. This conclusion is further supported by the 
supplemental affidavit of Mr. Barnett in which he stated that on October 8, 2010, no one resided at 
1Plaintiffhas not refuted Mr. Epstein's argument that service was not effected pursuant to 
Florida or New York law. Accordingly, the only issue on the table, as Plaintiff has conceded, is 
whether substitute service was effected pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(B). (See D.E. 15, ,r 8). 
-6-

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/22/2010   Page 7 of 12
Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
Mr. Epstein's vacation home in New York. Given the fact that no one resided at 9 East 71 st Street 
on the date on question, service of process must be quashed. See, e.g., Trovarello, 1998 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 18529, at *2-3 ("Numerous cases make clear that when service is made by leaving copies 
of the summons and complaint "with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing 
therein," the person with whom the papers are left must actually be a resident of defendant's home, 
and not merely present at the time of service."); Hardy v. Kaszycki & Sons Contractors, Inc., 842 
F. Supp. 713, 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)(service on recipient under former Rule 4(d)(l)(now Rule 4(e)) 
was insufficient where nothing indicated that recipient resided in defendant's apartment); Franklin 
America, Inc. v. Franklin Cast Prods., Inc., 94 F.R.D. 645, 647 (E.D. Mich. 1982) (Rule 4(d)(l) 
requires the recipient to live in the same place as the party to be served). 
As in Trovallero, in which service was quashed where the plaintiff presented "no 
evidence that Maureen was a resident of Defendant McAleer' s home or an adult person in charge 
who could accept service of process on his behalf," 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18529, at *5, service of 
process in the instant case is likewise invalid because Plaintiff has not presented evidence of 
"Mark's" age, or his relationship to Mr. Epstein or 9 East 71 st Street, New York, New York, or that 
"Mark" was a resident of 9 East 71 st Street, New York, New York. 
B. 
THERE IS NO NEED TO HOLD AN EVIDENTIARY 
HEARING 
Plaintiff argues (D .E. 15 at 9-10) that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to resolve a 
factual dispute as to whether a representative of Mr. Epstein was served, and seeks permission to 
question Mr. Marsigliano, Mr. Barnett and Mr. Epstein at the hearing. 
Defendant submits that 
no evidentiary hearing is necessary because, as previously demonstrated, Plaintiff has not made a 
prima facie showing that Mr. Marsigliano served a person of suitable age and discretion who 
-7-

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/22/2010   Page 8 of 12
Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
resided at 9 East 71 st Street, New York. Absent a factual dispute, there is no need for an 
evidentiary hearing. 
Should the Court conclude that an evidentiary hearing is required, then there is certainly no 
reason to require Mr. Epstein to testify at such a hearing. Mr. Epstein has not submitted an 
affidavit in this case and Plaintiff has not shown any legitimate reason for him to testify at a 
hearing on service of process. Plaintiff's baseless contention (D.E. 15 at 10) that Mr. Epstein 
should be permitted to testify to his involvement in "orchestrating" a false statement by Mr. 
Barnett demonstrates the outrageous lengths to which Plaintiff will go to poison the well and 
attempt to deflect the Court's attention from the substantive service issues. Unsubstantiated 
allegations regarding witnesses or discovery conduct in prior proceedings not involving this 
Plaintiff are patently irrelevant to the issues presented here. Moreover, evidence of other "crimes, 
wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in 
conformity therewith." Fed. R. Evid. 404(b ). Plaintiff should not be permitted to examine Mr. 
Epstein at an evidentiary hearing in order to inject collateral and highly impertinent matters. 
C. 
ACTUAL 
NOTICE 
DOES 
NOT 
OBVIATE 
COMPLIANCE WITH FED. R. CIV. P. 4 
Although Plaintiff contends that Rule 4 should be liberally construed when there has been 
actual notice (D.E. 15 at 12), Plaintiff cites no case which holds that service is deemed proper 
under Rule 4(a)(2)(B) absent proof that the suit papers were delivered to an individual of suitable 
age and discretion residing at the defendant's house, as explicitly required by the rule. This is not 
a matter of mere technical non-compliance. Actual notice cannot be used to override the basic 
requirements of Rule 4( e )(2)(B). As the Eleventh Circuit has noted, "actual notice of a suit does 
not dispose of the requirements of service of process." Jackson v. Warden, FCC Coleman-USP, 
-8-

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/22/2010   Page 9 of 12
Case No. 9:10-cv-81111-WP 
259 Fed. Appx 181, 182 n.2 (11th Cir. 2007). See also Precision Etchings & Findings v. LGP 
Gem, 953 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1992)("The federal courts have made it abundantly clear that actual 
notice itself, without more, is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 
4(d)(l))(now 4(e)(2)(B)"). 
D. 
NO BASIS FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS ON MR. 
EPSTEIN 
Citing Fed. R. Civ. P 11, Plaintiff seeks to impose sanctions on Mr Epstein on the ground 
that he is responsible for the filing of a knowingly false affidavit by Mr. Barnett. Plaintiffs 
baseless motion for sanctions is improper, if not itself sanctionable. Plaintiff has not offered even 
a scintilla of evidence that Mr. Barnett submitted a knowingly false affidavit, and has levied such 
scurrilous charges merely to harass Mr. Epstein and obfuscate the issues. 
In addition, Plaintiff has violated Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 l(c)(2) by not filing a separate motion 
for sanctions after giving the Defendant twenty-one (21) days in which to respond to the 
allegations. Non-compliance with the mandatory safe harbor provisions of Rule 11 mandates 
denial of the motion. See, e.g., Olmsted v. Defosset, 205 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1334 (M.D. Fla. 
2002). 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs motion for sanctions should be stricken or denied. 
E. 
NO EXPEDITED SCHEDULE IS NEEDED 
Plaintiff has offered no valid reason for expediting the proceedings in this case. There are 
no exigent circumstances which justify an accelerated schedule. The Court should address 
scheduling matters after review of the parties Joint Scheduling Report.

IV. 
THE COURT SHOULD STRIKE PARAGRAPHS 14-22 
OF PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE AND EXHIBITS 1,3 AND 4 
THERETO 
Mr. Epstein hereby moves to strike paragraphs 14-22 of the "Factual Background" of 
Plaintiffs response, as well as Exhibits 1, 3 and 4 thereto (see D.E. 15 at pp. 6-9, D.E.15- 1, 3 and 
4) on the grounds that Plaintiffs allegations, the affidavit from Plaintiffs counsel pertaining to 
witnesses and depositions in prior litigation involving Mr. Epstein, and Motion for Order to Show 
Cause submitted in prior litigation were submitted in the instant case solely to harass the 
Defendant and create a tempest in a teapot.2 Conduct involving two witnesses in prior litigation, 
neither of whom is Richard Barnett, is patently irrelevant to the narrow, threshold issue of whether 
substitute service was properly made in the instant case, and should not be considered by the 
Court.3 Accordingly, Defendant's motion to strike should be granted. 
V. CONCLUSION 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully requests that service of process be 
quashed, that Plaintiff's motion be denied in all respects, that portions of Plaintiff's response be 
stricken as set forth hereinabove, and that the Court grant such other and further relief as deemed 
necessary and proper. 
2Plaintiff s counsel, Brad Edwards, submitted his own two-page single-spaced affidavit in 
which he stated inter alia that: 1) in prior litigation two business associates and friends of Mr. 
Epstein allegedly avoided having their depositions taken; 2) in prior litigation, Mr. Epstein 
allegedly invoked his right against self-incrimination; and 3) in prior litigation, Mr. Epstein 
allegedly failed to produce certain correspondence with the United States government. (See D.E. 
15-1). It is impossible to fathom how any of this is even remotely relevant to the issue of whether 
substitute service was properly made on Mr. Epstein in the instant case. 
3Should the Court not strike these portions of Plaintiffs submission with respect to alleged 
misconduct in prior litigation, Mr. Epstein would request an opportunity to respond to the 
allegations on the merits.
