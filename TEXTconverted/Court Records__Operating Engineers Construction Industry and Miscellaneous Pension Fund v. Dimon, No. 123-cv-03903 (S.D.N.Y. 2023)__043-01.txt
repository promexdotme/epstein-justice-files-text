Rev. 5/23/14 
Ruby J. Krajick 
Clerk of Court 
Dear Litigant: 
Enclosed is a copy of the judgment entered in your case. If you disagree with a judgment or 
final order of the district court, you may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit. To start this process, file a “Notice of Appeal” with this Court’s Pro Se 
Intake Unit.  
You must file your notice of appeal in this Court within 30 days after the judgment or order 
that you wish to appeal is entered on the Court’s docket, or, if the United States or its officer 
or agency is a party, within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order. If you are unable 
to file your notice of appeal within the required time, you may make a motion for extension 
of time, but you must do so within 60 days from the date of entry of the judgment, or 
within 90 days if the United States or its officer or agency is a party, and you must show 
excusable neglect or good cause for your inability to file the notice of appeal by the 
deadline. 
Please note that the notice of appeal is a one-page document containing your name, a 
description of the final order or judgment (or part thereof) being appealed, and the name of 
the court to which the appeal is taken (the Second Circuit) – it does not include your reasons 
or grounds for the appeal. Once your appeal is processed by the district court, your notice 
of appeal will be sent to the Court of Appeals and a Court of Appeals docket number will 
be assigned to your case. At that point, all further questions regarding your appeal must be 
directed to that court. 
The filing fee for a notice of appeal is $605 payable in cash, by bank check, certified check, 
or money order, to “Clerk of Court, S.D.N.Y.” No personal checks are accepted.  Please see 
District Court fee schedule at https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/programs/fees. If you are 
unable to pay the $605 filing fee, complete the “Motion to Proceed in Forma Pauperis on 
Appeal” form and submit it with your notice of appeal to the Pro Se Intake Unit. If the 
district court denies your motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, or has certified 
under 28 U.S.C. ' 1915(a)(3) that an appeal would not be taken in good faith, you may file a 
motion in the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, but you must do so 
within 30 days after service of the district court order that stated that you could not 
proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. 
For additional issues regarding the time for filing a notice of appeal, see Federal Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 4(a). There are many other steps to beginning and proceeding with 
your appeal, but they are governed by the rules of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and 
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. For more information, visit the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals website at http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/.
