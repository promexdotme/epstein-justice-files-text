L.M., 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No.: __________ _ 
I 
--------------
MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
FILED by 
VT 
D.C. 
ELECTRONIC 
STEVEN M. LARIMORE 
CLERK U.S. DIST. CT. 
S. 0. OF FLA. • MIAMI 
Plaintiff, L.M., hereby moves this Court to enter an Order granting Plaintiff permission 
to proceed in this action under the pseudonym "L.M." and as grounds would state as follows: 
1. 
L.M. is currently a 20-year-old female. 
2. 
As outlined in detail in the Complaint, the Plaintiff, L.M., was sexually abused 
by the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, when she was very young, between the ages of 14 and 17 
years old. 
3. 
The abuse caused much embarrassment, humiliation, and psychological 
trauma for the Plaintiff, L.M .. 
4. 
This embarrassment, humiliation and psychological trauma would be greatly 
exacerbated if her name was revealed publicly as the subject of the alleged abuse. 
5. 
The subject matter of the Complaint clearly contains highly sensitive and 
intimate information about the Plaintiff, L.M .. 
6. 
Plaintiff, L.M., was an identified victim by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office in a 
criminal investigation against the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein.

7. 
During the criminal investigation, and up and through this point in time, Plaintiff, 
L.M.'s identity has been sealed, as all parties recognize the highly sensitive subject matter of 
the charges and the need to protect the privacy interest of the Plaintiff, L.M.'s true identity. 
8. 
The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, has been provided in the past with the true 
identity of Plaintiff, L.M .. 
9. 
In this civil action, the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, will be provided with Plaintiff, 
L.M.'s true identity; therefore, he will know the identity of Plaintiff, L.M., and will not be 
prejudiced by the non-disclosure of L.M.'s true identity in pleadings. 
10. 
There is a great need, in this case, to protect intimate information about 
Plaintiff, L.M., and to protect her privacy interest. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Despite the general presumption against anonymous or pseudonymous pleadings, it is 
common for this presumption to be overcome in certain types of cases, and courts have 
discretion to permit such pleading in appropriate circumstances. See Doe v. Del Rio, 241 
F.R.D. 154, 157 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (citing James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 238 (4th Cir. 1993)). 
The courts typically grant such requests for pseudonymity in matters of a sensitive and highly 
personal nature. Id at 157 (citing Heather K. v. City of Mallard, 887 F.Supp.1249, 1255 
(N.D.lowa 1995)). 
In deciding whether to permit pseudonymous pleadings, courts must 
balance "the Plaintiff's right to privacy and security against the public's interest in 
identification of the litigants and the harm to the defendant stemming from suppression of 
Plaintiff's name." Doe v. Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). The ultimate test for 
permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the plaintiff has a substantial privacy

right which outweighs the customary presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. Free 
Speech v. Reno, 1999 WL 47310, at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 1999). In undertaking this balance, 
courts typically consider such factors as whether the plaintiff would be compelled to disclose 
intimate information, whether the plaintiff would be compelled to admit her intention to 
engage in illegal conduct, whether the plaintiff would risk injury if identified, whether the party 
defending the suit would be prejudiced by the non-disclosure of the plaintiffs name, the age 
of the plaintiff whose identity is being suppressed, the extent to which the identity of the 
plaintiff has been kept confidential, as well as the interest the public has in knowing the 
names of the litigants. 241 FRO at 157. 
The Supreme Court has implicitly recognized pseudonyms in abortion cases, with 
minimal discussion. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 120-121, 93 S.Ct. 705 (1973); See also, 
E.E.O.C. v. ABM Industries, Inc., 249 F.R.D. 588 (E.D. Cal. 2008). Likewise, pseudonym 
filing is typically accepted by the courts in other cases where the nature of the pleading 
unveils highly sensitive information and detail about the plaintiff, such that the non-disclosure 
of the party's name is necessary to protect her from harassment, injury, ridicule, or personal 
embarrassment. Does v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-1068 (9th Cir. 2000) 
(citing United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920; E.E.O.C., 249 F.R.D. at 588). 
In this case, it is clear from the allegations in the Complaint that the information is of a 
highly sensitive nature - i.e., allegations involving sexual abuse of a minor. Additionally, 
Jane Doe's name was kept anonymous in the Federal Court criminal case and all documents 
containing her name were redacted by the United States Government and Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein's attorney. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, will not be prejudiced in any way by this 
pseudonym pleading, as he has been provided with her name in the past and will also be

privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiff, L.M. 's name. While the public does have a 
right to the openness of judicial proceedings, the right to know the true identity of Plaintiff, 
L.M., is greatly outweighed by L.M.'s privacy interest in this case. Of course, other than the 
identity of the then minor, all other aspects of the case will still be available to the public. 
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, L.M., moves this Court to enter an Order granting this 
Motion, and thus allowing her to proceed in this litigation under the L.M. pseudonym.
