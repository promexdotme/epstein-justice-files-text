NOLLE PROSEQUI 
19 Cr . 4 9 0 (RMB) 
1. 
The filing of this nolle prosequi will dispose of 
this case with respect to JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant. 
2. 
On 
July 2, 
2019, 
Indictment 
19 
Cr. 
490 
(the 
"Indictment") 
was 
returned, 
charging 
JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, 
the 
defendant, with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking 
of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex 
trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. 
3. 
On or about August 10, 
2019, 
while the above-
captioned case was pending, but prior to any trial or other 
disposition, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died. 
4. 
Because JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died while 
this case was pending, and therefore before a final judgment was 
issued, 
the Indictment must be dismissed under the rule of 
abatement. See United States v. Wright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 
1998) .
