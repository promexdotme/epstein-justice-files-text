has hOt been arrested for any crime since release; the roqoostod retief complios with the 
provisions of the foderat Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other 
fooeral standards applicable to the removal of r~istration requirements for a soxuat offondor 
or r~uirod to be met as·a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state; and tho c,:,urt

de,»srtm®t that such designation, if not imposed by a court, has boon removed by operation of 
law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was mado, and providc>d 
such person no longer meats the criteria for registration as a sexual offonde,r under the laws of

(12) The Leaislature finds that sexual offenders, especially those who have committed offoosas 
against minors, often pose a high risk of ongaefne in sexual offooses own after beina retoasod 
from incarceration or commitment and that protection of the public from sexual offenders is a 
paritmount government interest. Sexual offenders haw a reduced expectation of privacy 
bec11r..e of the public's fnterost in public safety and in the offective operation of uuvernment.
