or control of the defendant as of the date of this order and that is relevant to these cases or that 
may lead to the discovery of evidence relevant to these cases. The duty to preserve evidence 
extends to documents, data, and tangible things in the possession, custody, and/or control of

attorneys who possess materials reasonably anticipated to be subject to discovery in these 
actions. Counsel for the Defendant shall be directly responsible only to the extent they are in 
possession or control of evidence. Counsel shall provide a copy of this Order to the Defendant 
and to those employees or agents whom defense counsel knows or has reason to believe may

categories of evidence need not be preserved as otherwise required by this Order. If such 
agreement is reached, such agreement is effective upon signing and without further order of this
