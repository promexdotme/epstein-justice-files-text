any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials. 
At this time, the Parties have no proposed changes to the limitations on discovery 
imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
With the exception of the protective order mentioned above, the Parties are not currently 
aware of any other orders that the Court should issue under Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b)
