PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT KELLEN’S
MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
Plaintiff, JANE DOE II, through counsel, opposes the Defendant SARAH KELLEN’S
Motion to Set Aside Default. Defendant KELLEN offers no proof that she did not actually
receive the service of process; she says she “contests” the efforts but offers no evidence
to contest the Affidavit of the process server, who made six (6) attempts to serve before
being forced to resort to “nail and mail” service, valid under New York law. Maines Paper
& Food Service, Inc. v. Boulevard Burgers Corporation, 52 A.D. 3d 1150, 861 N.Y.S. 2d 808
(N.Y.S.C., Appellate Division, June 26, 2008).   
Defendant KELLEN first argues that Plaintiff’s Motion is defective because the
Plaintiff did not timely file the Affidavit of Service. However, a delay in filing proof of service
under CPLR 308 is merely a procedural irregularity, not jurisdictional, and may be corrected
nunc pro tunc by the court. Haegeland v Massa, 75 A.D. 2d 864; Hudela v Posner, 70 Misc
2d 726. If anything, the delay in filing the Affidavit of Service provided Defendant KELLEN
additional time to avoid being defaulted. An action is commenced with the delivery of a

summons, and cannot thereafter be defeated simply by reason of a belated filing of proof
of service.  Lopez v Quickset Printers, 70 Misc 2d 732, particularly in the absence of a
statement by defendant categorically denying that she ever received the papers.  Empire
Nat. Bank v Judal Constr., 61 A.D. 2d 789. Defendant KELLEN serves no Affidavit
contesting that she was served and received the Summons and Complaint.
Defendant makes a half hearted attempt to question the sufficiency of service.
Conspicuously absent is any statement or inference that the defendant did not receive the
papers served upon her or that, under New York State law, due diligence  was not made.
Schwarz v Margie, 2009 NY Slip Op 03890, 62 A.D.3d 780 (May 12, 2009); Leviton v
Unger, 2008 NY Slip Op 09363, 56 A.D. 3d 731 (November 25, 2008). Here, the Defendant
was given notice through proper service that a law suit was being instituted against her and
she deliberately chose to ignore the claim, not moving for relief until after a default was
entered. Even if the Defendant where to deny that she received service, which she has
failed to do, the presumption of receipt of properly mailed materials renders ineffective
defendant’s denial of receipt. Guccione v. Flynt, 618 F.Supp. (S.D. N.Y. 1985). Defendant
ultimately does not challenge the sufficiency of service with any evidence that might require
an evidentiary hearing.  
The second argument made by Defendant KELLEN, that the Court prematurely
defaulted her without waiting 10 days from Plaintiff’s filing proof of service, is equally
unavailing. New York State law requirements of filing an affidavit of service within 20 days
of completion under CPLR 308(4), along with the 10 grace period , pertains solely to the
time within which a defendant must answer, and does not relate to the jurisdiction acquired
by service of the summons.  Browning v Nix, 47 Misc 2d 709; William Iser, Inc. v. Garnett,
46 Misc 2d 450. The “additional notice” of 10 days is intended to give the defendant notice

that  a default judgment is imminent so that she may take remedial action is she desires.
(See 4 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3215:29) as cited in Mobil Oil Corp. v.
Christian Oil & Gas Distributors, 95 A.D. 2d 722; 463 N.Y.S. 2d 253 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983).
Defendant has been on notice for almost three months that a default was imminent, and
took no action; she then, through counsel, served a Motion to Set Aside Default, on June
23, 2009, and has still failed to file a responsive pleading of any kind, despite admitting that
such a pleading would have been due, under her reading of the Rule, on or before June 26,
2009. Hence under the facts of the instant case, service is proper, the defendant was on
notice of default and, even to date, has not responded to the allegations of the Complaint
sh was served with on April 23, 2009, almost three (3) months ago.    
In addition, under New York law, the moving party seeking to set aside a default,
must demonstrate a meritorious defense. Maines Paper, supra, 52 A.D. 3d at 1152. No
such argument is made here, no proposed Answer and Affirmative Defenses has been filed,
in fact there is nothing in the Motion to suggest that Defendant KELLEN even has a defense
to the claims made against her. Accordingly, denial of a Motion to Vacate Default would not
be an abuse of discretion. “Given defendant’s failure to present proof of a meritorious
defense, [the] Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to vacate
the default judgment,” Maines Paper, supra, 52 A.D. 3d at 1152 (citation omitted).    
In this case, Defendant KELLEN chose to ignore service of a summons for several
months, and sought relief after the Court had defaulted her. Defendant KELLEN is not
entitled to relief because her Motion is not supported by any case law interpreting New
York’s “nail and mail” statute and because she has not come forth with a meritorious, or any
defense. The Default should stand and the issue of damages reserved for trial or summary
