On March 15, 2005, The victim, a 14 year old female, reported to the Palm Beach Police Department 
that she was brought to 358 El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach, Jeffrey Epstein's house for the purpose of engaging in 
sexual activity with to Epstein. This arrangement was organized by Haley Robson.

Robson had offered the victim an opportunity to make good money. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein. 
During a sworn taped statement, the victim stated, on February 6, 2005, Haley Robson came to the 
victims house and picked the victim up. During the drive to Palm Beach, Robson told the victim that should "Jeff. 
ask her for her age, to state she was eighteen. Upon arriving at the house at 358 El Brillo they were allowed 
entry into the house. The victim was introduced to Epstein and was led upstairs to the bedroom area. Once 
inside the bedroom, the victim was instructed to wait for Epstein. Shortly thereafter, Epstein entered the 
bedroom wearing only a towel. Epstein instructed the victim to massage his back and laid naked on the massage 
table in his bedroom dropping the towel he had on. As the victim, began to massage Epstein on his back area, 
Epstein instructed her to remove her clothing. The victim, removed her clothing, remaining only in her bra and 
thong underwear. Epstein laid on the table naked and further told her to get up on his back to massage his back. 
The victim straddled his waist and massaged his back. The victim advised her buttocks were touching his 
buttocks. 
Epstein turned over on his back, the victim was now standing beside him, and she massaged his chest . 
Epstein began masturbating himself while she rubbed his chest. The victim stated that as she was rubbing his 
chest, Epstein produced a purple vibrator and began to massage the victims vagina area with the vibrator. The

Epstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars. 
Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was 
waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage. 
Robson stated "I know" and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein. 
The victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein's picture placed in position five. The victim 
immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated 
simultaneously. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the 
Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 
561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The 
victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the 
more you get paid." 
Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified, 
and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the 
victim's name at 11 :00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at 
Epstein's house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail. 
It should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the 
house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which 
Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate. 
During the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach. 
Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our 
arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to 
Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time 
she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she 
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein. 
Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend "Molly" in the Canopy 
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

She was told she would have to provide a massage and would make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer 
and agreed to meet with Jeffrey. Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) Picked her up 
and was taken to Epstein's house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of 
the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main 
bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein's bedroom . Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with 
a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and 
informed her Jeff would be in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He laid on the table onto 
his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated "He tried 
to touch me and I stopped him." I asked how did he tried to touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt 
uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told 
Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At 
the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I know you're not 
comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once 
tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson was asked how 
many girls did she brin in total to E stein. Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she 
brough 
JS, Y L 
and the victim in this case. 
I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim was the youngest. Robson 
stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a 
massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if the victim was aware. She stated every girl 
she brought knew what to expect. 
She explained she knew the victim wanted to make money . She 
approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The victim agreed and arrangements were 
made to bring the victim to Epstein's house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and -
(Later identified as

through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein's assistant Sarah. The victim was introduced

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within 
the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson 
made the comment" I'm like a Heidi Fliess". (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in 
California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident. 
On November 7, 2005, I made contact with 
at her home. During a sworn taped 
statement-
tated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson wou~ch females who 
wished to work for him. -
stated she was offered to work for him but declined. ~
xplained that 
"work" means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no. 
said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein's house to provide massages. 
further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl 
was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked. 
It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the 
request, just to tell him and he would stop.-
stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought 
over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared t~ungest, she replied, the victim, 
..., 
stated she looked really young, fifteen years old at the most.--further stated she did not know 
the victim personally.-
stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson. 
As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and 
based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts 
to a victim under the age of 16.

RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
The top donations to gov. elect Bill 
Richardson's campaign came from : 
1. Labor unions: $633,488 
The top union donor was AFSCME, 
the public-employee's labor group, 
which gave $300,000 in cash 
contributions. AFSCME also produced 
its own radio and television ads 
during the Republican primary that 
were critical of GOP candidates. 
AFSCME is angling to persuade the 
Legislature and the governor to 
reinstate collective bargaining for 
state employees. Outgoing Gov. 
Gary Johnson allowed the previous 
agreement to expire, and Richardson 
has promised to work on a new 
agreement. 
The Communication Workers of 
America, which represents several 
thousand employees in New Mexico, 
contributed $100,000 through its 
political action committee in New 
Mexico. The American Federation of 
Teachers, one of two national 
teachers unions that represents New 
Mexico educators, gave $50,000. 
2. Gambling interests: $648,392 
This is a significant development in 
New Mexico campaign finances. In a 
matter of five years, gambling 
money has become one of the top 
influences in state politics. 
The top gambling contributor was 
the Downs at Albuquerque, which 
donated $100,000. 
The Downs has a relationship with 
the state because the racing license 
is regulated by the state Racing 
Commission. The Downs also

operates a casino that is regulated 
by the state Gaming Control Board. 
The Downs also rents the racetrack 
and casino facilities from the New 
Mexico State Fair. The state recently 
sued the Downs on behalf of the 
State Fair for more than $100,000 in 
back rent that has not been paid. 
Paul Blanchard, the president of the 
Downs, was a key player in helping 
Richardson raise campaign money. 
He donated $10,000 of his own 
money. Blanchard's wife, Kandace, 
also donated $10,000. 
Other major gambling contributors 
include Riviera Gaming Management 
Inc., a Las Vegas corporation that is 
working with partners in New 
Mexico, including Ken Newton, to get 
a license to open a horse racetrack 
and casino in Hobbs. Riviera donated 
$50,000 to Richardson's campaign. 
The Pueblo of Sandia contributed 
$56,148 in cash and in-kind 
donations to Richardson. Sandia 
operates the state's largest tribal 
casino. 
3. Democratic organizations: 
$490,751 
The Democratic Governors 
Association chipped in $427,500 to 
help elect Richardson. That amount 
was minor compared with the money 
the DGA funneled to gubernatorial 
candidates in more competitive 
races. 
Nevertheless, the association was 
counting on Richardson, who was 
one of a half-dozen candidates who 
helped Democrats take control in 
states where Republicans had been 
chief executives. 
Now, the DGA is turning to 
Richardson to serve as its top 
federal liaison. The former 
congressman and cabinet member 
will speak for Democratic governors 
during negotiations with the White

House and Congress on issues that 
affect states. 
Richardson also attracted $51,000 
from the New Democrat Network, a 
political group that embraces 
centrist Democrats. 
Richardson also received $12,751 in 
cash from the state Democratic 
Party, although he contributed 
$350,000 from his account to help 
the party's coordinated campaign to 
elect Democrats. 
4. Richardson's congressional 
account: $289,315 
Richardson transferred all of the 
money from the bank account he 
previously used for his congressional 
campaigns in the state's 3rd 
Congressional District in northern 
New Mexico. 
Richardson had fought in court in 
the early 1990s for the right to 
transfer money from a federal 
campaign account to a state 
account, even though the state 
constitution bans the practice. The 
state Supreme Court ruled that the 
constitutional provision violated the 
federal constitution. 
5. Peters Corporation: $138,376 
Gerald Peters, owner of the Peters 
Gallery in Santa Fe, is a close friend 
of Richardson. 
In addition to $102,000 in cash 
contributions donated to the 
campaign, Peters also flew 
Richardson in his private plane 
during several campaign swings 
around the state. He also provided 
food and beverages for an event and 
donated art. Those in-kind 
contributions amounted to $35,000 
in aid.

Univision: $116,667

Robson had offered the victim an opportunity to make good money. "Jeff' was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein. 
During a sworn taped statement, the victim stated, on February 6, 2005, Haley Robson came to the 
victims house and picked the victim up. During the drive to Palm Beach, Robson told the victim that should "Jeff· 
ask her for her age, to state she was eighteen. Upon arriving at the house at 358 El Brillo they were allowed 
entry into the house. The victim was introduced to Epstein and was led upstairs to the bedroom area. Once 
inside the bedroom, the victim was instructed to wait for Epstein. Shortly thereafter, Epstein entered the

Epstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars. 
Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was 
waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage. 
Robson stated "I know" and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein. 
The victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein's picture placed in position five. The victim 
immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated 
simultaneously. 
During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the 
Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 
561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The 
victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, "the more you do, the 
more you get paid." Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified, 
and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the 
victim's name at 11 :00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at 
Epstein's house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail. 
It should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the 
house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which 
Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate. 
During the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach. 
Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our 
arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to 
Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time 
she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she 
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein. 
Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend "Molly" in the Canopy 
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within 
the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson 
made the comment" I'm like a Heidi Fliess". (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in 
California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident. 
On November 7, 2005, I made contact wit-t 
her home. During a sworn taped 
statemen-stated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson wo~ch females who 
wished to work for him_,tated she was offered to work for him but declined.-explained that 
"work" means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no. 
said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein's house to provide massages. 
further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl 
was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked. 
It was also told that should Epstein requir~nything extra, and they were not comfortable with the 
request, just to tell him and he would sto~tated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought 
over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim, 
~tated she looked reall young, fifteen years old at the most. ...iturther stated she did not know 
the victim personally 
stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson. 
As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and 
based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts 
to a victim under the age of 16.

RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
The top donations to gov. elect Bill 
Richardson's campaign came from : 
1. Labor unions: $633,488 
The top union donor was AFSCME, 
the public-employee's labor group, 
which gave $300,000 in cash 
contributions. AFSCME also produced 
its own radio and television ads 
during the Republican primary that 
were critical of GOP candidates. 
AFSCME is angling to persuade the 
Legislature and the governor to 
reinstate collective bargaining for 
state employees. Outgoing Gov. 
Gary Johnson allowed the previous 
agreement to expire, and Richardson 
has promised to work on a new 
agreement. 
The Communication Workers of 
America, which represents several 
thousand employees in New Mexico, 
contributed $100,000 through its 
political action committee in New 
Mexico. The American Federation of 
Teachers, one of two national 
teachers unions that represents New 
Mexico educators, gave $50,000. 
2. Gambling interests: $648,392 
This is a significant development in 
New Mexico campaign finances. In a 
matter of five years, gambling 
money has become one of the top 
influences in state politics. 
The top gambling contributor was 
the Downs at Albuquerque, which 
donated $100,000. 
The Downs has a relationship with 
the state because the racing license 
is regulated by the state Racing 
Commission. The Downs also

operates a casino that is regulated 
by the state Gaming Control Board. 
The Downs also rents the racetrack 
and casino facilities from the New 
Mexico State Fair. The state recently 
sued the Downs on behalf of the 
State Fair for more than $100,000 in 
back rent that has not been paid. 
Paul Blanchard, the president of the 
Downs, was a key player in helping 
Richardson raise campaign money. 
He donated $10,000 of his own 
money. Blanchard's wife, Kandace, 
also donated $10,000. 
Other major gambling contributors 
include Riviera Gaming Management 
Inc., a Las Vegas corporation that is 
working with partners in New 
Mexico, including Ken Newton, to get 
a license to open a horse racetrack 
and casino in Hobbs. Riviera donated 
$50,000 to Richardson's campaign. 
The Pueblo of Sandia contributed 
$56,148 in cash and in-kind 
donations to Richardson. Sandia 
operates the state's largest tribal 
casino. 
3. Democratic organizations: 
$490,751 
The Democratic Governors 
Association chipped in $427,500 to 
help elect Richardson. That amount 
was minor compared with the money 
the DGA funneled to gubernatorial 
candidates in more competitive 
races. 
Nevertheless, the association was 
counting on Richardson, who was 
one of a half-dozen candidates who 
helped Democrats take control in 
states where Republicans had been 
chief executives. 
Now, the DGA is turning to 
Richardson to serve as its top 
federal liaison. The former 
congressman and cabinet member 
will speak for Democratic governors 
during negotiations with the White

House and Congress on issues that 
affect states. 
Richardson also attracted $51,000 
from the New Democrat Network, a 
political group that embraces 
centrist Democrats. 
Richardson also received $12,751 in 
cash from the state Democratic 
Party, although he contributed 
$350,000 from his account to help 
the party's coordinated campaign to 
elect Democrats. 
4. Richardson's congressional 
account: $289,315 
Richardson transferred all of the 
money from the bank account he 
previously used for his congressional 
campaigns in the state's 3rd 
Congressional District in northern 
New Mexico. 
Richardson had fought in court in 
the early 1990s for the right to 
transfer money from a federal 
campaign account to a state 
account, even though the state 
constitution bans the practice. The 
state Supreme Court ruled that the 
constitutional provision violated the 
federal constitution. 
5. Peters Corporation: $138,376 
Gerald Peters, owner of the Peters 
Gallery in Santa Fe, is a close friend 
of Richardson. 
In addition to $102,000 in cash 
contributions donated to the 
campaign, Peters also flew 
Richardson in his private plane 
during several campaign swings 
around the state. He also provided 
food and beverages for an event and 
donated art. Those in-kind 
contributions amounted to $35,000 
in aid. 
6. Jerry Perenchio, president of 
Univision: $116,667 
Perenchio founded Univision, the 
Spanish-language lV network that 
broadcasts throughout the United

States. He also owns Chartwell 
Partners, a Los Angeles investment 
company. 
Perenchio has actively supported 
candidates, mostly in California. He 
gave at least $200,000 to California 
Gov. Gray Davis during this election 
cycle. He also gave money to 
national Republican Congressional 
Committees and made smaller 
donations to Democratic 
congressional candidates. 
Richardson has known Perenchio 
since his days in Congress. 
7. Maloof family: $87,417 
The high-profile New Mexico family, 
known for its support of Democratic 
candidates and causes, put its 
financial backing behind Richardson. 
The Joe G. Maloof Company, the 
family's liquor business, pitched in 
$30,000. Gavin Maloof donated 
$40,000. 
Family matriarch Colleen Maloof 
used her Albuquerque home and 
catered a fund-raising event - to the 
tune of $15,917 - on Richardson's 
behalf. Former Vice President Al 
Gore was the featured guest at the 
event. 
The Maloofs own the Sacramento 
Kings basketball team and the Palms 
Casino and Resort in Las Vegas, 
Nev. 
The Maloofs also donated a $1,500 
trip to its Las Vegas resort as an 
auction item that Richardson used 
during a fund-raising event. 
8. BGK Equities III LLC: $50,000 
The Santa Fe real estate company is 
one of the largest commercial firms 
in the state. 
Among its clients are state agencies, 
which lease office space from BGK.

The Albuquerque real estate 
company is owned by James 
Peterson of Peterson Properties Real 
Estate Services Inc. 
Cap II leases properties to 
companies such as Walgreens Drug 
Stores Inc. 
10. Jeffrey E. Epstein: $50,000 
The New York City financier, who 
owns a ranch near Stanley, 
supported Richardson's campaign in 
New Mexico. 
Epstein heads J. Epstein & Co., a 
Manhattan money-management 
company. He built a mansion on the 
100,000-acre Zorro Ranch he 
bought from former Gov. Bruce 
King's family in 1993.
