Greetings from Tallahassee 
Current mood: 0 peaceful 
I made it! I'm at 
I love it here. My dorm is so 
big and nice, compared to most of the other dorms 
on campus. I've been going to class now for three 
weeks and I love it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing 
quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in 
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in 
love with 
The weather, most of the time is 
perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is 
visiting and I am so excited. Fm goinna show him all 
over. We're going to have the best time! Hopefully, 
everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this 
pace I'll have a descent chance at the dean's list. 
OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss 
everyone! XOXO

Current mood: (-) exhausted 
Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes 
So, I am officially a "college gal." The past two days 
have been incredibly stressful. I've been so busy; all 
I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm 
yesterday but I still have alot of stuff to buy to make 
it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is awesome. 
There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky 
enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal 
with and the room is a decent size so I can have 
privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, 
however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going 
on, 	
 I miss Will,....I guess he misses me, but who 
knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not used to falling asleep by 
myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked 
women on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not,

but atleast it feels like it right now. I don't know how 
I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. 
Anyway, I finished orientation today. It was s00000 
boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all 
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when 
registration opens and go on the computer and finish 
applying for classes because for some reason that 
shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My 
INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it 
this morning at 3am because I had to register today 
and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last 
minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME

again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY 
WEEDiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  la's° want to get a 
vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because 
apparently there are 'narcs' everywhere. Well, I'm 
really excited about starting class and meeting 
people. If you've read to this point then I feel bad for 
you. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up, 	
 
hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry 
to those of you I promised to hang out with but 
couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so 
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch 
to all of those who know me. Wish me luck!

guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to 
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I 
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He 
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote 
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into 
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and 
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a 
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so 
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. 
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to.

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for

packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making 
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so 
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't 
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I 
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to 
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u 
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling

Current mood: 5° pissed off 
I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at 
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me 
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the 
way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on 
EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I 
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and 
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I 
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much 
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more 
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is 
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!!!!!!

I made it! I'm at 
I love it here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of 
the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love 
it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in 
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with 
The weather, 
most of the time is perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I 
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over. We're going to have the best time! 
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a 
descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss 
everyone! XOXO - "'

awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only 
have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy 
too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's 
going on, 	
 I miss 	guess he misses me, but who knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not 
used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women 
on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I 
don't know how I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished 
orientation today. It was s00000 boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all 
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the 
computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be 
open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it 
this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted 
to do. I'm so last minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME 
WEEDliiiililiiiiiliiliiiiiiiiiiiiiil  I CAN'TWAITIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII (Hold On: Let me say 
that again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY WEEDI  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I also want to get a 
vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs' 
everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If 
you've read to this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this 
thing up, 	
 I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you 
I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so 
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me. 
Wish me luck!

I am s00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My 
neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was s00000000000 cool! There was 400 
bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes 
all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and 
went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to 
promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing 
there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving 
it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had 
two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to 
let everyone know what I was up to. Bye!

soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not 
having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem 
like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through 
this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20

hey, 
halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up going to a party. our makeup was 
awesome. i only have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have more. the one i 
have up is of us after the make-up had been on for hours, 	
it started to peel off in 
the pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found a red pitbull puppy a few 
days ago. i wrote a bulletin about her but i forgot to add that she is s000000 good 
with children. i have an 18 month old living with me and she is just s0000 nice to 
him. she loves to play with him and has not shown one sign of agression. even with 
another dog that is bigger than her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i 
want to keep her s0000 bad, i just can't tho. someone please take her! 	
I and 
provide her with a good homeloll thank u. <3

Re: 	
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Lanna: 
Thank you for giving Mr. Epstein the opportunity to present information to 
the Grand Jury. Enclosed please find background information on 
and her family. 
You will find the enclosed information presents M
s someone 
who is untruthful, sexually active, smokes marijuana, drinks alcohol, and 
shoplifts regularly. Additionally, the information reveals the motive behind 
the false allegations. 
Based on Ms. 
 lack of credibility, we request that you reconsider 
your decision to present this matter to the Grand Jury. In support of this 
request, it is important to acknowledge that Mr. Epstein does not use drugs
