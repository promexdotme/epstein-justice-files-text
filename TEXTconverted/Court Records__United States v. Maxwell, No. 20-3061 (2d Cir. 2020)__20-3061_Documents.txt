7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
Case 20-3061, Document 1-2, 09/09/2020, 2927741, Page13 of 19

proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
Case 20-3061, Document 1-2, 09/09/2020, 2927741, Page14 of 19

the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

36 PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
Case 20-3061, Document 1-2, 09/09/2020, 2927741, Page17 of 19

District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
 
 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 
On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed letter motion seeking 
an Order modifying the protective order in this case.1  Specifically, she sought a Court order 
allowing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that 
she received in discovery from the Government in this case.  She also sought permission to 
 
1 This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.  
The Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion that the Government proposed on 
August 21, 2020, and it will enter that version into the public docket.  The Court’s decision to adopt the 
Government’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the 
documents in question are “judicial documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to 
the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access.  Id. at 119-20.  “Such 
countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’ 
and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 
1048 (2d Cir.1995) (“Amodeo II”)).  The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test.  First, the Court finds 
that the defendant’s letter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test.  United 
States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).  Second, the Court assumes that the common law 
presumption of access attaches, thereby satisfying the second element.  But in balancing competing considerations 
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including, 
most notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury 
investigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrowly tailored redactions.   
 
In light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to 
the Defendant’s reply letter, dated August 24, 2020 and the Defendant’s August 24, 2020 letter addressing her 
proposed redactions to the Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion.  The parties are further ORDERED to submit 
their proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions, 
they shall submit a joint letter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.

reference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.  For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.   
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), a Court may enter a protective order 
only after it finds that good cause exists.  Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing 
protective order is warranted.2  To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant 
factors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has 
sufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant matter.   
On July 30, 2020, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined 
that good cause existed.  Dkt. No. 36.  The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.  
See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating 
to the proposed protective order.”).  The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a 
provision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and 
not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.”  Dkt. No. 29, 
Ex. A ¶ 1(a).  That language was included in the Court’s July 30, 2020 protective order.  See Dkt. 
No. 36 ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a).  Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery. 
Upon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which 
seeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal 
 
2 In the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.”  In re Teligent, 
Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for 
modification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context.  See, e.g., United States v. Calderon, 
No. 3:15-CR-25 (JCH), 2017 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017) (applying the civil standard for the 
modification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. 07-CR-1027 (LAP), 2014 WL 
12710346 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (same).  See also United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (applying the standard for “good cause” in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective 
order entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 2007) (same).

case in other civil proceedings.  She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the 
Documents to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of issues being litigated in those civil matters.  But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated 
rhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to 
why that is the case.  She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to 
make before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in 
this criminal matter under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.  And she 
furnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be 
made in those matters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order 
to allow such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those matters.  In sum, the 
arguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause.  The 
Defendant’s request is DENIED on this basis. 
Indeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further 
lacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the 
judicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the 
Government’s docketed letter on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  In the opening paragraph of her 
reply letter dated August 24, 2020, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose 
under seal to certain judicial officers the following factual information:  
1.  Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government 
opened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-
conspirators;  
2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand 
jury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;

Case 20-3061, Document 2, 09/09/2020, 2927750, Page3 of 5

3. In February 2019, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of 
those civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury 
subpoenas;  
4. In April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) permitted the modification and, subsequently, 
another court (“Court-2”) did not;  
5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-1, the 
Recipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by 
the protective order; and  
6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of 
Rule 16 discovery in this criminal matter.   
With the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil 
matters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the letter 
filed on the public docket by the Government on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  Although this 
Court remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that 
those courts can make their own determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by 
the protective order in this matter, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the 
relevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the 
relevant judicial decision makers and civil matters. 
In addition, the Government has indicated that “there is no impediment to counsel 
making sealed applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant 
materials.”  Dkt. No. 46 at 3 n.5.  In her reply, the Defendant asserts that she is amenable to such 
a solution if the Court agrees with the Government that doing so would not contravene the 
protective order in this case.  To the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by the protective

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
Case 20-3061, Document 5-2, 09/09/2020, 2927755, Page6 of 12

proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
Case 20-3061, Document 5-2, 09/09/2020, 2927755, Page7 of 12

the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

36 PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
Case 20-3061, Document 5-2, 09/09/2020, 2927755, Page10 of 12

District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

20-3061 
 
United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Plaintiff-Appellee, 
—against— 
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
 
 
ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, 20-CR-330 (AJN) 
 
 
Unopposed Motion to File Unredacted Motion to Consolidate 
Under Seal 
 
 
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell, through her attorneys Haddon, 
Morgan and Foreman, P.C., moves unopposed for leave to file her Unredacted 
Motion to Consolidate under seal. As grounds for this request, Ms. Maxwell states: 
Ms. Maxwell has filed with this Court a motion to consolidate two appeals: 
United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-3061 (the “criminal case,” Case No. 20-CR-330 
(AJN) (S.D.N.Y.)), and Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413 (the “civil case,” 
Case No. 15-CV-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.)). The criminal case addresses an order by 
Case 20-3061, Document 16, 09/10/2020, 2928287, Page2 of 5

 
2 
Judge Nathan refusing to modify a criminal protective order. The civil case  
addresses an order by Judge Preska unsealing certain deposition material. 
Among other arguments for consolidation of the two appeals, Ms. Maxwell 
contends that she should be permitted to share with Judge Preska critical 
information Ms. Maxwell learned from Judge Nathan.  
But the protective order issued by Judge Nathan prevents Ms. Maxwell from 
disclosing this information to Judge Preska or from telling this Court about the 
information in the civil appeal. By contrast, the protective order allows Ms. 
Maxwell to tell this Court about the information in the criminal appeal, though only 
under seal since it is confidential and sealed in the district court criminal case. 
Ms. Maxwell’s Unredacted Motion to Consolidate explains this situation 
and describes the critical information. But to comply with criminal protective 
order, Ms. Maxwell can file an unredacted copy of the Motion to Consolidate only 
under seal with this Court, and then only in the criminal appeal, Case No. 20-3061. 
Therefore, in compliance with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell 
will publicly file on ECF a redacted copy of the Motion to Consolidate in both 
appeals along with all but one of the exhibits—Exhibit B, which was filed under seal 
in the district court. 
Case 20-3061, Document 16, 09/10/2020, 2928287, Page3 of 5

In turn, she asks for leave to file the unredacted copy of the Motion to 
Consolidate in the criminal appeal under seal with this Court, along with Exhibit B. 
The government does not oppose this Motion for Leave to File under Seal, 
although it does oppose the Motion to Consolidate. 
For these reasons, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to file her Unredacted 
Motion to Consolidate under seal.

United States Court of Appeals 
for the Second Circuit 
 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
 
                               Plaintiff-Appellee,  
 
v.  
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 
                              Defendant- Appellant. 
On Appeal from the U.S. District 
Court for the Southern District of 
New York 
 
No. 15-CV-7433 (LAP) 
 
The Honorable Loretta A. Preska, 
U.S. District Judge 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
                               Plaintiff-Appellee, 
 
v.  
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
 
                              Defendant-Appellant. 
On Appeal from the U.S. District

No. 20-CR-330 (AJN) 
 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan, U.S. 
District Judge 
 
 
 
Ghislaine Maxwell’s Motion to Consolidate Appeals 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page2 of 15

 
2 
 
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell moves this Court to consolidate 
United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-3061 (the “criminal case,” Case No. 20-CR-330 
(AJN) (S.D.N.Y.)), with the pending appeal in Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-
2413 (the “civil case,” Case No. 15-CV-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.)).1  
Background 
These two appeals are inextricably intertwined. As Ms. Maxwell explained in 
her opening brief in the civil case, the district court unsealed the deposition 
material without knowing critical new information discovered to Ms. Maxwell in 
the criminal case bearing directly on whether the deposition material should be 
unsealed. Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413, OB, pp 13–15. 
 
 
 
1 Since Ms. Maxwell seeks to consolidate both appeals, she is filing this 
motion in both cases. But because of the protective order in the criminal case, 
EXHIBIT A, Ms. Maxwell can file an unredacted version of this motion in the 
criminal appeal only. She cannot file an unredacted version of this motion in the 
civil appeal. 
Accordingly, in the criminal appeal, Ms. Maxwell will file a sealed and 
unredacted copy of this motion along with a motion for leave to file under seal. She 
will publicly file on ECF the redacted copy of this motion. 
In the civil appeal, Ms. Maxwell will file on ECF the redacted copy of this 
motion only.

5 
arguments made by Ms. Maxwell that material should remain sealed because of the 
potential for a criminal investigation. E.g., EXHIBIT C, p 2. For example, when Ms. 
Maxwell moved to stay discovery in Farmer v. Indyke, Case No. 19-cv-10475 (LGS-
DCF) (S.D.N.Y.), due to the pending criminal investigation, Ms. Giuffre opposed 
the motion on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell could not show the existence or scope 
of any such criminal investigation, 
 
 
Maxwell has provided no information about the subject matter of the 
criminal investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the 
investigation, or even disclosed whether she herself is a target of the 
Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel asked 
Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation 
during their meet and confer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide 
any details. 
EX. C, p 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page6 of 15

, after the parties had briefed the 
motion to unseal the deposition material and after Judge Preska ordered the 
deposition material unsealed, Ms. Maxwell asked Judge Preska to briefly stay the 
unsealing process. EXHIBIT D, p 1. But because of the criminal protective order, all 
Ms. Maxwell could reveal to Judge Preska was that she was aware of critical new 
information. EX. D, p 1. She couldn’t tell Judge Preska what that information was. 
EX. D, pp 1–2. 
Judge Preska declined to stay the unsealing process but said he would 
reevaluate if Judge Nathan modified the criminal protective order and allowed Ms. 
Maxwell to share with Judge Preska, under seal, all she learned as described above. 
EXHIBIT E, pp 1–2. 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page7 of 15

 
7
 Judge Nathan has now denied that request, 
EXHIBIT F, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page8 of 15

 
8 
 
 
  
Ms. Maxwell has appealed Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition 
material, Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413 (2d Cir.), and she is now appealing 
Judge Nathan’s order denying the motion to modify the criminal protective order, 
United States v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-3061 (2d Cir.). 
 
 
 
 
 
Argument 
This Court should consolidate the appeal of Judge Preska’s order unsealing 
the deposition material with the appeal of Judge Nathan’s order denying the 
motion to modify the criminal protective order. Consolidation is necessary for a fair 
and efficient resolution of these appeals. 
First, unless this Court consolidates these appeals, it will find itself in the 
very same position as the two district courts—one panel of this Court will be privy 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page9 of 15
-

 
9
to relevant and material information (the panel hearing the criminal case) while the 
other panel will be in the dark (the panel hearing the civil case). This even though 
two panels of this Court stand on equal judicial footing. 
Second, only through consolidation can this Court resolve these issues in a 
fair and consistent fashion. This Court has supervisory jurisdiction over the 
Southern District of New York. The judges of that court, however, have reached 
inconsistent results to the prejudice of Ms. Maxwell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page10 of 15

 
10
Third, it’s essential that Ms. Maxwell be able to share with Judge Preska 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page11 of 15

 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
. The government in the criminal 
case before Judge Nathan refused to agree to a modification of the protective order 
to allow Ms. Maxwell to inform Judge Preska of the material facts. EXHIBIT G. 
According to the government, even though all Ms. Maxwell sought was permission 
to share the requested information with other judicial officers under seal, a 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page12 of 15
-

 
12
modification of the protective order would destroy the secrecy of the ongoing grand 
jury investigation. EX. G, p 3–4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 In Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d at 47–
48, this Court concluded that the right of access demanded the unsealing of the 
civil summary judgment material. A fair and consistent application of the decision 
in Brown supports Ms. Maxwell’s request to share with Judge Preska the 
information she learned from Judge Nathan. There’s no reason Judge Preska 
should be deprived access to material presumptively available to the public. 
Case 20-3061, Document 17, 09/10/2020, 2928288, Page13 of 15

 
13
Conclusion 
For these reasons, this Court should consolidate United States v. Maxwell, 
Case No. 20-3061, with Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413.

or designated as “confidential” as described below, and/or 
electronic Discovery materials designated as “confidential” by 
the Government, including such materials marked as 
“confidential” either on the documents or materials themselves,

7 
the Court for an Order de-designating such documents or 
materials.  The Government’s designation of such documents and 
materials as Confidential Information will be controlling absent 
contrary order of the Court. 
10. 
Confidential Information disclosed to the 
defendant, or Defense Counsel, respectively, during the course 
of proceedings in this action:

the presence of Defense Counsel or when provided access to 
Discovery materials in electronic format by BOP officials; 
f)

have read and signed this Order acknowledging that such 
individual(s) are bound by this Order. 
11. 
Copies of Discovery or other materials produced 
by the Government in this action bearing “highly confidential” 
stamps or otherwise specifically designated as “highly 
confidential,” and/or electronic Discovery materials designated 
as “highly confidential” by the Government, including such 
materials marked as “highly confidential” either on the 
documents or materials themselves, or designated as “highly 
confidential” in an index, folder title, or document title, are 
deemed “Highly Confidential Information.”  To the extent any 
Highly Confidential Information is physically produced to the 
Defendant and Defense Counsel, rather than being made available 
to the Defendant and Defense Counsel for on-site review, the

“highly confidential” stamps on the documents or materials 
themselves.

partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other 
depictions of individuals.

Defense Counsel may, at any time, notify the 
Government that Defense Counsel does not concur in the

Re: 
Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, Richard D. Kahn, & Ghislaine Maxwell, 
19-10475-LGS-DCF 
 
 
 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
Pursuant to Individual Rule I.D, Plaintiff Annie Farmer hereby responds to Defendant 
Ghislaine Maxwell’s request for a pre-motion conference in connection with her anticipated 
motion to stay discovery in this matter.  The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion 
conference and deny her anticipated motion in its entirety because, as explained below, each of 
Maxwell’s reasons for staying discovery is meritless and the motion is simply another attempt to 
unjustifiably delay this litigation. 
First, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of discovery.  
“[A] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been 
characterized as an extraordinary remedy.”  Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 
83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this Circuit, courts balance the 
following six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal 
proceedings: 
1) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented 
in the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have 
been indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously 
weighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private 
interests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the 
public interest. 
Id. at 99.  And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending 
a criminal investigation:  “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a 
civil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a 
stay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.”  In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig., 
133 F.R.D. 12, 13–14 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).  The Court 
should deny Maxwell’s motion for a stay without prejudice to her ability to renew her application 
if she is arrested.  Until that happens, however, there are no grounds for a stay.

Further, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject matter of the criminal 
investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed 
whether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation.  When Plaintiff’s counsel 
asked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and 
confer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details.  “A civil defendant urging such a stay 
[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.”  Rex & Roberta 
Ling Living Tr. v. B Commc’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal quotation 
marks omitted).  Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge 
her discovery obligations in this matter, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any 
details or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this 
Circuit.1   
Second, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery.  As 
this Court knows, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”).  See Tr. of Feb. 11, 2020 Conf. at 36:15–18 
(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin 
Islands, they may end up unstayed.”).  But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go 
forward tomorrow, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized 
that victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the 
program.  Tr. of Feb 11, 2020 Conf. at 6:10–18 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not 
required in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb 11, 2020 Conf. at 17:2–3 (Court 
recognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the 
program); Tr. of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at 26:10–11 (“The default in this Court is that it does not 
stay discovery.”).  Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s 
Estate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a 
stay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a 
Defendant in addition to the Estate.  Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might, 
in fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program.  Tr. of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at 
27:8– 11 (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery 
before you can figure out the right settlement for a particular case.”).   
Maxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to 
participate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was 
a child.  But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized.  Even if the program 
moves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be 
released for her torts against Plaintiff.  In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the 
program would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Attorney 
General and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating.  See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Attorney 
                                                        
1  
The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her own lawsuit 
against the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue 
in that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct.  Maxwell v. Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, et al., ST-20-CV-155 (V.I. Super. Ct.); Willie v. Amerada Hess Corp., 66 V.I. 
23, 92 (Super. Ct. 2017) (common law indemnification is only available “where an innocent party 
is held vicariously liable for the actions of the true tortfeasor” (emphases in original) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted)).

General’s Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program, Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate 
No. ST-19-PB-80 (Apr. 14, 2020, V.I. Super. Ct.); Notice of Joinder of Motion for Status 
Conference Regarding Victim Compensation Fund, Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. 
ST-19-PB-80 (Apr. 29, 2020, V.I. Super. Ct.).  The claims resolution program is therefore not a 
valid basis to stay this action without Plaintiff’s consent.2 
Third, Maxwell contends that her motion to dismiss is “strong and warrants a stay of 
discovery pending its resolution.”  Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion 
to dismiss in her response to Maxwell’s letter requesting a pre-motion conference on that motion.  
ECF No. 48.  Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that 
Maxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that 
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”:  “I’ve reviewed the letter from defendant 
Maxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the 
one previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion 
to dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield.  Tr. of Apr. 16, 2020 
Conf. at 3:22–24.  Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that 
dispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s 
individual rules.  Tr. of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at 26:10–12; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule III.C.2. 
(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case 
management deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”).  Maxwell’s anticipated 
motion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this matter, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss 
have not stayed discovery in any other matter against it in this District. 
The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her 
anticipated motion to stay discovery in this matter in its entirety.  Nor is full briefing necessary to 
address the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this 
Court’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice 
to Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss.  Maxwell has already failed to comply with 
her discovery obligations in this matter, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for 
a full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another 
incentive to continue to delay.  Fact discovery in this matter ends in less than two months, and we 
respectfully submit that her delay tactics should end now. 
Respectfully submitted,

Maxwell also argues that the fact that Plaintiff’s sister (and a few other victims) have 
voluntarily stayed their cases in light of a potential claims resolution program warrants a ruling 
that Plaintiff must stay her case as well.  This makes no sense.  Plaintiff and her sister filed separate 
actions and are separate litigants.  Plaintiff’s sister’s decisions do not bind Plaintiff, nor do any 
other victims’ decisions.

Southern District of New York

New York, NY 10007 
 
Re: August 3, 2020 Order (Doc. 1096) 
Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
Dear Judge Preska: 
I write in response to the Court’s Order of August 3, 2020 (Doc. 1069), the Order and 
Protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. 1044) (“Protocol”), and to raise with the Court 
the legal effect of new information that came to the attention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on 
Friday, August 7, 2020. 
New information:  On Friday, August 7, 2020, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of 
critical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and 
fairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing 
order of July 23, 2020. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal 
defendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  
Counsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an 
officer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because 
it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil 
proceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order 
of the Court.”  Protective Order, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) at ¶¶ 1(a), 18 (Exhibit A). As required by 
that Protective Order and Judge Nathan’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel 
initiated a conferral with the U.S. Attorney’s Office over the weekend concerning a 
modification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second 
Circuit.  Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order 
in the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with 
this Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under 
seal if necessary).

Ms. Maxwell requests a temporary stay of the unsealing process for approximately 
three weeks until the conclusion of (a) the conferral with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to a 
modification of the Protective Order in the Criminal Action and, if necessary, an application 
and ruling by Judge Nathan on the issue, to permit the use of the information in this Court and 
before the Second Circuit (under seal in both courts, if necessary), (b) an application to this 
Court containing the new information in support of a request to stay the unsealing process 
until the conclusion of the Criminal Action, and (c) a ruling by this Court on the motion for 
stay. 
Streamlining of Unsealing Process: As directed by the Court, counsel for Ms. Maxwell 
conferred with plaintiff’s counsel concerning various proposals to streamline the unsealing 
process.  Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described 
above, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we 
hope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing 
move ahead.  Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to 
notify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the 
unsealing before deciding how to proceed with future redactions.  Although this will give the 
Court and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are 
limitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process.  As counsel has made clear in 
the past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the 
excerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see 
his or her own information (but not that of other Non-Parties).  After receiving a request from 
a Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to 
send to them for review.  But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of 
participating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed 
to Plaintiff’s suggestion on that front.  The parties can submit a proposed modification of the 
Protocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement. 
We also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the 
Original Parties to object and to respond from 14 to 7 days.  This would impact paragraphs 
2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol.  The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the 
Protocol to the Court.  The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at 14 
days given some practical considerations applicable to them. 
Although the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of 
Plaintiff’s proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements. 
First, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of 
briefing to ten pages per side.  Id. Our initial Objection (DE 1057) was 14 pages long; 
Plaintiff’s Response was 19 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many 
respects, not specific enough.  We would ask leave to at least have 15 pages to object to the 
five motions proposed below, with any response limited to the same.  We will endeavor to 
keep it shorter than that, but also allow for more space to provide specifics to the Court. 
Second, we have obtained new contact information for Doe 1 from a separate civil 
suit.  We believe that Doe 1 retains a right to notification and participation.  We suggest 
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP   Document 1100   Filed 08/10/20   Page 2 of 3
Case 20-3061, Document 21, 09/10/2020, 2928292, Page3 of 4

Honorable Loretta A. Preska 
August 10, 2020 
Page 3 
 
providing the Notice to Doe 1 at the new address for any future pleadings that implicate his or 
her deposition, which is currently subject to the Second Circuit’s stay. 
Third, to prevent against some of the errors that occurred during the last round of 
unsealings, we request that the Protocol be amended to require the Responding Original Party 
who proposes unsealing to supply with their Response a proposed unredacted set of the 
pleadings at issue, for the Court’s consideration and for the Objecting Original Party or Non-
Party to have the right of reply.  Preparing those redactions after the fact allows much 
ambiguity into the Court’s ruling and we believe the Court’s ruling should specify which 
redactions it is accepting or rejecting at the time of ruling. 
Finally, we request that the Court allow for the any objecting Non-Party or Original 
Party be given 7 days following any unseal order to apply for relief in the Second Circuit from 
the order prior to the documents being released.   
Proposed Next Set of Docket Entries for Review:   
Given the Second Circuit’s stay concerning Ms. Maxwell and Doe 1’s deposition 
transcripts and materials that quote from them, we propose that the Court deviate from the 
Doe 1 and 2 chronology (given that Doe 1’s deposition is sprinkled throughout those motions) 
and instead take the following five decided motions and their related pleadings. This list 
represents the first five chronological decided motions that (a) have sealed or redacted 
materials and (b) do not have attached or quote from documents subject to the stay.  They are: 
• 75 – Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Defendant’s First Set of 
Discovery Responses to Plaintiff 
• 139 – Plaintiff’s Brief in Support of the Privilege Claimed for In Camera 
Submission 
• 155 – Defendant’s Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents 
• 215 – Sharon Churcher Motion to Quash Subpoena 
• 231 – Defendant’s Motion to Reopen Deposition of Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell is available for a telephone conference to discuss any of the 
foregoing, should the Court desire. 
Respectfully submitted,

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,  
Plaintiff, 
-against- 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,  
Defendant. 
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
ORDER 
 
 
LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge:  
 
The Court has reviewed the parties’ letters dated August 10 
and August 11, 2020.  (See dkt. nos. 1099-1101.) The Court writes 
specifically to address Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s request for 
a three-week stay of the unsealing process due to the availability 
of “critical new information” related both to this action and to 
the pending criminal case against her, U.S. v. Maxwell, No. 20 Cr. 
330 (AJN).  (See dkt. no. 1100 at 1-2.)1    
 
Ms. Maxwell’s request is denied.  Given that Ms. Maxwell is 
not at liberty to disclose this new information because it is 
subject to the protective order in the criminal action, (id. at 
1), the Court has no reasonable basis to impose a stay.  And, as 
Ms. Maxwell knows, her ipse dixit does not provide compelling 
 
1 Pursuant to the Court’s Order dated August 3, 2020 [dkt. no. 
1094], the parties have also submitted to the Court for resolution 
various disputes related to (1) methods for streamlining the 
unsealing process, and (2) the next set of docket entries to be 
reviewed for potential unsealing.  The Court will address those 
disputes at a later date.

grounds for relief.  Should the protective order in the criminal 
action be modified to permit disclosure of the relevant information 
to the Court, Ms. Maxwell may renew her request for a stay of the 
unsealing process.

MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
 
 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
 
On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed letter motion seeking 
an Order modifying the protective order in this case.1  Specifically, she sought a Court order 
allowing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that 
she received in discovery from the Government in this case.  She also sought permission to 
 
1 This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.  
The Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion that the Government proposed on 
August 21, 2020, and it will enter that version into the public docket.  The Court’s decision to adopt the 
Government’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the 
documents in question are “judicial documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to 
the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access.  Id. at 119-20.  “Such 
countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’ 
and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 
1048 (2d Cir.1995) (“Amodeo II”)).  The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test.  First, the Court finds 
that the defendant’s letter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test.  United 
States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).  Second, the Court assumes that the common law 
presumption of access attaches, thereby satisfying the second element.  But in balancing competing considerations 
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including, 
most notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury 
investigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrowly tailored redactions.   
 
In light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to 
the Defendant’s reply letter, dated August 24, 2020 and the Defendant’s August 24, 2020 letter addressing her 
proposed redactions to the Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion.  The parties are further ORDERED to submit 
their proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions, 
they shall submit a joint letter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.

reference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.  For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.   
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), a Court may enter a protective order 
only after it finds that good cause exists.  Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing 
protective order is warranted.2  To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant 
factors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has 
sufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant matter.   
On July 30, 2020, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined 
that good cause existed.  Dkt. No. 36.  The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.  
See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating 
to the proposed protective order.”).  The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a 
provision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and 
not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.”  Dkt. No. 29, 
Ex. A ¶ 1(a).  That language was included in the Court’s July 30, 2020 protective order.  See Dkt. 
No. 36 ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a).  Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery. 
Upon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which 
seeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal 
 
2 In the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.”  In re Teligent, 
Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for 
modification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context.  See, e.g., United States v. Calderon, 
No. 3:15-CR-25 (JCH), 2017 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017) (applying the civil standard for the 
modification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. 07-CR-1027 (LAP), 2014 WL 
12710346 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (same).  See also United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (applying the standard for “good cause” in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective 
order entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 2007) (same).

case in other civil proceedings.  She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the 
Documents to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of issues being litigated in those civil matters.  But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated 
rhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to 
why that is the case.  She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to 
make before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in 
this criminal matter under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.  And she 
furnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be 
made in those matters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order 
to allow such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those matters.  In sum, the 
arguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause.  The 
Defendant’s request is DENIED on this basis. 
Indeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further 
lacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the 
judicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the 
Government’s docketed letter on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  In the opening paragraph of her 
reply letter dated August 24, 2020, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose 
under seal to certain judicial officers the following factual information:  
1.  Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government 
opened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-
conspirators;  
2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand 
jury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;

3. In February 2019, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of 
those civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury 
subpoenas;  
4. In April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) permitted the modification and, subsequently, 
another court (“Court-2”) did not;  
5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-1, the 
Recipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by 
the protective order; and  
6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of 
Rule 16 discovery in this criminal matter.   
With the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil 
matters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the letter 
filed on the public docket by the Government on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  Although this 
Court remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that 
those courts can make their own determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by 
the protective order in this matter, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the 
relevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the 
relevant judicial decision makers and civil matters. 
In addition, the Government has indicated that “there is no impediment to counsel 
making sealed applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant 
materials.”  Dkt. No. 46 at 3 n.5.  In her reply, the Defendant asserts that she is amenable to such 
a solution if the Court agrees with the Government that doing so would not contravene the 
protective order in this case.  To the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by the protective

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s letter of 
August 17, 2020 (the “Defense Letter”), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the 
defendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced 
by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other 
discovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases.  Those applications should 
be denied.1 
As an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce, 
substantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations.  Those include 
materials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative 
methods available only to the Government.  Indeed, the Government has already produced more 
than 165,000 pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense 
Letter.  Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated 
civil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated 
“Confidential” thereunder.  As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely 
appropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by 
the issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.  
                                                 
1 The Government has drafted this letter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed 
materials and grand jury information.  Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to 
seal or redact this submission.  Because the Defense Letter repeatedly references, and attaches as 
exhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if 
filed publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate letter, under seal, proposing redactions 
to the Defense Letter and requesting that the attachments to the Defense Letter be filed under seal.

In particular, the Defense Letter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating 
to applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other 
judicial proceedings.  By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit 
compliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”).  Those Subpoenas were issued 
to a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into 
Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators.  For obvious reasons and in keeping with its 
standard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued 
the Subpoenas.  In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government 
that it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance.  Accordingly, in 
or about February 2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to 
request modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.  
In or about April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) granted the Government’s application, and permitted 
that the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further 
dissemination—to the Recipient. 2   Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the 
Government’s application.  Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both 
Court-1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal, 
except that both have expressly permitted the Government to produce those filings to the defendant 
as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case.  The Defense Letter now seeks to use 
those discovery materials in the Civil Cases. 
At base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process 
of criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the 
criminal discovery process and civil litigation.  To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is 
to enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of 
materials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery.  Her motion is nothing more than an 
effort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago.  It 
should be denied for multiple reasons. 
First, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides 
that any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of 
designation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the 
defense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the 
defense of this action.”  Protective Order ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36).  Indeed, 
the defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her own proposed protective order. 
This was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed.  See 
Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order ¶ 1(a) (Dkt. 29-1).  Yet less than a month later, the 
defendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the 
                                                 
2 In the Defense Letter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the 
sealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the 
Government’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties.  The defendant’s 
suggestion is patently incorrect.  The relevant order was signed in April 2019 and was issued for 
the purpose of being provided to the Recipient.  Indeed the order contained an explicit provision 
that it could be transmitted to the Recipient.  Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient 
well over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.

Government in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably 
applies, to litigate her Civil Cases.  There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here. 
Second, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective 
order that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal 
discovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party.  To allow the 
defendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those 
that are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third 
parties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations.  Here, the Government was particularly 
concerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her 
counsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases.  It would be grossly 
inappropriate for defense counsel to be permitted to sift through the criminal case discovery and 
cherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend 
against accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-
sealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.  
And yet that is what the defendant proposes. 
Third, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an 
ongoing grand jury investigation.  Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain 
under seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those 
matters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Letter, remain sealed.3  As 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the 
investigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of 
Jeffrey Epstein remains active.  The full scope and details of that investigation, however, have not 
been made public.4  Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were 
produced under a “Confidential” designation.  Any argument that such materials are not 
“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also 
misapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.5  See, 
                                                 
3 The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (1) as noted above, the permission from Court-1 
to provide the April 2019 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions 
the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the 
record relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case.  The 
defendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without 
any application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect. 
4 To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the 
nature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental 
letter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an 
explanation. 
5 Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are 
improperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-1 and 
Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.  Presumably they have not done so because

e.g., United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“As a general proposition, 
courts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are 
presumptively accessible, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might ‘adversely affect 
law enforcement interests.’”) (citing United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050)); see also 
United States v. Park, 619 F. Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that the need to “maintain 
the secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain 
sentencing documents).   
Fourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal 
defendant should be permitted to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases.  Nor is the 
Government aware of any.  Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—
perhaps because few defendants attempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, 15 Cr. 
025, 2017 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017) (discussing the relative lack of specific 
guidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also 
United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 721 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[m]otions to modify protective 
orders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of 
blurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant attempts here.  See 
Calderon, 2017 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a 
criminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOIA suit); United States 
v. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2020 WL 1495880, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2020) (denying 
a defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of 
pursuing claims in a civil action, even following the completion of trial). 
Absent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion, 
makes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome.  In 
particular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the 
Government secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling 
the defendant.  That is how grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work.  Defense 
counsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the 
Government obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about 
the manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.   
Certainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has 
engaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to 
suggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to 
circumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.  
In any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access 
to is the lone April 2019 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil 
Cases at this stage is significantly overstated.  And to the extent the defendant may seek to make 
similar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government 
obtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently 
                                                 
they recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury 
investigation.

requested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously 
oppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.  
Finally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehow necessary 
to her ability to bring issues to the attention of other courts, the Defense Letter completely fails to 
explain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery 
materials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil 
Cases.  The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization 
for compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the 
Civil Cases.  To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that 
courts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the 
defendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in 
those cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of 
malfeasance.6 
In sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the 
relevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court 
to permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate 
a civil case.  Accordingly, the application in the Defense Letter should be denied.

materials to attack the Government in the Civil Cases, attacks of no discernable relevance in those 
cases and made in a forum in which the Government is not a party and would have no opportunity

COUNTY OF NEW YORK 
 
 
:  ss.: 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ) 
 
MAURENE COMEY, pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, 
Section 1746, hereby affirms under penalty of perjury:  
1. 
I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of 
Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York, and I am one of the Assistant United States Attorneys representing the 
Government on this appeal.  Defendant-appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from 
a September 2, 2020 order of the District Court denying Maxwell’s motion to 
modify the protective order regulating criminal discovery in United States v. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Order”).  I respectfully submit this 
affirmation in support of the Government’s motion to dismiss Maxwell’s 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page2 of 24

2 
 
interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the Order is neither a final 
judgment nor an appealable collateral order, and in opposition to Maxwell’s 
motion to consolidate this appeal with the appeal pending in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
No. 20-2413. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
2. 
On June 29, 2020, Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) was filed under 
seal in the Southern District of New York, charging Maxwell in six counts.  (Dist. 
Ct. Docket Entry 1).1  On July 2, 2020, Maxwell was arrested and the original 
indictment was unsealed.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 2).  On July 8, 2020, 
Superseding Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Indictment”) was filed in the 
Southern District of New York.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 17).  Count One of the 
Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage 
in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Two charges Maxwell 
with enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 2422 and 2.  Count Three charges Maxwell with conspiracy to transport 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count 
Four charges Maxwell with transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2.  Counts Five and Six charge Maxwell with 
                                                 
1 “Dist. Ct. Docket Entry” refers to the corresponding numbered entry in the 
District Court’s docket for this case; “Mot.” refers to Maxwell’s motion to 
consolidate; and “Ex.” refers to an exhibit to Maxwell’s motion to consolidate.

perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.  The matter remains pending in the 
pretrial phase before the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge.  
Maxwell’s pretrial motions are due on December 21, 2020, and trial has been 
scheduled to commence on July 12, 2021. 
3. 
On July 30, 2020, upon the Government’s application, Judge 
Nathan entered a protective order governing the parties’ disclosure of information 
produced in discovery in the criminal case (the “Protective Order”).  (Ex. A).  The 
Protective Order expressly provides that any and all discovery material produced to 
Maxwell by the Government, regardless of designation, “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this 
criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the 
defense of this action.”  (Protective Order ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a)).  The Protective 
Order further provides that any discovery material produced to Maxwell by the 
Government that is marked “confidential” may not be filed publicly or excerpted 
within any public filing.  (Id. ¶ 15).  Maxwell’s criminal defense counsel consented 
to the foregoing provisions of the Protective Order.  (See Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 
29). 
4. 
On August 17, 2020, Maxwell filed a motion before Judge 
Nathan seeking an order modifying the Protective Order to allow Maxwell to use 
confidential criminal discovery materials, which were produced to Maxwell by the 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page4 of 24

4 
 
Government, in filings Maxwell intended to submit in separate civil litigation.  
(District Court Docket Entry 52).  In particular, Maxwell’s motion sought 
authorization to use materials relating to applications the Government previously 
made in 2019 seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other judicial 
proceedings. 
5. 
On August 21, 2020, the Government filed an opposition to 
Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 46).  In 
its opposition, the Government explained the factual background regarding the 
confidential criminal discovery materials at issue.  In particular, the Government 
explained that those discovery materials related to the Government’s requests to 
modify certain protective orders in civil cases to permit compliance with grand 
jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”).  Those Subpoenas were issued to a certain 
recipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a grand jury investigation into 
Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators.  In order to maintain the integrity 
of the grand jury investigation and in accordance with both Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not notify 
Maxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas.  In response to receiving the Subpoenas, 
the Recipient advised the Government that it believed that certain existing 
protective orders precluded full compliance.  Accordingly, in or about February 
2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page5 of 24

5 
 
request modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with 
the Subpoenas.  In or about April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) granted the 
Government’s application, and permitted the Government to share Court-1’s 
order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further dissemination—to the 
Recipient.  Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Government’s 
application.  Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both 
Court-1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain 
under seal, except that both have expressly permitted the Government to produce 
those filings to Maxwell as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. 
6. 
After providing that factual background, the Government 
argued that Maxwell’s motion should be denied for failing to show good cause to 
modify the Protective Order for several reasons.  First, Maxwell had consented to 
the portions of the Protective Order that prohibit use of criminal discovery 
materials produced by the Government in any civil litigation.  Second, Maxwell 
had cited no authority to support the argument that a criminal defendant should be 
permitted to use criminal discovery in civil cases.  Third, Maxwell utterly failed to 
explain how the criminal discovery materials at issue supported any legal argument 
she wished to make in civil litigation.  The Government also noted that to the 
extent Maxwell sought to challenge the process by which the Government sought 
compliance with the Subpoenas and obtained certain materials that it intended to 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page6 of 24

6 
 
use in prosecuting its criminal case, she would have a full opportunity to do so in 
her pretrial motions in the criminal case before Judge Nathan.  
7. 
On August 24, 2020, Maxwell filed a reply in further support of 
her motion.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 54). 
8. 
On September 2, 2020, Judge Nathan issued the Order denying 
Maxwell’s motion.  (Ex. F).  In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite 
“fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had offered “no more 
than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions” regarding why the criminal 
discovery materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases.  (Id. at 
3).  Judge Nathan concluded that absent any “coherent explanation” of how the 
criminal discovery materials related to any argument Maxwell intended to make in 
civil litigation, Maxwell had “plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the 
Protective Order.  (Id.).  Further, Judge Nathan noted that the basic facts Maxwell 
sought to introduce in civil litigation were already made public through the 
Government’s letter in opposition to her motion.  (Id. at 3-4).  Accordingly, even 
though Judge Nathan “remain[ed] in the dark as to why this information will be 
relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, Judge Nathan expressly 
permitted Maxwell to inform the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of 
the basic series of events set forth in paragraph 5, supra.  (Id. at 4).

the Order.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 55).  On September 10, 2020, Maxwell filed the 
instant motion to consolidate this appeal with the appeal currently pending in 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413.  The Government is not a party to the appeal in 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, which concerns an order issued in a civil case unsealing 
materials that were previously filed under seal. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
THE APPEAL SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF 
JURISDICTION 
 
 
A. 
Applicable Law     
 
 
1. 
The Collateral Order Doctrine 
10. 
Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291 expressly limits the 
jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals to “final decisions of the district courts.”  28 
U.S.C. § 1291.  “This final judgment rule requires that a party must ordinarily raise 
all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits.  In a 
criminal case[,] the rule prohibits appellate review until conviction and imposition 
of sentence.”  Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984) (internal 
citations and quotation marks omitted); accord United States v. Aliotta, 199 F.3d 
78, 81 (2d Cir. 1999).  As the Supreme Court has “long held,” the “policy of 
Congress embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial 
court decisions which do not terminate the litigation, and . . . this policy is at its 
strongest in the field of criminal law.”  United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page8 of 24

8 
 
458 U.S. 263, 265 (1982) (per curiam); see also Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 270 (noting 
“overriding policies against interlocutory review in criminal cases” and that 
“exceptions to the final judgment rule in criminal cases are rare”); United States v. 
Culbertson, 598 F.3d 40, 46 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that “‘undue litigiousness 
and leaden-footed administration of justice,’ the common consequences of 
piecemeal appellate review, are ‘particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal 
cases’” (quoting Di Bella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 124 (1962))). 
11. 
There is a limited exception to this rule that permits immediate 
appeal from certain collateral orders.  See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 
463, 468 (1978) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 
(1949)).  To fall within the “small class” of decisions that constitute immediately 
appealable collateral orders, the decision must “(1) conclusively determine the 
disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the 
merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final 
judgment.”  Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 522 (1988) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). 
12. 
The Supreme Court has made clear that the collateral order 
exception should be “interpreted . . . with the utmost strictness in criminal cases.”  
Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265); accord United 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page9 of 24

9 
 
States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 487, 490 (2d Cir. 2007).  In over 70 years since 
Cohen was decided, despite “numerous opportunities” to expand the doctrine, 
Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799, the Supreme Court has identified only four 
types of pretrial orders in criminal cases as satisfying the collateral-order doctrine: 
an order denying a bond, Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); an order denying a 
motion to dismiss on Double Jeopardy grounds, Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 
651 (1977); an order denying a motion to dismiss under the Speech or Debate 
Clause, Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S. 500 (1979); and an order permitting the 
forced administration of antipsychotic drugs to render a defendant competent for 
trial, Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003).  In contrast, the circumstances in 
which the Supreme Court has “refused to permit interlocutory appeals” in criminal 
cases have been “far more numerous.”  Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799. 
13. 
As to the third Van Cauwenberghe criterion, “[a]n order is 
‘effectively unreviewable’ where ‘the order at issue involves an asserted right the 
legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated 
before trial.’”  United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d 1, 5 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Lauro 
Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 498-99 (1989)).  “The justification for 
immediate appeal must . . . be sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of 
deferring appeal until litigation concludes.”  Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 
U.S. 100, 107 (2009).  A ruling that is burdensome to a party “in ways that are only 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page10 of 24

10 
 
imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final district court judgment is not 
sufficient.”  Punn, 737 F.3d at 5 (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting 
Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 107).  “Instead, the decisive consideration is whether 
delaying review until the entry of final judgment ‘would imperil a substantial 
public interest’ or ‘some particular value of a high order.’”  Mohawk Indus., 558 
U.S. at 107 (quoting Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 352-53 (2006)); see also 
Kensington Int’l Ltd. v. Republic of Congo, 461 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir. 2006).  In a 
criminal case, the availability of post-judgment relief through reversal or vacatur of 
conviction, if warranted, will generally be sufficient to protect whatever right a 
defendant claims was abridged by the district court’s pretrial decision.  See, e.g., 
Punn, 737 F.3d at 14 (“Punn’s claim can be adequately vindicated upon appeal 
from a final judgment. . . . [I]f Punn’s arguments continue to fail before the district 
court, purportedly ill-gotten evidence or its fruits are admitted at his trial, and 
conviction results, appellate review will be available at that point[,] . . . [and the 
Court] may order a new trial without the use of the ill-gotten evidence, or whatever 
additional remedies are necessary to ensure that Punn’s legitimate interests are 
fully preserved.”); United States v. Hitchcock, 992 F.2d 236, 239 (9th Cir. 1993) 
(district court’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because 
“[r]eversal after trial, if it is warranted, will adequately protect . . . interest[s]” 
asserted by defendants).   
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page11 of 24

11 
 
14. 
When applying the collateral-order doctrine, the Supreme Court 
has “generally denied review of pretrial discovery orders.”  Firestone Tire & 
Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (1981).  This Court likewise has 
consistently ruled that protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged 
by the parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.  See, 
e.g., United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. 1986) (“We hold that this 
collateral protective order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 . . . .”); United 
States v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d Cir. 1996) (“To the extent that the 
[protective] order imposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materials 
exchanged in the course of pending litigation, it is not subject to appeal.”); see also 
H.L. Hayden Co. of N.Y. v. Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 90 (2d Cir. 
1986) (“The district court’s denial of modification [of a protective order] does not 
fall within the ‘collateral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”).  Because “a litigant does not 
have ‘an unrestrained right to disseminate information that has been obtained 
through pretrial discovery,’” such protective orders do not amount to an 
impermissible prior restraint under the First Amendment.  Caparros, 800 F.2d at 
25 (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 31 (1984)).  Even where a 
litigant raises a colorable argument that a protective order violates a litigant’s right 
to release documents outside of criminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right 
can await final judgment on the underlying charges” because the “purported right 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page12 of 24

12 
 
at issue is not related to any right not to stand trial.”  Id. at 26. 
 
 
2. 
Appeals Involving Injunctions 
15. 
Title 28, United States Code, Section 1292(a)(1) provides that 
Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory orders of the district 
courts of the United States . . . or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, 
modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify 
injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.”  
Orders regulating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched “using words of 
restraint,” are not injunctions and are therefore not appealable under § 1292(a)(1).  
See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (“Protective orders that only regulate materials 
exchanged between the parties incident to litigation, like most discovery orders, are 
neither final orders, appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, nor injunctions, appealable 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).” (internal citations omitted)); Caparros, 800 F.2d at 
26.   
B. 
Discussion 
16. 
There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and 
thus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that 
constitute immediately appealable collateral orders.  Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. 
at 522.  Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrow category of 
collateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page13 of 24

13 
 
rule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be 
dismissed.  Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).  
Among other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for 
identifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order 
being appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final 
judgment.”  Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omitted) 
(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468).  Accordingly, this Court does not 
have jurisdiction to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed. 
17. 
As an initial matter, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this 
Court cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts 
of this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim 
belongs.”  Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 
Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, 
Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 868 (1994)).  Here, like any other order regulating the use of 
discovery materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s 
Order declining to modify the Protective Order in this criminal case is not subject 
to interlocutory appeal.  See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 800 F.2d at 24-26.   
18. 
There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within 
the four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable 
prejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy, 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page14 of 24

14 
 
the Speech or Debate Clause, or the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs.  
See Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799; Sell, 539 U.S. at 176-77.  The rights 
implicated here do not meet the high threshold of expanding the collateral order 
exception in criminal cases beyond those limited categories.  Rather, this Order 
falls within the category of rulings addressing pretrial discovery, which are 
generally unreviewable on interlocutory appeal.  See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; 
Caparros, 800 F.2d at 24-26.  Maxwell has identified no public interest or value 
that is “sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until 
litigation concludes.”  Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 107. 
19. 
Maxwell seems to claim that reversal of Judge Nathan’s Order 
is necessary in order to prevent documents in a civil case from being unsealed.  
Even assuming a presentation of criminal discovery materials would affect an 
unsealing decision in a civil case — an argument that Judge Nathan found 
speculative at best (Ex. F at 3) — a risk of unsealing is not significant enough to 
merit interlocutory appeal.  See United States v. Martoma, No. 13-4807, 2014 WL 
68119, at *1 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2014) (concluding that even though the defendant’s 
“personal interest in the privacy of embarrassing information is an interest that, as 
a practical matter, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that interest is 
insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal); United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d 
990, 998 (9th Cir. 2012) (finding no jurisdiction over defendant’s interlocutory 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page15 of 24

15 
 
appeal from unsealing of competency evaluation because “any alleged incursions 
on criminal defendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not render the unsealing 
order effectively unreviewable on appeal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district 
court’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because “[r]eversal 
after trial, if it is warranted, will adequately protect . . . interest[s]” asserted by 
defendant); cf. Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 109 (holding that orders to disclose 
privileged information are not immediately appealable even though they “intrude[] 
on the confidentiality of attorney-client communications”). 
20. 
To the extent Maxwell complains that unsealing filings in a 
civil case may result in unfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, such a concern 
is not an issue that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.  
Indeed, that very issue has been reviewed by this Court in multiple cases on post-
judgment appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d 
Cir. 2010) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased the 
venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 515 F.3d 100, 128-31 (2d Cir. 2008) (evaluating 
on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial jurors).  Should the Court 
determine that the jury at Maxwell’s trial was biased based on disclosure of 
material in a civil case, and that such material would not have been unsealed had 
Judge Nathan permitted modification of the Protective Order, then vacatur of the 
defendant’s conviction – if warranted – will adequately vindicate the defendant’s 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page16 of 24

16 
 
right to an impartial jury.  See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d 164, 201-04, 
213 (2d Cir. 2002) (vacating conviction where district court improperly refused to 
excuse potential juror who admitted bias based upon knowledge of defendant’s 
previous acquittal).  Thus, the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury would 
not “be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. 
at 799 (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435 
U.S. 850, 860 (1978)), and, as such, the Order does not meet the third criterion for 
appealability of a collateral order. See Punn, 737 F.3d at 14 (defendant’s interests 
“can be adequately vindicated upon appeal from a final judgment” through “a new 
trial . . . or whatever additional remedies are necessary”). 
21. 
Simply put, the Order denying Maxwell’s motion to amend the 
Protective Order is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal.  Maxwell complains 
that if she cannot use criminal discovery materials in civil litigation then there is a 
risk that certain filings in the civil cases may be unsealed that otherwise would 
have remained sealed.  Maxwell apparently believes such a result would risk 
prejudicing her trial rights in the criminal case.  If such materials are unsealed in 
the civil case, and if Maxwell believes that unsealing causes her prejudice at her 
criminal trial, Maxwell will have a full opportunity to raise that issue in the 
criminal case.  To the extent Maxwell is concerned that unsealing in the civil case 
might permit the Government to oppose any motion challenging the unsealing 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page17 of 24

17 
 
order it obtained during its criminal investigation on the grounds of inevitable 
discovery, she will have the opportunity to assert such a claim before Judge 
Nathan.  If she is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s decision on that score, she can 
raise the issue on appeal after the entry of final judgment. 
22. 
Further, given the substance of Maxwell’s motion to 
consolidate, it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in 
this appeal have been finally resolved.  Maxwell’s motion to consolidate this 
matter with the Giuffre v. Maxwell appeal appears primarily focused on attacking 
the legitimacy of the Government’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends 
to use to prosecute the criminal case through the Subpoenas to the Recipient.  (See 
Mot. at 10-12).  It thus seems readily apparent that Maxwell intends to file a 
motion to preclude the use of such evidence at her criminal trial.  Yet she seeks to 
have this Court reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the 
civil appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by 
the District Court in the criminal case.  As Judge Nathan has not yet addressed (or 
even had the opportunity to address) that issue in the criminal case, the issues 
Maxwell raises on this appeal do not appear to be final.  Any such arguments are 
properly heard in the criminal case in the first instance by the district judge, “who 
play[s] a ‘special role’ in managing ongoing litigation,” and who “can better 
exercise [his or her] responsibility [to police the prejudment tactics of litigants] if 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page18 of 24

18 
 
the appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment 
rulings.”   Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 106 (alterations in original) (internal quotation 
mark omitted) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 
472 U.S. 424, 436 (1985)). 
23. 
The cases cited in Maxwell’s notice of appeal do not alter this 
analysis.  All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors — 
not parties — seeking to modify protective orders in civil cases.  See Pichler v. 
UNITE, 585 F.3d 741, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2009) (third party intervernor foundation 
appealing order denying motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to 
allow third party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity 
Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 741 (2d Cir. 1987) (Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (“CFTC”) acting as third party intervenor appealing order denying 
motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to allow CFTC to obtain 
discovery exchanged by parties to civil case permissible because “[t]he entire 
controversy between the CFTC and the defendants in this case was disposed of by 
the district court’s denial of the government’s motion to modify the protective 
order”); Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 46 (2d Cir. 2019) (third party intervenors, 
including members of the press, appealing order denying motion to modify 
protective order in civil litigation to allow third parties access to sealed filings, 
after parties to the litigation settled).  Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those cases 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page19 of 24

19 
 
was founded on the principle that when intervenors seek access to sealed records, 
“orders denying access are final as to the intervenors.”  Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of 
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasis added).  By contrast, 
rulings governing the parties’ use of discovery materials — such as Judge Nathan’s 
Order here — are not appealable in the context of a criminal prosecution until after 
judgment is entered.  See Caparros, 800 F.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. 
24. 
Judge Nathan’s Order does not fall into one of the narrow 
categories of decisions in a criminal case reviewable on interlocutory appeal.  
Accordingly, Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed. 
II. 
THE MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE SHOULD BE DENIED 
25. 
Even if Maxwell’s appeal is not dismissed — which it should 
be — her motion to consolidate the appeal in this criminal case with the appeal in 
the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case should be denied. 
26. 
Despite Maxwell’s efforts to characterize this criminal case as 
somehow intertwined with the Giuffre civil case, the issues on appeal are factually 
and legally distinct.  The civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s order unsealing civil 
litigation materials. The Government is not a party to the civil suit, the 
Government has never intervened or appeared in the civil suit, the Government has 
had no role in the litigation that resulted in Judge Preska’s order, and the 
Government has no legal interest in the relief Maxwell seeks in the civil case.  For 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page20 of 24

20 
 
these reasons alone, the Court should deny Maxwell’s motion to consolidate these 
appeals.  
27. 
Maxwell has filed two separate appeals challenging two 
different orders by two different district judges.  But Maxwell’s consolidation 
motion makes plain that her goal — in both appeals — is to ask this Court to rule 
on an entirely different question: the lawfulness of the Government’s applications 
to modify certain protective orders in other judicial proceedings.  Maxwell’s 
strategy is procedurally improper, for at least two reasons.  First, none of the 
applications or orders with which Maxwell takes issue are before this Court for 
review — the civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s unsealing order, and this 
criminal appeal concerns Judge Nathan’s Order denying Maxwell’s request to 
modify the Protective Order.  Maxwell’s motion to consolidate offers no coherent 
explanation of the connection between the legality of the Government’s prior 
applications and those two appeals.  Indeed, as Judge Nathan found, Maxwell has 
failed to explain, despite a high volume of “heated rhetoric,” how those 
applications could have any possible impact on Judge Preska’s decision to unseal 
filings in the civil litigation.   (Ex. F at 3).  Second, if Maxwell seeks to challenge 
the manner in which the Government gathered evidence in a criminal investigation, 
neither the civil appeal nor this interlocutory criminal appeal is the appropriate 
forum for her arguments on that score.  Maxwell will have the opportunity to raise 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page21 of 24

21 
 
any legal objections to the Government’s evidence before Judge Nathan, who is 
presiding over the criminal case.  If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s 
rulings on those matters, she will have a full opportunity to appeal those rulings 
after entry of final judgment in her criminal case.  The Court should not permit 
Maxwell to raise these issues at this juncture, before they have been fully litigated 
before and adjudicated by the presiding district judge. 
28. 
Moreover, Maxwell’s motion to consolidate is a transparent 
attempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this 
appeal.  That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits 
Maxwell from using certain criminal discovery materials in civil litigation.  If this 
Court were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in 
both cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in 
the manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge 
Nathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without 
requiring Maxwell to show that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by 
denying Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.2  Indeed, Maxwell’s 
motion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left 
                                                 
2 Moreover, if the appeals were consolidated, the sealed filings in this criminal 
appeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal.  The Government is 
concerned that consolidating these matters would entail disseminating sensitive, 
sealed documents in a criminal case to civil litigants. 
Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page22 of 24

22 
 
for this Court to adjudicate regarding Judge Nathan’s Order — the lone Order on 
appeal in this matter — if the Court were to grant Maxwell’s request to consolidate 
these appeals.  Accordingly, the motion to consolidate should be denied.  
CONCLUSION 
29. 
For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s appeal should be 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  If the appeal is not dismissed, the Government 
respectfully requests that the Court deny Maxwell’s motion for consolidation.

MAURENE COMEY, pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, 
Section 1746, hereby affirms under penalty of perjury:  
1. 
I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of 
Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York, and I am one of the Assistant United States Attorneys representing the 
Government on this appeal.  Defendant-appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from 
a September 2, 2020 order of the District Court denying Maxwell’s motion to 
modify the protective order regulating criminal discovery in United States v. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Order”).  I respectfully submit this 
affirmation in support of the Government’s motion to dismiss Maxwell’s 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page1 of 23

2 
 
interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the Order is neither a final 
judgment nor an appealable collateral order, and in opposition to Maxwell’s 
motion to consolidate this appeal with the appeal pending in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
No. 20-2413. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
2. 
On June 29, 2020, Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) was filed under 
seal in the Southern District of New York, charging Maxwell in six counts.  (Dist. 
Ct. Docket Entry 1).1  On July 2, 2020, Maxwell was arrested and the original 
indictment was unsealed.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 2).  On July 8, 2020, 
Superseding Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Indictment”) was filed in the 
Southern District of New York.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 17).  Count One of the 
Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage 
in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Two charges Maxwell 
with enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 2422 and 2.  Count Three charges Maxwell with conspiracy to transport 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count 
Four charges Maxwell with transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2.  Counts Five and Six charge Maxwell with 
                                                 
1 “Dist. Ct. Docket Entry” refers to the corresponding numbered entry in the 
District Court’s docket for this case; “Mot.” refers to Maxwell’s motion to 
consolidate; and “Ex.” refers to an exhibit to Maxwell’s motion to consolidate.

perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.  The matter remains pending in the 
pretrial phase before the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge.  
Maxwell’s pretrial motions are due on December 21, 2020, and trial has been 
scheduled to commence on July 12, 2021. 
3. 
On July 30, 2020, upon the Government’s application, Judge 
Nathan entered a protective order governing the parties’ disclosure of information 
produced in discovery in the criminal case (the “Protective Order”).  (Ex. A).  The 
Protective Order expressly provides that any and all discovery material produced to 
Maxwell by the Government, regardless of designation, “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this 
criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the 
defense of this action.”  (Protective Order ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a)).  The Protective 
Order further provides that any discovery material produced to Maxwell by the 
Government that is marked “confidential” may not be filed publicly or excerpted 
within any public filing.  (Id. ¶ 15).  Maxwell’s criminal defense counsel consented 
to the foregoing provisions of the Protective Order.  (See Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 
29). 
4. 
On August 17, 2020, Maxwell filed a motion before Judge 
Nathan seeking an order modifying the Protective Order to allow Maxwell to use 
confidential criminal discovery materials, which were produced to Maxwell by the 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page3 of 23

4 
 
Government, in filings Maxwell intended to submit in separate civil litigation.  
(District Court Docket Entry 52).  In particular, Maxwell’s motion sought 
authorization to use materials relating to applications the Government previously 
made in 2019 seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other judicial 
proceedings. 
5. 
On August 21, 2020, the Government filed an opposition to 
Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 46).  In 
its opposition, the Government explained the factual background regarding the 
confidential criminal discovery materials at issue.  In particular, the Government 
explained that those discovery materials related to the Government’s requests to 
modify certain protective orders in civil cases to permit compliance with grand 
jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”).  Those Subpoenas were issued to a certain 
recipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a grand jury investigation into 
Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators.  In order to maintain the integrity 
of the grand jury investigation and in accordance with both Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not notify 
Maxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas.  In response to receiving the Subpoenas, 
the Recipient advised the Government that it believed that certain existing 
protective orders precluded full compliance.  Accordingly, in or about February 
2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page4 of 23

5 
 
request modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with 
the Subpoenas.  In or about April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) granted the 
Government’s application, and permitted the Government to share Court-1’s 
order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further dissemination—to the 
Recipient.  Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Government’s 
application.  Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both 
Court-1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain 
under seal, except that both have expressly permitted the Government to produce 
those filings to Maxwell as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. 
6. 
After providing that factual background, the Government 
argued that Maxwell’s motion should be denied for failing to show good cause to 
modify the Protective Order for several reasons.  First, Maxwell had consented to 
the portions of the Protective Order that prohibit use of criminal discovery 
materials produced by the Government in any civil litigation.  Second, Maxwell 
had cited no authority to support the argument that a criminal defendant should be 
permitted to use criminal discovery in civil cases.  Third, Maxwell utterly failed to 
explain how the criminal discovery materials at issue supported any legal argument 
she wished to make in civil litigation.  The Government also noted that to the 
extent Maxwell sought to challenge the process by which the Government sought 
compliance with the Subpoenas and obtained certain materials that it intended to 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page5 of 23

6 
 
use in prosecuting its criminal case, she would have a full opportunity to do so in 
her pretrial motions in the criminal case before Judge Nathan.  
7. 
On August 24, 2020, Maxwell filed a reply in further support of 
her motion.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 54). 
8. 
On September 2, 2020, Judge Nathan issued the Order denying 
Maxwell’s motion.  (Ex. F).  In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite 
“fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had offered “no more 
than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions” regarding why the criminal 
discovery materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases.  (Id. at 
3).  Judge Nathan concluded that absent any “coherent explanation” of how the 
criminal discovery materials related to any argument Maxwell intended to make in 
civil litigation, Maxwell had “plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the 
Protective Order.  (Id.).  Further, Judge Nathan noted that the basic facts Maxwell 
sought to introduce in civil litigation were already made public through the 
Government’s letter in opposition to her motion.  (Id. at 3-4).  Accordingly, even 
though Judge Nathan “remain[ed] in the dark as to why this information will be 
relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, Judge Nathan expressly 
permitted Maxwell to inform the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of 
the basic series of events set forth in paragraph 5, supra.  (Id. at 4). 
9. 
On September 4, 2020, Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page6 of 23

7 
 
the Order.  (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 55).  On September 10, 2020, Maxwell filed the 
instant motion to consolidate this appeal with the appeal currently pending in 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413.  The Government is not a party to the appeal in 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, which concerns an order issued in a civil case unsealing 
materials that were previously filed under seal. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
THE APPEAL SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF 
JURISDICTION 
 
 
A. 
Applicable Law     
 
 
1. 
The Collateral Order Doctrine 
10. 
Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291 expressly limits the 
jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals to “final decisions of the district courts.”  28 
U.S.C. § 1291.  “This final judgment rule requires that a party must ordinarily raise 
all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits.  In a 
criminal case[,] the rule prohibits appellate review until conviction and imposition 
of sentence.”  Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984) (internal 
citations and quotation marks omitted); accord United States v. Aliotta, 199 F.3d 
78, 81 (2d Cir. 1999).  As the Supreme Court has “long held,” the “policy of 
Congress embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial 
court decisions which do not terminate the litigation, and . . . this policy is at its 
strongest in the field of criminal law.”  United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page7 of 23

8 
 
458 U.S. 263, 265 (1982) (per curiam); see also Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 270 (noting 
“overriding policies against interlocutory review in criminal cases” and that 
“exceptions to the final judgment rule in criminal cases are rare”); United States v. 
Culbertson, 598 F.3d 40, 46 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that “‘undue litigiousness 
and leaden-footed administration of justice,’ the common consequences of 
piecemeal appellate review, are ‘particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal 
cases’” (quoting Di Bella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 124 (1962))). 
11. 
There is a limited exception to this rule that permits immediate 
appeal from certain collateral orders.  See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 
463, 468 (1978) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 
(1949)).  To fall within the “small class” of decisions that constitute immediately 
appealable collateral orders, the decision must “(1) conclusively determine the 
disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the 
merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final 
judgment.”  Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 522 (1988) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). 
12. 
The Supreme Court has made clear that the collateral order 
exception should be “interpreted . . . with the utmost strictness in criminal cases.”  
Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265); accord United 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page8 of 23

9 
 
States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 487, 490 (2d Cir. 2007).  In over 70 years since 
Cohen was decided, despite “numerous opportunities” to expand the doctrine, 
Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799, the Supreme Court has identified only four 
types of pretrial orders in criminal cases as satisfying the collateral-order doctrine: 
an order denying a bond, Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); an order denying a 
motion to dismiss on Double Jeopardy grounds, Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 
651 (1977); an order denying a motion to dismiss under the Speech or Debate 
Clause, Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S. 500 (1979); and an order permitting the 
forced administration of antipsychotic drugs to render a defendant competent for 
trial, Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003).  In contrast, the circumstances in 
which the Supreme Court has “refused to permit interlocutory appeals” in criminal 
cases have been “far more numerous.”  Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799. 
13. 
As to the third Van Cauwenberghe criterion, “[a]n order is 
‘effectively unreviewable’ where ‘the order at issue involves an asserted right the 
legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated 
before trial.’”  United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d 1, 5 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Lauro 
Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 498-99 (1989)).  “The justification for 
immediate appeal must . . . be sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of 
deferring appeal until litigation concludes.”  Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 
U.S. 100, 107 (2009).  A ruling that is burdensome to a party “in ways that are only 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page9 of 23

10 
 
imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final district court judgment is not 
sufficient.”  Punn, 737 F.3d at 5 (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting 
Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 107).  “Instead, the decisive consideration is whether 
delaying review until the entry of final judgment ‘would imperil a substantial 
public interest’ or ‘some particular value of a high order.’”  Mohawk Indus., 558 
U.S. at 107 (quoting Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 352-53 (2006)); see also 
Kensington Int’l Ltd. v. Republic of Congo, 461 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir. 2006).  In a 
criminal case, the availability of post-judgment relief through reversal or vacatur of 
conviction, if warranted, will generally be sufficient to protect whatever right a 
defendant claims was abridged by the district court’s pretrial decision.  See, e.g., 
Punn, 737 F.3d at 14 (“Punn’s claim can be adequately vindicated upon appeal 
from a final judgment. . . . [I]f Punn’s arguments continue to fail before the district 
court, purportedly ill-gotten evidence or its fruits are admitted at his trial, and 
conviction results, appellate review will be available at that point[,] . . . [and the 
Court] may order a new trial without the use of the ill-gotten evidence, or whatever 
additional remedies are necessary to ensure that Punn’s legitimate interests are 
fully preserved.”); United States v. Hitchcock, 992 F.2d 236, 239 (9th Cir. 1993) 
(district court’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because 
“[r]eversal after trial, if it is warranted, will adequately protect . . . interest[s]” 
asserted by defendants).   
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page10 of 23

11 
 
14. 
When applying the collateral-order doctrine, the Supreme Court 
has “generally denied review of pretrial discovery orders.”  Firestone Tire & 
Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (1981).  This Court likewise has 
consistently ruled that protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged 
by the parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.  See, 
e.g., United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. 1986) (“We hold that this 
collateral protective order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 . . . .”); United 
States v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d Cir. 1996) (“To the extent that the 
[protective] order imposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materials 
exchanged in the course of pending litigation, it is not subject to appeal.”); see also 
H.L. Hayden Co. of N.Y. v. Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 90 (2d Cir. 
1986) (“The district court’s denial of modification [of a protective order] does not 
fall within the ‘collateral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”).  Because “a litigant does not 
have ‘an unrestrained right to disseminate information that has been obtained 
through pretrial discovery,’” such protective orders do not amount to an 
impermissible prior restraint under the First Amendment.  Caparros, 800 F.2d at 
25 (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 31 (1984)).  Even where a 
litigant raises a colorable argument that a protective order violates a litigant’s right 
to release documents outside of criminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right 
can await final judgment on the underlying charges” because the “purported right 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page11 of 23

12 
 
at issue is not related to any right not to stand trial.”  Id. at 26. 
 
 
2. 
Appeals Involving Injunctions 
15. 
Title 28, United States Code, Section 1292(a)(1) provides that 
Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory orders of the district 
courts of the United States . . . or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, 
modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify 
injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.”  
Orders regulating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched “using words of 
restraint,” are not injunctions and are therefore not appealable under § 1292(a)(1).  
See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (“Protective orders that only regulate materials 
exchanged between the parties incident to litigation, like most discovery orders, are 
neither final orders, appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, nor injunctions, appealable 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).” (internal citations omitted)); Caparros, 800 F.2d at 
26.   
B. 
Discussion 
16. 
There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and 
thus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that 
constitute immediately appealable collateral orders.  Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. 
at 522.  Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrow category of 
collateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page12 of 23

13 
 
rule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be 
dismissed.  Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).  
Among other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for 
identifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order 
being appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final 
judgment.”  Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omitted) 
(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468).  Accordingly, this Court does not 
have jurisdiction to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed. 
17. 
As an initial matter, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this 
Court cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts 
of this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim 
belongs.”  Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 
Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, 
Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 868 (1994)).  Here, like any other order regulating the use of 
discovery materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s 
Order declining to modify the Protective Order in this criminal case is not subject 
to interlocutory appeal.  See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 800 F.2d at 24-26.   
18. 
There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within 
the four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable 
prejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy, 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page13 of 23

14 
 
the Speech or Debate Clause, or the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs.  
See Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799; Sell, 539 U.S. at 176-77.  The rights 
implicated here do not meet the high threshold of expanding the collateral order 
exception in criminal cases beyond those limited categories.  Rather, this Order 
falls within the category of rulings addressing pretrial discovery, which are 
generally unreviewable on interlocutory appeal.  See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; 
Caparros, 800 F.2d at 24-26.  Maxwell has identified no public interest or value 
that is “sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until 
litigation concludes.”  Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 107. 
19. 
Maxwell seems to claim that reversal of Judge Nathan’s Order 
is necessary in order to prevent documents in a civil case from being unsealed.  
Even assuming a presentation of criminal discovery materials would affect an 
unsealing decision in a civil case — an argument that Judge Nathan found 
speculative at best (Ex. F at 3) — a risk of unsealing is not significant enough to 
merit interlocutory appeal.  See United States v. Martoma, No. 13-4807, 2014 WL 
68119, at *1 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2014) (concluding that even though the defendant’s 
“personal interest in the privacy of embarrassing information is an interest that, as 
a practical matter, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that interest is 
insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal); United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d 
990, 998 (9th Cir. 2012) (finding no jurisdiction over defendant’s interlocutory 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page14 of 23

15 
 
appeal from unsealing of competency evaluation because “any alleged incursions 
on criminal defendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not render the unsealing 
order effectively unreviewable on appeal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district 
court’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because “[r]eversal 
after trial, if it is warranted, will adequately protect . . . interest[s]” asserted by 
defendant); cf. Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 109 (holding that orders to disclose 
privileged information are not immediately appealable even though they “intrude[] 
on the confidentiality of attorney-client communications”). 
20. 
To the extent Maxwell complains that unsealing filings in a 
civil case may result in unfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, such a concern 
is not an issue that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.  
Indeed, that very issue has been reviewed by this Court in multiple cases on post-
judgment appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d 
Cir. 2010) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased the 
venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 515 F.3d 100, 128-31 (2d Cir. 2008) (evaluating 
on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial jurors).  Should the Court 
determine that the jury at Maxwell’s trial was biased based on disclosure of 
material in a civil case, and that such material would not have been unsealed had 
Judge Nathan permitted modification of the Protective Order, then vacatur of the 
defendant’s conviction – if warranted – will adequately vindicate the defendant’s 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page15 of 23

16 
 
right to an impartial jury.  See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d 164, 201-04, 
213 (2d Cir. 2002) (vacating conviction where district court improperly refused to 
excuse potential juror who admitted bias based upon knowledge of defendant’s 
previous acquittal).  Thus, the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury would 
not “be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. 
at 799 (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435 
U.S. 850, 860 (1978)), and, as such, the Order does not meet the third criterion for 
appealability of a collateral order. See Punn, 737 F.3d at 14 (defendant’s interests 
“can be adequately vindicated upon appeal from a final judgment” through “a new 
trial . . . or whatever additional remedies are necessary”). 
21. 
Simply put, the Order denying Maxwell’s motion to amend the 
Protective Order is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal.  Maxwell complains 
that if she cannot use criminal discovery materials in civil litigation then there is a 
risk that certain filings in the civil cases may be unsealed that otherwise would 
have remained sealed.  Maxwell apparently believes such a result would risk 
prejudicing her trial rights in the criminal case.  If such materials are unsealed in 
the civil case, and if Maxwell believes that unsealing causes her prejudice at her 
criminal trial, Maxwell will have a full opportunity to raise that issue in the 
criminal case.  To the extent Maxwell is concerned that unsealing in the civil case 
might permit the Government to oppose any motion challenging the unsealing 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page16 of 23

17 
 
order it obtained during its criminal investigation on the grounds of inevitable 
discovery, she will have the opportunity to assert such a claim before Judge 
Nathan.  If she is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s decision on that score, she can 
raise the issue on appeal after the entry of final judgment. 
22. 
Further, given the substance of Maxwell’s motion to 
consolidate, it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in 
this appeal have been finally resolved.  Maxwell’s motion to consolidate this 
matter with the Giuffre v. Maxwell appeal appears primarily focused on attacking 
the legitimacy of the Government’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends 
to use to prosecute the criminal case through the Subpoenas to the Recipient.  (See 
Mot. at 10-12).  It thus seems readily apparent that Maxwell intends to file a 
motion to preclude the use of such evidence at her criminal trial.  Yet she seeks to 
have this Court reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the 
civil appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by 
the District Court in the criminal case.  As Judge Nathan has not yet addressed (or 
even had the opportunity to address) that issue in the criminal case, the issues 
Maxwell raises on this appeal do not appear to be final.  Any such arguments are 
properly heard in the criminal case in the first instance by the district judge, “who 
play[s] a ‘special role’ in managing ongoing litigation,” and who “can better 
exercise [his or her] responsibility [to police the prejudment tactics of litigants] if 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page17 of 23

18 
 
the appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment 
rulings.”   Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 106 (alterations in original) (internal quotation 
mark omitted) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 
472 U.S. 424, 436 (1985)). 
23. 
The cases cited in Maxwell’s notice of appeal do not alter this 
analysis.  All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors — 
not parties — seeking to modify protective orders in civil cases.  See Pichler v. 
UNITE, 585 F.3d 741, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2009) (third party intervernor foundation 
appealing order denying motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to 
allow third party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity 
Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 741 (2d Cir. 1987) (Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (“CFTC”) acting as third party intervenor appealing order denying 
motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to allow CFTC to obtain 
discovery exchanged by parties to civil case permissible because “[t]he entire 
controversy between the CFTC and the defendants in this case was disposed of by 
the district court’s denial of the government’s motion to modify the protective 
order”); Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 46 (2d Cir. 2019) (third party intervenors, 
including members of the press, appealing order denying motion to modify 
protective order in civil litigation to allow third parties access to sealed filings, 
after parties to the litigation settled).  Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those cases 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page18 of 23

19 
 
was founded on the principle that when intervenors seek access to sealed records, 
“orders denying access are final as to the intervenors.”  Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of 
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasis added).  By contrast, 
rulings governing the parties’ use of discovery materials — such as Judge Nathan’s 
Order here — are not appealable in the context of a criminal prosecution until after 
judgment is entered.  See Caparros, 800 F.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. 
24. 
Judge Nathan’s Order does not fall into one of the narrow 
categories of decisions in a criminal case reviewable on interlocutory appeal.  
Accordingly, Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed. 
II. 
THE MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE SHOULD BE DENIED 
25. 
Even if Maxwell’s appeal is not dismissed — which it should 
be — her motion to consolidate the appeal in this criminal case with the appeal in 
the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case should be denied. 
26. 
Despite Maxwell’s efforts to characterize this criminal case as 
somehow intertwined with the Giuffre civil case, the issues on appeal are factually 
and legally distinct.  The civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s order unsealing civil 
litigation materials. The Government is not a party to the civil suit, the 
Government has never intervened or appeared in the civil suit, the Government has 
had no role in the litigation that resulted in Judge Preska’s order, and the 
Government has no legal interest in the relief Maxwell seeks in the civil case.  For 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page19 of 23

20 
 
these reasons alone, the Court should deny Maxwell’s motion to consolidate these 
appeals.  
27. 
Maxwell has filed two separate appeals challenging two 
different orders by two different district judges.  But Maxwell’s consolidation 
motion makes plain that her goal — in both appeals — is to ask this Court to rule 
on an entirely different question: the lawfulness of the Government’s applications 
to modify certain protective orders in other judicial proceedings.  Maxwell’s 
strategy is procedurally improper, for at least two reasons.  First, none of the 
applications or orders with which Maxwell takes issue are before this Court for 
review — the civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s unsealing order, and this 
criminal appeal concerns Judge Nathan’s Order denying Maxwell’s request to 
modify the Protective Order.  Maxwell’s motion to consolidate offers no coherent 
explanation of the connection between the legality of the Government’s prior 
applications and those two appeals.  Indeed, as Judge Nathan found, Maxwell has 
failed to explain, despite a high volume of “heated rhetoric,” how those 
applications could have any possible impact on Judge Preska’s decision to unseal 
filings in the civil litigation.   (Ex. F at 3).  Second, if Maxwell seeks to challenge 
the manner in which the Government gathered evidence in a criminal investigation, 
neither the civil appeal nor this interlocutory criminal appeal is the appropriate 
forum for her arguments on that score.  Maxwell will have the opportunity to raise 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page20 of 23

21 
 
any legal objections to the Government’s evidence before Judge Nathan, who is 
presiding over the criminal case.  If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s 
rulings on those matters, she will have a full opportunity to appeal those rulings 
after entry of final judgment in her criminal case.  The Court should not permit 
Maxwell to raise these issues at this juncture, before they have been fully litigated 
before and adjudicated by the presiding district judge. 
28. 
Moreover, Maxwell’s motion to consolidate is a transparent 
attempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this 
appeal.  That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits 
Maxwell from using certain criminal discovery materials in civil litigation.  If this 
Court were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in 
both cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in 
the manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge 
Nathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without 
requiring Maxwell to show that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by 
denying Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.2  Indeed, Maxwell’s 
motion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left 
                                                 
2 Moreover, if the appeals were consolidated, the sealed filings in this criminal 
appeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal.  The Government is 
concerned that consolidating these matters would entail disseminating sensitive, 
sealed documents in a criminal case to civil litigants. 
Case 20-3061, Document 38, 09/16/2020, 2932233, Page21 of 23

22 
 
for this Court to adjudicate regarding Judge Nathan’s Order — the lone Order on 
appeal in this matter — if the Court were to grant Maxwell’s request to consolidate 
these appeals.  Accordingly, the motion to consolidate should be denied.  
CONCLUSION 
29. 
For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s appeal should be 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  If the appeal is not dismissed, the Government 
respectfully requests that the Court deny Maxwell’s motion for consolidation.

The government and Ms. Giuffre insist this case and the criminal case are 
unrelated. But that’s not so. 
The criminal case alleges that Ms. Maxwell committed perjury in the civil 
case. Two of the six counts are expressly based on the civil case. 
Moreover, 
 
 
 
 It’s fanciful to say the two cases aren’t related. 
The government says it “is not a party to the civil suit” (true), that it “has 
never intervened or appeared in the civil suit” (also true), that it “has had no role 
in the litigation that resulted in Judge Preska’s order” (true again), and that it has 
no “legal interest in the relief Maxwell seeks in the civil case” (true and 
extraordinarily revealing). Doc. 113, ¶ 26. 
The government has not intervened in the civil case and it does not have an 
interest in the relief Ms. Maxwell seeks (keeping the deposition material sealed) 
because the government wants to argue that its violation of Martindell was harmless 
as soon as the April 2016 deposition transcript is released. After all, if the 
government were being consistent, it would have moved to intervene in the civil 
Case 20-3061, Document 54, 09/23/2020, 2937091, Page2 of 6

 
 
3
case and to stay the unsealing process, just as it moved to intervene and to stay 
discovery in Doe v. Indyke, a civil case in which Jane Doe alleges that Epstein and 
Ms. Maxwell abused and exploited her as a minor. According to the government, a 
stay of that case was necessary to “preserv[e] the integrity of the criminal 
prosecution against [Ms.] Maxwell.” Doe v. Indyke et al., No. 20-cv-00484, Doc. 
81, p 4, 9/14/2020 Order Granting Motion to Stay. The court there agreed, and it 
granted Ms. Maxwell’s motion to stay. Id. at 12. This Court should not let the 
government engage in such obvious gamesmanship. 
The government insists that, in these two appeals, Ms. Maxwell is “ask[ing] 
this Court to rule on . . . the lawfulness of the Government’s applications to modify 
certain protective orders in other judicial proceedings.” Doc. 113, ¶ 27. That is not 
so. The government’s contention mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument. 
As Ms. Maxwell said in her opening brief: 
The civil case is not the appropriate forum to litigate the 
government’s apparent violation of Martindell. Ms. Maxwell intends 
to make that argument to Judge Nathan in the criminal case. But if 
Judge Preska’s unsealing order is affirmed and Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition is released, her ability to make that argument before Judge 
Nathan will be prejudiced. Keeping the deposition material sealed will 
preserve the status quo and protect Ms. Maxwell’s right to litigate 
Martindell and the Fifth Amendment in the criminal proceeding.  
Doc. 69, p 33. Only by mischaracterizing Ms. Maxwell’s argument can the 
government contend that she is “ask[ing] this Court to rule on . . . the lawfulness of 
Case 20-3061, Document 54, 09/23/2020, 2937091, Page3 of 6

 
 
4
the Government’s applications to modify certain protective orders in other judicial 
proceedings.” Ms. Maxwell’s point is that, unless the unsealing order is reversed, 
she might not ever be able to litigate “the lawfulness of the Government’s 
applications.”  
Moreover, the motion to consolidate is not an attempt to circumvent Judge 
Nathan’s order before this Court can reach the merits. The motion to consolidate 
simply endeavors to ensure that this Court does not find itself in the same position 
as the several judges below, where only some of the judges are privy to the relevant 
facts. 
There is no merit to Ms. Giuffre’s argument that consolidation will cause 
meaningful delay. Doc. 123, pp 4–5. This Court has scheduled oral argument in 
both cases on the same day, as well as an argument on the motion to consolidate. 
Whether that motion is granted or not will have no effect on the dispatch with 
which this Court addresses the issues. 
This Court should grant the motion to consolidate.

Statement of the Case and the Facts 
The indictment. 
In a superseding indictment, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell: 
conspired with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts 
(Count 1); enticed a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts (Count 2); 
conspired with Epstein to transport minors with the intent to engage in criminal 
sexual activity (Count 3); transported a minor with the intent to engage in criminal 
sexual activity (Count 4); committed perjury in the April 2016 deposition in Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y) (Count 5); and committed perjury in the July 
2016 deposition in Giuffre v. Maxwell (Count 6). App. 13–30. 
The civil case. 
Giuffre v. Maxwell is a long-dismissed defamation case in which Virginia L. 
Giuffre alleged that Ms. Maxwell defamed her. The alleged defamation centered on 
a statement from Ms. Maxwell’s attorney-hired press agent generally denying as 
“untrue” and “obvious lies” plaintiff’s numerous allegations, over the span of four 
years, that Ms. Maxwell participated in a scheme causing her to be “sexually 
abused and trafficked” by Epstein. The case settled after discovery and before trial, 
and the district court dismissed the case with prejudice in May 2017. 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page6 of 58

 
2
Ms. Maxwell sat for two depositions during discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
the transcripts of which were both designated “confidential” under a court-
ordered protective order. App. 154–59. The transcripts of both depositions were 
filed with the court during the course of the case and sealed by the court under the 
terms of the protective order. 
In turn, the civil protective order prohibited attorneys and parties from 
sharing confidential information, including Ms. Maxwell’s depositions, with any 
third party, except as necessary for the preparation and trial of the case. App. 155–
56.  
As originally proposed by Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys, the protective order 
would have allowed plaintiff to share confidential information with law 
enforcement. App. 125. Ms. Maxwell objected to this language, which was removed 
and never made part of a court order. App. 125 & n.4.  
The subpoena. 
So if the civil protective order did not allow plaintiff to share confidential 
information with law enforcement, and Ms. Maxwell did not provide the 
government with her deposition transcripts (which she didn’t), how did the 
government obtain them and bring a criminal indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell 
committed perjury?

 Judge Preska, who, after the passing of 
Judge Sweet, was assigned to preside over the remand from this Court in Brown to 
decide what material protected by the civil protective order should remain sealed.1 
 
 
 repeatedly downplayed and dismissed 
arguments made by Ms. Maxwell that the material should remain sealed because of 
the potential for a criminal investigation. Doc. 17, pp 4–5; Doc. 20, p 2.2 For 
example, when Ms. Maxwell moved to stay discovery in Farmer v. Indyke, No. 19-
cv-10475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y.), due to the pending criminal investigation, Ms. 
Giuffre’s attorneys (who also represented plaintiff Annie Farmer) opposed the 
motion on the ground that Ms. Maxwell could not show the existence or scope of

any such criminal investigation
 
: 
Maxwell has provided no information about the subject matter of the 
criminal investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the 
investigation, or even disclosed whether she herself is a target of the 
Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel asked 
Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation 
during their meet and confer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide 
any details.

unsealing process. Doc. 17, p 6. But because of the criminal protective order issued 
by Judge Nathan, all Ms. Maxwell could reveal to Judge Preska was that she was 
aware of critical new information. Doc. 17, p 6. She couldn’t tell Judge Preska what 
that information was. Doc. 17, p 6. 
Judge Preska declined to stay the unsealing process but said she would 
reevaluate if Judge Nathan modified the criminal protective order and allowed Ms. 
Maxwell to share with Judge Preska, under seal, all she had learned as described 
above. Doc. 17, p 6. 
The order declining to modify the criminal protective order.  
At Judge Preska’s suggestion, Ms. Maxwell filed a motion with Judge 
Nathan seeking modification of the criminal protective order. App. 124–31. All the 
motion asked was for permission to share with Judge Preska and with this Court, 
under seal, what Ms. Maxwell had learned

The appeals.  
Pending before this Court in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413 (2d Cir.), is Ms. 
Maxwell’s appeal of Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition material. 
This appeal is from Judge Nathan’s order denying Ms. Maxwell’s motion to 
modify the criminal protective order to share with Judge Preska and this Court in 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, under seal, 
 
 
 App. 121. 
Ms. Maxwell has moved to consolidate both appeals. That motion remains

Jurisdictional Statement 
This Court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review a 
district court decision declining to modify the protective order. Pichler v. UNITE, 
585 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (3d Cir. 2009) (“We have jurisdiction under the collateral 
order doctrine to review the denial of the motion to modify the Protective Order 
and the denial of the motion to reconsider.”); Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity 
Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. 1987) (denial of motion to modify protective 
order is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine) (citing Cohen v. 
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545–47 (1949)); see also Brown v. 
Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 44 (2d Cir. 2019) (appeal by intervenors challenging denial of 
motions to modify protective order and unseal). 
Under the collateral order doctrine, an interlocutory order is immediately 
appealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an 
important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) is 
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 
345, 349 (2006) (citing Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 
506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993)). 
The district court’s order declining to modify the protective order meets all 
three requirements: the court conclusively decided not to modify the protective

11
order, App. 99–103; the propriety of modifying the protective order is completely 
separate from the merits of the government’s criminal allegations against Ms. 
Maxwell; and appellate review of the order will be impossible following final 
judgment because a post-judgment appeal will be moot since, by that time, Judge 
Preska’s decision unsealing the deposition material in Giuffre v. Maxwell, Nos. 20-
2413 (2d Cir.)/15-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.) will have gone into effect.  
That is the very point of this appeal, after all: to share with Judge Preska 
what Ms. Maxwell learned from 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What’s more, all of this happened while the 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page16 of 58

 
12
civil case was on appeal and pending before this Court.3 Brown v. Maxwell, No. 18-
2868. All Ms. Maxwell asks is for permission to share, under seal, the relevant facts 
with another Article III judge.  
The government argues there is no jurisdiction for this Court to consider this 
appeal. Doc. 37. Quoting Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, the government 
says the collateral order doctrine must be interpreted “with the utmost strictness in 
criminal cases.” 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) (quoting Flanagan v. United States, 465 
U.S. 259, 265 (1984)). Doc. 37 at 8. According to the government, in criminal cases 
the doctrine applies only to orders denying a bond, orders denying a motion to 
dismiss on double jeopardy ground, orders denying a motion to dismiss under the 
Speech and Debate Clause, and orders permitting the forced administration of 
antipsychotic drugs to render a defendant competent for trial. Doc. 37 at 9. The 
government is wrong.  
To be sure, this appeal does not concern one of the four types of orders 
identified by the government. But that doesn’t mean the appeal isn’t proper under 
 
3 The Miami Herald filed its notice of appeal in Brown v. Maxwell, No. 18-
2868 (2d Cir.), on September 26, 2018, and this Court issued its decision on July 3, 
2019, Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41 (2d Cir.2019).

the collateral order doctrine, particularly when there is no serious argument that it 
satisfies each of the doctrine’s three requirements: Judge Nathan’s order (1) 
conclusively determined the disputed question, (2) it resolved an important issue 
completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) it is effectively 
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See Will, 546 U.S. at 349. 
In Flanagan v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that an order 
disqualifying criminal counsel pretrial was not immediately appealable under the 
collateral order doctrine. 465 U.S. 259, 266 (1984). The Court explained that unlike 
an order denying a motion to reduce bail, which “becomes moot if review awaits 
conviction and sentence,” an order disqualifying counsel is fully remediable 
posttrial. Id. Moreover, a motion to disqualify counsel is “not independent of the 
issues to be tried” because its “validity cannot be adequately reviewed until trial is 
complete.” Id. at 268. Finally, unlike an appeal of a bail decision, “an appeal of a 
disqualification order interrupts the trial,” and any delay in a criminal case “exacts 
a presumptively prohibitive price.” Id. at 269. 
In contrast to the disqualification order at issue in Flanagan, the appeal of 
Judge Nathan’s order is like the appeal of an order denying a motion to reduce bail. 
First, this appeal will “become[] moot if review awaits conviction and sentence.” 
See id. at 266. Unless Ms. Maxwell is permitted to share with Judge Preska what 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page18 of 58

 
14
she learned from Judge Nathan, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition 
material will go into effect without Judge Preska’s having the opportunity to 
reconsider her decision in light of the new information. And once the deposition 
material is unsealed, the cat is irretrievably out of the bag. That is precisely why 
this Court stayed Judge Preska’s order pending appeal. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-
2413 (2d Cir.), Doc. 30. 
Second, the appeal of Judge Nathan’s order is entirely “independent of the 
issues to be tried” in the criminal case and its “validity can[] be adequately 
reviewed” now. See Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 268. There is nothing about Ms. 
Maxwell’s request to share information with Judge Preska that must wait until the 
criminal trial is over. To the contrary, waiting until the criminal trial is over will 
moot the issue. 
Third, this appeal does not and will not delay the criminal case, which is 
proceeding apace notwithstanding the proceedings before this Court. See id. at 264 
(explaining that interlocutory appeals in criminal cases are generally disfavored 
because of the “societal interest in providing a speedy trial”).4 
 
4 The fact that the criminal case is proceeding on course despite this appeal 
confirms that this appeal involves an issue completely separate from the merits of 
the criminal action. 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page19 of 58

 
15 
The government’s contentions to the contrary rely on two easily 
distinguishable cases and misunderstand Ms. Maxwell’s arguments. Start with the 
two cases on which the government relies. Doc. 37, p 11 (citing United States v. 
Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798 
(2d Cir. 1996)). According to the government, Caparros and Pappas hold that 
“protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged by the parties 
during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.” Doc. 37, p 11. That 
is not correct. 
In Caparros, this Court dismissed an appeal of a protective order issued in a 
criminal case preventing the defendant from making public certain documents 
allegedly concerning public safety. 800 F.2d at 23–24. According to the defendant, 
the prohibition on public disclosure was an unconstitutional prior restraint of 
speech. Id. at 24. This Court dismissed the appeal because it did not satisfy the 
three conditions precedent to interlocutory review, in particular the requirement 
that the issue must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Id. 
at 24–26. Said the Court: 
[The issue] will not become moot on conviction and sentence or on 
acquittal because the order will have continuing prohibitive effect 
thereafter and the purported right to publish the documents, to the 
extent it now exists, will also continue. This is not a situation where an 
order, to be reviewed at all, must be reviewed before the proceedings 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page20 of 58

 
16
terminate. Nor is there any allegation of grave harm to appellant if the 
order is not immediately reviewed. 
Id. at 26 (internal citations omitted). 
 
This case is not like Caparros. For one thing, Ms. Maxwell does not seek to 
make anything public. To the contrary, she seeks to provide documents to judicial 
officers—under seal—to ensure that all the Article III decisionmakers are on the 
same page regarding the relevant facts and that Judge Preska does not continue to 
remain in the dark. For another thing, this appeal will become moot if review awaits 
a final judgment in the criminal case, even if the protective order continues to have 
prohibitive effect following the criminal trial. That’s because what Ms. Maxwell 
seeks is permission to share information with Judge Preska now, information that 
should be part of Judge Preska’s decisionmaking in the unsealing process and any 
decision whether to stay that process. And unless Ms. Maxwell can share the 
information now, the request will become moot because there is no way to “re-
seal” a document Judge Preska prematurely unseals without the benefit of knowing 
all the facts.  
Pappas also doesn’t help the government. In Pappas, this Court dismissed in 
part an appeal challenging a protective order prohibiting the defendant from 
disclosing classified information he obtained from the government as part of 
discovery. 94 F.3d at 797. At the same time, the Court accepted jurisdiction over the 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page21 of 58

 
17
portion of the appeal that challenged the protective order’s bar on disclosure of 
information the defendant acquired from the government prior to the litigation. Id. 
at 798. This Court distinguished the differing results based on the breadth of the 
protective order’s ban. Id. As this Court said, “to the extent that the order 
prohibits Pappas from disclosure of information he acquired from the Government 
prior to the litigation, the order is not a typical protective order regulating 
discovery documents and should be appealable because of the breadth of its 
restraint.” Id. (citing United States v. Salameh, 992 F.2d 445, 446–47 (2d Cir. 
1993)). 
Beyond standing for the proposition that interlocutory appeals are the 
exception and not the rule (which Ms. Maxwell doesn’t dispute), Pappas has 
nothing to add to the analysis here. Even strictly construing the three requirements 
for collateral order jurisdiction, see Will, 546 U.S. at 349, the order here meets the 
test. 
The balance of the government’s argument against jurisdiction 
misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s position. For example, according to the 
government, “it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in 
this appeal have been finally resolved.” Doc. 37, p 17. Ms. Maxwell’s argument, 
says the government, is “primarily focused on attacking the legitimacy of the 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page22 of 58

 
18
Government’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends to use to prosecute 
the criminal case through the Subpoenas to” 
 Doc. 37, p 17. Based on 
this understanding, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell “seeks to have this 
Court reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the civil 
appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by the 
District Court in the criminal case.” Doc. 37, p 17 (emphasis in original). That is 
not so. 
In the civil appeal, Ms. Maxwell is not asking this Court to rule on the 
propriety of the government’s conduct in circumventing Martindell and obtaining 
her depositions in a secret ex parte proceeding without providing Ms. Maxwell 
notice and an opportunity to be heard.  
Rather, Ms. Maxwell’s argument in the civil appeal is that, unless this Court 
reverses Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition material, Ms. Maxwell may 
never be able to challenge before Judge Nathan the government’s conduct in 
obtaining her depositions. As Ms. Maxwell said in her opening brief in the appeal of 
Judge Preska’s unsealing order: 
The civil case is not the appropriate forum to litigate the 
government’s apparent violation of Martindell. Ms. Maxwell intends 
to make that argument to Judge Nathan in the criminal case. But if 
Judge Preska’s unsealing order is affirmed and Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition is released, her ability to make that argument before Judge 
Nathan will be prejudiced. Keeping the deposition material sealed will 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page23 of 58

 
19
preserve the status quo and protect Ms. Maxwell’s right to litigate 
Martindell and the Fifth Amendment in the criminal proceeding.  
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, ECF Dkt. 69, p 33. Only by mischaracterizing Ms. 
Maxwell’s argument can the government contend that she “seeks to have this 
Court reach the merits of her arguments on [the Martindell] issue in the context of 
the civil appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated 
by the District Court in the criminal case.” See Doc. 37, p 17. Ms. Maxwell’s point 
is that, unless the unsealing order is reversed, Ms. Maxwell likely won’t be able to 
“properly litigate” the Martindell issue at all.  
 
Nor is this appeal the proper forum for deciding whether the government 
improperly circumvented Martindell. All Ms. Maxwell seeks here is an order 
allowing her to share with Judge Preska information that is essential to her decision 
to unseal the deposition material and to rule on a motion to stay, information Judge 
Preska did not know at the time and information the government insists should be 
kept from her. And that issue—whether it is proper for one Article III judge, at the 
request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information 
relevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a matter before her—is 
properly reviewed on an interlocutory basis because it is “an important issue 
completely separate from the merits of the action.” Will, 546 U.S. at 349. 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page24 of 58

 
20
Assuming Ms. Maxwell cannot appeal Judge Nathan’s order under the 
collateral order doctrine, this Court should exercise mandamus jurisdiction and 
issue a writ of mandamus directing the district court to modify the protective order 
as requested by Ms. Maxwell. E.g., Wilk v. Am. Med. Ass’n, 635 F.2d 1295, 1298 
(7th Cir. 1980) (declining to decide whether the collateral order applied and instead 
issuing a writ of mandamus to vacate a district court decision declining to modify 
protective order), superseded by rule on other grounds as recognized in Bond v. Utreras, 
585 F.3d 1061, 1068 n.4 (7th Cir. 2009); see Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (recognizing that 
protective orders in criminal cases “[i]n rare instances . . . might raise issues 
available for review via a petition for writ of mandamus”). 
A writ of mandamus issued under the All Writs Act “confine[s] the court 
against which mandamus is sought to a lawful exercise of its prescribed 
jurisdiction.” In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal 
quotations omitted). A writ is properly issued when “exceptional circumstances 
amount[] to a . . . clear abuse of discretion.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). 
Three conditions must exist for this Court to issue a writ of mandamus:  
(1) the petitioner must demonstrate the right to issuance of the writ is clear and 
indisputable; (2) she must have no other adequate means to attain the relief 
desired; and (3) the issuing court must be satisfied the writ is appropriate. In re 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page25 of 58

 
21
Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany, N.Y., 745 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2014). All three 
conditions exist here. 
First, as elaborated below, Judge Nathan clearly abused her discretion in 
declining to modify the protective order.  
Second, Ms. Maxwell has no other adequate means to attain the relief 
necessary because her request for Judge Preska to reevaluate her unsealing order 
with the benefit of knowing what everyone else knows
 
 
will become moot once the deposition 
material is unsealed (as this Court already recognized by staying the unsealing 
order pending appeal). 
Finally, it is appropriate for this Court to issue a writ of mandamus because, 
as explained in Ms. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate, the judges in the Southern 
District of New York have reached inconsistent decisions to prejudice of Ms. 
Maxwell. And while there is no dispute Ms. Maxwell has the right to appeal Judge 
Preska’s order, 
 
 
 And now the government is trying to prevent Ms. Maxwell from 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page26 of 58

 
22 
appealing Judge Nathan’s order. A writ of mandamus is appropriate because only 
this Court can guarantee that all the judges below are on the same page. 
Issue Presented 
Whether Judge Nathan erred in refusing to modify the protective order for 
the limited purpose of allowing Ms. Maxwell to share with Judge Preska, under 
seal, 
.  
Summary of the Argument 
This Court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. Judge 
Nathan’s order (1) completely resolved whether the criminal protective order 
should be modified, (2) that question is an important issue completely separate 
from the merits of the action, and (3) it is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a 
final judgment. Alternatively, mandamus review is appropriate to resolve the 
conflicting decisions below. 
On the merits, this Court should permit modification of the criminal order so 
Ms. Maxwell can share with Judge Preska, under seal, just how the government 
came to possess her deposition transcripts, 
 
. At this point, Judge Preska is the only relevant 
participant who doesn’t know this information. If Judge Preska’s order unsealing 
the deposition transcript goes into effect without Judge Preska being offered an 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page27 of 58

 
23 
opportunity to reevaluate her decision in light of this information, Ms. Maxwell 
may never be able to challenge in the criminal case the government’s violation of 
her rights under Martindell. Likewise, if Judge Preska is asked to rule on a motion to 
stay the unsealing until the conclusion of the criminal case without knowledge that 
the sealed materials 
, Ms. Maxwell 
will never be able to challenge that decision.  A modification of the protective order 
will not prejudice the government, which has not articulated a persuasive reason 
why Judge Preska should remain in the dark. 
Argument 
I. Judge Nathan erred in refusing to modify the protective order for the 
limited purpose of allowing Ms. Maxwell to share with Judge Preska, 
under seal, material information 
 
 
This appeal is one part of an extraordinary series of events in which six sets 
of judicial officers are trying to resolve related—sometimes inextricably 
interrelated—legal questions involving one common party: Ghislaine Maxwell. 
Those six sets of judicial officers are four district judges 
 
 and two panels of this Court (the panel 
presiding over Giuffre v. Maxwell and the panel presiding over this interlocutory 
appeal). Yet because of Ms. Maxwell’s legal opponents’ tactical choices, no one set 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page28 of 58

 
24 
of judicial officers has before it the full picture of the facts relevant to the 
controversies it is trying to resolve.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, a forty-year-old decision from this 
Court squarely holds that the government seeking access to court-protected 
documents in a civil case to which it is not a party must follow certain procedures 
to request those documents, yet the government here declined to follow those 
procedures. 
Adding to the extraordinary, Ms. Maxwell is the only person with interests in 
all six of the judicial proceedings and with at least some knowledge of all of them. 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page29 of 58

 
25
She is trying to ensure that each of the judicial officers in the active cases has the 
information from the related cases relevant to his or her decisions. Despite her 
efforts, she has been stymied by seal orders 
 
 and by the protective order in the criminal case. 
Ms. Maxwell is in a Catch-22 situation. Judge Preska is presiding over the 
unsealing of materials subject to the civil protective order. She does not 
 
 
 
 
 Judge Nathan’s protective order, 
which prohibits her from sharing that information with Judge Preska. Ms. Maxwell 
asked Judge Preska to stay the unseal proceedings so that Ms. Maxwell could 
secure permission to share criminal-protective-order confidential information, but 
Judge Preska said there was no factual basis to grant a stay. Ms. Maxwell asked 
Judge Nathan for permission to share information under seal with Judge Preska, a 
co-equal Article III judge, but Judge Nathan denied the request. 
Meanwhile, in this Court, the Giuffre v. Maxwell panel lacks the same 
information Judge Preska did not have when she issued the unseal order that is the 
subject of the appeal, and the United States v. Maxwell panel lacks the context of the 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page30 of 58

 
26 
Giuffre v. Maxwell unseal proceedings, into which Ms. Maxwell seeks to introduce 
criminal protective order-sealed information relevant to Judge Preska’s unseal 
decisions. 
This situation is fundamentally unfair to Ms. Maxwell. There is no reason all 
judicial officers presiding over any case implicating Ms. Maxwell’s interests should 
not have access, whether under seal, in camera, or otherwise, to all relevant 
information, and there is no reason Ms. Maxwell should be barred from providing 
such relevant information to them. 
A. Preservation and standard of review. 
Ms. Maxwell preserved this issue for appeal. App. 124–31, 293–98. 
This Court reviews for an abuse of discretion an order denying a motion to 
modify a protective order. Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295. A district court by definition 
abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law. Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 
81, 100 (1996). 
B. The district court erred in declining to modify the protective order. 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1) authorizes district courts to 
enter or modify protective orders for good cause. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1). In this 
case, several reasons exist for the narrow modification of the criminal protective 
order Ms. Maxwell proposes.  
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page31 of 58

 
27 
First, Judge Preska might well reconsider her decision to unseal the 
deposition material if she knew how the government obtained the material despite 
the civil protective order.5 In particular, keeping the deposition material sealed 
preserves Ms. Maxwell’s ability to litigate before Judge Nathan in the criminal case 
the propriety of the government’s circumvention of this Court’s decision in 
Martindell, which expressly contemplates an affected party’s right to move to 
quash a grand jury subpoena seeking access to information shielded by a valid 
protective order. Martindell, 524 F.2d at 294. If the deposition material is unsealed, 
Judge Preska will never have the opportunity to reconsider her decision armed with 
the knowledge 
 
 
And if the deposition material is unsealed, it may foreclose any argument from Ms. 
Maxwell to Judge Nathan that the perjury counts should be dismissed or other 
remedies imposed based on the government’s circumvention of Martindell. All Ms. 
 
5 It’s irrelevant that Ms. Maxwell originally consented to the provision of the 
criminal protective order that presently prevents her from sharing with Judge 
Preska 
 
 App. 91–92. At the time Ms. Maxwell consented to that provision
 
 
 
 Ms. Maxwell’s earlier consent to this provision in the 
protective order does not bear on whether good cause exist for its modification. 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page32 of 58

28 
Maxwell seeks in this appeal is the ability to make these arguments to Judge Preska 
and Judge Nathan before it’s too late.  
Second, to preserve her fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial by an 
impartial jury, Ms. Maxwell intends to move to stay the unsealing process before 
Judge Preska. Ample authority supports staying a civil case pending resolution of a 
related criminal matter. E.g., Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 
83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012). But Ms. Maxwell cannot fairly make her case before Judge 
Preska for a stay unless Judge Preska knows all the relevant facts. 
In particular, a central consideration in deciding whether to stay a civil case 
pending resolution of a criminal case is “the extent to which the issues in the 
criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil case.” Id. (quoting Trs. of 
Plumbers & Pipefitters Nat’l Pension Fund v. Transworld Mech., Inc., 886 F. Supp. 
1134, 1139 (S.D.N.Y.1995)). Here, there is no question the two cases overlap, 
 
 
 
 
 
. The criminal protective order, therefore, 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page33 of 58

 
29 
compromises Ms. Maxwell’s ability to seek a stay of the unsealing process and 
thereby safeguard her right to a fair trial in the criminal case. 
The government can hardly dispute the merit of Ms. Maxwell’s argument 
for a stay. After all, the government itself moved to intervene and to stay all 
proceedings in Doe v. Indyke, a civil case in which Jane Doe alleges that Epstein and 
Ms. Maxwell abused and exploited her as a minor. ATTACHMENT B, p 4 (Doe v. 
Indyke et al., No. 20-cv-00484, ECF Dkt. 81, 9/14/2020 Order Granting Motion to 
Stay).6 According to the government, a stay of that case was necessary to 
“preserv[e] the integrity of the criminal prosecution against [Ms.] Maxwell.” Id. 
The court there agreed, and it granted Ms. Maxwell’s motion to stay. Id. at 12.7 
In contrast to Doe v. Indyke, the government has not moved to intervene in 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unsealing process, or to keep the deposition material 
and Ms. Maxwell’s depositions under seal. This makes no principled sense if the 
government’s opposition to modifying the criminal protective order is to be 
 
6 This Court can take judicial notice of this order. See Fed. R. Evid. 
201(c)(2). 
7 If a stay in Doe v. Indyke preserves the integrity of the criminal prosecution 
against Ms. Maxwell, Judge Nathan should have modified the criminal protective 
order so Judge Preska could have evaluated whether keeping the deposition 
material under seal would similarly “preserve the integrity of the criminal 
prosecution against Ms. Maxwell.” 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page34 of 58

 
30
believed. According to the government, 
 
 
 
 
But if that’s true, then the government should have moved to intervene 
before Judge Preska to oppose the unsealing of the deposition material, since, in the 
government’s view, that material is confidential. The (unprincipled) reason for the 
government’s decision not to intervene is obvious: If Ms. Maxwell’s depositions 
are released to the public, the government will argue to Judge Nathan that any 
violation of Martindell was harmless.  
It’s immaterial that the court stayed Doe v. Indyke during discovery while 
discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell finished in 2017. As this Court recognized in Louis 
Vuitton, “if civil defendants do not elect to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege, 
and instead fully cooperate with discovery, their ‘testimony . . . in their defense in 
the civil action is likely to constitute admissions of criminal conduct in their 
criminal prosecution.’” 676 F.3d at 98 (quoting SEC v. Boock, No. 09 Civ. 
8261(DLC), 2010 WL 2398918, at *2, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59498, at *5 
(S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2010) (alteration in original)).

31 
In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell elected not to invoke her Fifth 
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in reliance on the civil protective 
order and this Court’s decision in Martindell, which guarantees, at the very least, 
notice and an opportunity to be heard on a government motion to modify a civil 
protective order to obtain a deposition transcript. Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294; App. 
368–69. 
 
 This Court should permit 
Ms. Maxwell to tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge Preska decide 
whether the information weighs against unsealing the deposition material or in 
favor of a stay. 
The government insists otherwise, arguing that modification of the criminal 
protective order would comprise the secrecy of its ongoing grand jury investigation. 
App. 92. This contention is implausible on its face because Ms. Maxwell’s 
proposed modification of the criminal protective order doesn’t threaten to 
compromise the secrecy of anything. All Ms. Maxwell seeks is permission to share 
information with Judge Preska under seal. 
 
 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page36 of 58

32
Finally,
And it shows that Judge Preska erred failing even to acknowledge or address Ms.
Maxwell’s reliance argument. Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413, OB, p 24. Ms.
Maxwell declined to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination during her two depositions. She made that decision relying on the
civil protective order and this Court’s decision in Martindell, which holds that
absent a showing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c)
protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling
need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely
upon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties,
including the Government, and that such an order should not be
vacated or modified merely to accommodate the Government’s desire
to inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal
investigation, either as evidence or as the subject of a possible perjury
charge.
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page37 of 58

 
33 
Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. But unless Judge Nathan’s order is reversed in the 
criminal case, Ms. Maxwell cannot share this information with Judge Preska in the 
civil case.8  
Conclusion 
In the end, the government’s argument amounts to little more than this: 
Judge Preska should remain in the dark. But there’s no principled justification for 
that position, and this Court should reject it. 
This Court should reverse the district court’s order denying Ms. Maxwell’s 
motion to modify the protective order.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v–
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN)
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed letter motion seeking 
an Order modifying the protective order in this case.1  Specifically, she sought a Court order 
allowing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that 
she received in discovery from the Government in this case.  She also sought permission to 
1 This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.  
The Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion that the Government proposed on 
August 21, 2020, and it will enter that version into the public docket.  The Court’s decision to adopt the 
Government’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the 
documents in question are “judicial documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to 
the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access.  Id. at 119-20.  “Such 
countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’ 
and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 
1048 (2d Cir.1995) (“Amodeo II”)).  The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test.  First, the Court finds 
that the defendant’s letter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test.  United 
States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).  Second, the Court assumes that the common law 
presumption of access attaches, thereby satisfying the second element.  But in balancing competing considerations 
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including, 
most notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury 
investigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrowly tailored redactions.   
In light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to 
the Defendant’s reply letter, dated August 24, 2020 and the Defendant’s August 24, 2020 letter addressing her 
proposed redactions to the Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion.  The parties are further ORDERED to submit 
their proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions, 
they shall submit a joint letter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.

reference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.  For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.   
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), a Court may enter a protective order 
only after it finds that good cause exists.  Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing 
protective order is warranted.2  To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant 
factors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has 
sufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant matter.   
On July 30, 2020, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined 
that good cause existed.  Dkt. No. 36.  The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.  
See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating 
to the proposed protective order.”).  The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a 
provision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and 
not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.”  Dkt. No. 29, 
Ex. A ¶ 1(a).  That language was included in the Court’s July 30, 2020 protective order.  See Dkt. 
No. 36 ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a).  Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery. 
Upon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which 
seeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal 
 
2 In the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.”  In re Teligent, 
Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for 
modification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context.  See, e.g., United States v. Calderon, 
No. 3:15-CR-25 (JCH), 2017 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017) (applying the civil standard for the 
modification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. 07-CR-1027 (LAP), 2014 WL 
12710346 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (same).  See also United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (applying the standard for “good cause” in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective 
order entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 2007) (same).

case in other civil proceedings.  She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the 
Documents to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of issues being litigated in those civil matters.  But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated 
rhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to 
why that is the case.  She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to 
make before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in 
this criminal matter under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.  And she 
furnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be 
made in those matters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order 
to allow such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those matters.  In sum, the 
arguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause.  The 
Defendant’s request is DENIED on this basis. 
Indeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further 
lacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the 
judicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the 
Government’s docketed letter on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  In the opening paragraph of her 
reply letter dated August 24, 2020, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose 
under seal to certain judicial officers the following factual information:  
1.  Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government 
opened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-
conspirators;  
2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand 
jury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;

Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page43 of 58

 
4 
3. In February 2019, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of 
those civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury 
subpoenas;  
4. In April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) permitted the modification and, subsequently, 
another court (“Court-2”) did not;  
5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-1, the 
Recipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by 
the protective order; and  
6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of 
Rule 16 discovery in this criminal matter.   
With the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil 
matters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the letter 
filed on the public docket by the Government on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  Although this 
Court remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that 
those courts can make their own determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by 
the protective order in this matter, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the 
relevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the 
relevant judicial decision makers and civil matters. 
In addition, the Government has indicated that “there is no impediment to counsel 
making sealed applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant 
materials.”  Dkt. No. 46 at 3 n.5.  In her reply, the Defendant asserts that she is amenable to such 
a solution if the Court agrees with the Government that doing so would not contravene the 
protective order in this case.  To the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by the protective

order in this matter, the Defendant may make unsealing applications to those Courts if she 
wishes.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against-
DARREN K. INDYKE, et al., 
Defendants. 
20cv00484 (JGK) (DF) 
MEMORANDUM 
AND ORDER  
DEBRA FREEMAN, United States Magistrate Judge: 
This civil action, in which plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) has sued defendants 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as executors of the estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Epstein”) (the “Co-Executors”), as well as defendant Ghislaine Maxwell 
(“Maxwell”), individually (collectively, “Defendants”), for alleged sexual abuse and exploitation 
when Plaintiff was a minor, has been referred to this Court by the Honorable John G. Koeltl, 
U.S.D.J., for general pretrial supervision.  Currently before this Court is a letter motion filed by 
defendant Maxwell, seeking a stay of these proceedings pending the resolution of the criminal 
proceedings against her.  (Letter to the Court from Laura A. Menninger, Esq., dated Aug. 19, 
2020 (“8/19/20 Menninger Ltr.”) (Dkt. 69).)  For the reasons discussed below, Maxwell’s motion 
for a stay is granted, and these proceedings shall be stayed in their entirety, pending further order 
of the Court. 
BACKGROUND 
Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury in this District, and she is now being held in 
custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) as she awaits her criminal trial, which is 
set to begin on July 12, 2021, before the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, U.S.D.J.  (See id., at 2; see 
generally United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 20cr330 (AJN) (S.D.N.Y.).)  On August 19,

2020, Maxwell filed the letter motion that is now before this Court, requesting a stay of this 
action until the conclusion of her pending criminal case.  (See 8/19/20 Menninger Ltr.)  In her 
motion, Maxwell set out the factors relevant to a stay analysis, and argued that not only her own 
interest, but also the interests of the courts, the public, and the other parties would be best served 
by the requested stay.  (See generally id.)   
On August 27, 2020, the Co-Executors submitted a letter consenting to the entry of a stay 
and joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding.  (See Letter to the 
Court from Bennet J. Moskowitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2020 (“8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr.”) 
(Dkt. 77).)  The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay 
of this case (i.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiff’s claims against Maxwell), as a 
partial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff’s claims 
and would add unnecessary cost to the litigation.  (See id., at 1-2.)  The Co-Executors also 
pointed out that, if this matter were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of 
her claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program”) 
that has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases 
before the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits.  (See id., at 2-3.)    
By letter dated August 27, 2020, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing 
that the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief.  (See generally Letter to the 
Court from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2020 (“8/27/20 Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)  
In her opposition, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s detention should pose no real 
impediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a 
stay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to 
gain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without

having to divulge anything about herself or the bad conduct she is alleged to have committed.” 
(Id., at 1; see also id., at 4-5 (arguing that Maxwell had already demonstrated her ability to 
participate actively in this action from jail).)  Plaintiff also noted that, under the terms of the 
Compensation Program, she is not required to agree to a stay of her lawsuit in order to participate 
in that program.  (Id., at 2.)  As for the prejudice that Plaintiff would purportedly suffer from a 
stay of these proceedings, Plaintiff asserted that, “[f]or too long[,] Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell skirted the consequences of their vile acts,” and that she should not have to 
wait “even longer for justice.”  (Id., at 4.)  
Maxwell filed a reply on September 4, 2020 (see Letter to the Court from Laura A. 
Menninger, Esq., dated Sept. 4, 2020 (“9/4/20 Menninger Reply Ltr.”) (Dkt. 79)), contending 
that Plaintiff had not adequately demonstrated how the requested stay would harm her interests, 
and taking issue with Plaintiff’s assertions that Maxwell could reasonably litigate this case from 
the MDC (see id.).   
On September 4, 2020, this Court additionally received a letter from Acting United States 
Attorney Audrey Strauss, on behalf of the Government, requesting leave to intervene in this 
matter for the limited purpose of – like Maxwell – seeking a stay of this case, in its entirety, 
pending the resolution of the Government’s criminal prosecution against Maxwell.  (See Letter to 
the Court from Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney, by Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, 
and Lara Pomerantz, Assistant United States Attorneys, dated Sept. 4, 2020 (“9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr.”) 
(Dkt. 80).)  In its letter, the Government urged this Court to stay this action on the grounds that 
“a complete stay of this civil action [would] serve the public interest of preserving the integrity 
of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell and [would] conserve private, public, and judicial 
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 3 of 13
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page48 of 58

resources; and that those interests [would] outweigh any delay or disruption caused to the 
resolution of this civil action.”  (Id., at 1.) 
DISCUSSION 
I. 
THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST FOR INTERVENTION 
The Government is not a party to this civil action against Maxwell, and therefore does not 
have standing to move for a stay of this action.  Thus, for the limited purpose of seeking a stay, 
the Government has sought leave to intervene in the action.  (See 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr., at 1.)  This 
Court finds it unnecessary, however, to deal with the Government’s letter in an “intervention” 
framework, which would require an inquiry as to whether the Government meets the standards 
set out in Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rather, given that a motion for a stay 
has already been made by Maxwell, this Court finds it appropriate, in connection with that 
motion and in the exercise of its discretion, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an 
amicus curiae.  See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 288 (2010) 
(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative to 
intervention.”); Washington State Inv. Bd. v. Odebrecht S.A., No. 17cv8118 (PGG), 2018 WL 
6253877, at *10 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2018) (considering company’s submission contesting 
alternative service on chief executive officer as amicus filing); In GLG Life Tech Corp. Sec. 
Litig., 287 F.R.D. 262, 265 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (same); see also Brenner v. Scott, 298 F.R.D. 689 
(N.D. Fla. 2014) (not allowing organization that opposed same-sex marriage to intervene in 
Plaintiffs’ actions challenging Florida’s constitutional and statutory provisions banning same-sex 
marriage, but allowing the organization to be heard as amicus).  On this basis, this Court has 
fully considered the views expressed by the Government in its letter.

II. 
MAXWELL’S MOTION FOR A STAY 
A. 
Applicable Legal Standards 
Although staying a civil action pending the completion of a criminal prosecution against 
a named defendant has been characterized as an “extraordinary remedy,” Louis Vuitton Malletier 
S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012), “courts will not hesitate to grant a stay 
‘when the interests of justice seem to require’ it,” Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. LaGuardia, 
435 F. Supp. 3d 616, 621 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citing In re Worldcom, Inc. Securities Litigation, 
No. 02cv3288 (DLC), 2002 WL 31729501, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2002)) (granting a stay where 
there was overlap of issues in the civil and criminal cases and explaining that overlap of issues is 
a particularly significant factor); see also Trustees of Plumbers & Pipefitters Nat. Pension 
Fund v. Transworld Mech., Inc., 886 F. Supp. 1134 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (same); Volmar Distributors, 
Inc. v. New York Post Co., 152 F.R.D. 36, 42 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (staying civil discovery pending 
completion of the criminal case against the defendant); Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Shkreli, 
No. 15-CV-7175 (KAM) (RML), 2016 WL 1122029, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2016) (same).    
Ultimately, the decision as to whether to issue such a stay rests in the discretion of the 
district court, Louis Vuitton Malletier, 676 F.3d at 99, and each case requires a particularized 
inquiry, see id., at 98.  In determining whether a civil action should be stayed in the face of a 
parallel criminal proceeding, courts in this District have generally been guided by six factors:  
(1) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil 
case; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; 
(3) the private interests of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice 
to the plaintiff caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant; 
(5) the interests of the court(s); and (6) the public interest.  See id.; see also, e.g., Trustees of 
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 5 of 13

Plumbers and Pipefitters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at 1139.  The party seeking the stay 
“bears the burden of establishing its need,” Louis Vuitton Malletier, 676 F.3d at 97 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted), and this burden may be met where, on balance, the 
relevant factors suggest that proceeding with the civil action will likely result in undue prejudice 
to the defendant, see id. (noting that “absent a showing of undue prejudice . . . there is no reason 
why [a] plaintiff should be delayed in its efforts to diligently proceed to sustain its claim” 
(internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted)). 
B. 
The Relevant Factors Weigh in Favor of Granting a Stay of This Action. 
In this instance, as discussed below, the relevant factors support Maxell’s application for 
a stay. 
1. 
Overlap Between the Civil and Criminal Cases 
“The strongest case for granting a stay is where a party under criminal indictment is 
required to defend a civil proceeding involving the same matter.”  Volmar Distributors, 152 
F.R.D. at 39 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); accord In re Worldcom, 2002 WL 31729501, 
at *5.  Denying a stay where there is significant factual overlap between the civil and criminal 
cases may “undermine a defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . . . 
expand the rights of criminal discovery beyond the limits of Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution in advance of trial, or 
otherwise prejudice the case.”  Volmar Distributors, 152 F.R.D. at 39 (citations omitted); see also 
Johnson v. New York City Police Dep’t, No. 01cv6570 (RCC) (JCF), 2003 WL 21664882, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2003).   
As a threshold matter, this Court finds that, in this instance, there is significant factual 
overlap between this civil case and the pending criminal case.  For example, as Maxwell points 
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 6 of 13
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page51 of 58

7 
 
out, both the Indictment in the criminal case and the Complaint in this action contain allegations 
that Maxwell “groomed” minor victims by taking them to the movies or shopping, that Epstein 
paid for victims’ education, and that Maxwell facilitated Epstein’s abusive conduct.  (See 8/19/20 
Menninger Ltr., at 3 (summarizing certain allegations made in both actions and noting that 
particular allegations in the Indictment “are very similar in time frame and content to those in the 
Complaint”).)  The Government, in its submission, has confirmed that the allegations pleaded in 
this case will necessarily “touch on matters relating to the pending Indictment” (9/4/20 Gov’t 
Ltr., at 2), and has also noted that “given the factual overlap between the civil and criminal cases, 
allowing the criminal matter to be resolved in the first instance may result in a narrowing of the 
factual and legal issues before this Court” (id., at 3).  Plaintiff, in her opposition, does not contest 
that there is substantial overlap between the cases, in terms of the people involved, the relevant 
evidence, or the facts sought to be established.  (See generally 8/27/20 Glassman Ltr.)  Thus, this 
factor weighs in favor of granting a stay.  
2. 
Status of the Criminal Case 
The arguments favoring a stay are also stronger where the criminal case is not merely 
hypothetical or anticipated, but rather is actively proceeding.  In fact, as Maxwell notes, 
“‘[w]hether the defendant has been indicted has been described as “the most important factor” to 
be considered in the balance of factors.’”  (8/19/20 Menninger Ltr., at 4 (quoting Maldanado v. 
City of New York, No. 17cv6618 (AJN), 2018 WL 2561026, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2018)); see 
also In re Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sec. Litig., 133 F.R.D. 12, 13-14 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (noting 
that “[t]he weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a civil proceeding 
when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment” (collecting cases).)   
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 7 of 13
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page52 of 58

Here, Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury on June 29, 2020; she has been detained 
pending her criminal trial; and her trial date has been set.  (8/19/20 Menninger Ltr., at 2.)  Should 
discovery in the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend 
herself by making pretrial disclosures and giving deposition testimony (which could be used 
against her in the criminal case) or to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination (which would protect her in the criminal case, but which could well result in an 
adverse inference being drawn against her in the civil case).  (See id., at 4; see also Louis Vuitton 
Malletier, 676 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment privilege that may 
be posed by parallel proceedings).)   This legitimate concern, made more real and immediate by 
the active posture of criminal case, militates in favor of a stay.  
3. 
The Interests of the Plaintiff 
Plaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding would harm her interests because, as she is 
suffering “ongoing damaging effects” from the alleged abuse, and she should not have to wait 
any longer to hold Defendants accountable.  (8/27/20 Glassman Ltr., at 4.)  While, as a general 
matter, plaintiffs have a strong interest in the expeditious resolution of their civil claims, see 
Volmar Distributors, 152 F.R.D. at 40, Plaintiff here has not advanced any particularized reason 
why a delay would cause her prejudice, such as a likely loss of physical evidence or witness 
testimony during the period of a stay.  (See 8/19/20 Menninger Ltr., at 1 (noting that “there is 
little chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this 
case”); see also id., at 4.)   
Additionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to 
agree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the Compensation Program (and, in fact, 
recognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff 
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 8 of 13
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page53 of 58

9 
 
in her ability to seek redress for the sexual assaults and other tortious conduct on which her 
claims are based, as, during the pendency of any stay, she would still be able to participate in that 
program.   
Overall, and despite Plaintiff’s assertion that a stay would work to her disadvantage, this 
Court finds that any generalized prejudice that she would suffer as the result of a stay is not 
sufficient to counterbalance the other factors that the Court should consider, which all heavily 
favor a stay.  
4. 
The Interests of the Defendant 
The private interests of Maxwell, and the burden that she would face in proceeding with 
discovery in the civil action at this time are significant.  As already noted, if civil discovery were 
to proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth 
Amendment privilege – a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of 
the cases she is defending.  See Louis Vuitton, 676 F.3d at 97.  Also, due to heightened 
restrictions at the MDC during the COVID-19 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes 
judicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to 
have difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to 
confer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case.  (See 8/19/20 Menninger Ltr., 
at 5; see also 9/4/20 Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)    
This Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell, 
but also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current detention, would 
necessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the discovery process in this action, 
and would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.

Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page54 of 58

10 
 
5. 
The Interests of the Court 
As for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could 
conserve judicial resources.  Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil 
case, this factor supports a stay.  Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Abraaj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. 19cv3244 
(AJN), 2019 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2019).  As observed by the Government, the 
pending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions, 
and may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this 
case.  (See 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr., at 2.)   
Further, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has 
some interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have 
been brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are 
currently going forward.  This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may 
be imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil 
case were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to 
information in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise 
discovery here.  (See 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information 
about the criminal matter is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has 
entered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that 
Maxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information”); see 
also 8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures, 
that, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited 
from disclosing certain information in the civil case).)   
Thus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay. 
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 10 of 13
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page55 of 58

11 
 
6. 
The Public Interest   
 
Plaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allowing her claims to proceed.  
(8/27/20 Glassman Ltr., at 5.)  Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil 
litigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a 
wrongdoer.  (Id.)  Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently 
being litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation 
of this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant 
Maxwell’s well known criminal enterprise, how it was operated and all those involved.”  (Id.)  It 
is a mischaracterization of this action, however, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for 
addressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell 
has been stayed, it has not been terminated – just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.  
Moreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity 
of criminal proceedings.  (See generally 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr.)  Should civil discovery proceed, there 
is a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature disclosure of the 
testimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced.  (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson, 
2003 WL 21664882, at *2).)  On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of 
granting a stay.  
 
Accordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell 
has met her burden to show that a stay of this action is warranted. 
C. 
The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety. 
The Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant 
Maxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety.  Indeed, the 
Co-Executors take pains to argue that a partial stay as to only Plaintiff’s claims against Maxwell 
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF   Document 81   Filed 09/14/20   Page 11 of 13
Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page56 of 58

12 
 
would unduly prejudice their ability to mount their own defense.  (See 8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr., 
at 1-2.)  Where one defendant is a central figure in an action, and where that individual’s 
testimony is of key importance, a partial stay can lead to duplicative discovery efforts.  Trustees 
of Plumbers and Pipefitters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at 1141.  This Court is persuaded 
that, as Maxwell is a central figure in this civil case, a stay of discovery that applies only to her 
would prejudice the Co-Executors by requiring them to conduct discovery without having the 
opportunity to depose Maxwell or collect documents in her possession.  (See 8/27/20 Moskowitz 
Ltr., at 1-2.)  Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay 
is lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may 
have already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is 
obtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses.  (See id. at 2.)   
CONCLUSION 
For all of the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s motion for a stay of this action, in its entirety, 
pending the completion of the criminal prosecution against her (Dkt. 69) is granted.  If, however, 
the underlying circumstances change over time in a way that could affect this Court’s balancing 
of the relevant factors, then the parties may bring the changed circumstances to this Court’s 
attention, and it will then consider whether the stay should continue or be lifted.  Absent any 
further application to this Court to review the stay, the parties are directed to provide this Court

with a joint status report in no more than 90 days, and every 90 days thereafter, during the 
pendency of the stay.

7 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all purposes. In
its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested that the Court
schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this matter in the afternoon
of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID public health crisis, there are
significant safety issues related to in-court proceedings. If the Defendant is willing to
waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be conducted remotely. To that end,
defense counsel should confer with the Defendant regarding waiving her physical
presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her physical presence for this proceeding, she
and her counsel should sign the attached form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If
this proceeding is to be conducted remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan
Detention Center that limit the times at which the Defendant could be produced so that she
could appear by video. In the next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at
either 9:00 a.m. on July 9, 2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel
are hereby ordered to meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in
light of these constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m.
tonight, counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for the
Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

10 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in
this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an internet
platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers will email
counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To optimize the
quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, and counsel for
the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access the audio
of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet platform
system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of the
press, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in
number, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order.
Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding
will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick
Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing
requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional
persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone
who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature
taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, attached. Completing
the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who
meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are
below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the
nose and mouth must be worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-
19 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.
There are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,
if possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the
Defendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able
to sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of
March 27, 2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least
24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an
inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court
to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the
Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and
accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The Court
will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate
logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email
within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on
the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and
July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in
transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F). And the
Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July 14, 2020.
Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds
"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public
and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also
supported by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, which will
facilitate the timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of third

16 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will hold
an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in the
United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling 855-268-7844
and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of the United States
may access the live audio feed by calling 214-416-0400 and using the same access code
and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately 500 callers on a first come,
first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both sides an additional dial-in
number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding for non-speaking co-counsel,
alleged victims, and any family members of the Defendant. The United States Attorney's
Office should email Chambers with information regarding any alleged victims who are
entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to
be heard. The Court will then provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in
access. As the Court described in a previous order, members of the press and public may
watch and listen to the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick
Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID-19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government may
contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims or family
members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in-house press corps may contact
the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating will be allocated on a

first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse
Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020. See Dkt. No. 10. If
conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing for in-person viewing of
the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public health, the Court may provide
audio access by telephone only. Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of
federal court proceedings is prohibited by law. Violation of these prohibitions may result in
fines or sanctions, including removal of court issued media credentials, restricted entry to
future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary
by the Court. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/9/2020)(jbo)

28 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting the
Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial statements
concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that counsel for all
involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this Court's local rules,
including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional responsibility. In light of
this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further action is needed at this time
to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the
Defendant's motion without prejudice. But the Court warns counsel and agents for the
parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to take
appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure
strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial
will be safeguarded. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/23/2020) (ap) (Entered:

36 PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be followed
that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
37 MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,
two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allowing her to
publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to
the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.
Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their
counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the
criminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of
these issues. For the following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed
protective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the
court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other
appropriate relief." The good cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests,
including whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...
whether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the
public's interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good
cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). First, the
Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with regard to
restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses
other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general
matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy
of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their
identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the protective order should
"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing
or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the
discovery materials"); see also United States v. Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 194426, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is
significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.
Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.
But not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or
contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply
making a public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since
such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allows
the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to
Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and
preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, 5. This proposal adequately
balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,
to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific
investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.
Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery
materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The
request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile

criminal matters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many
restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy
Act of 1974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office
for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to
scrupulously follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide
potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.
See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be
subject to examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them
by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing reasons,
the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be entered on the
docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant.

X 
COUNT ONE 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
Sl 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. 
In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. 
The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to

App.014
Case 20-3061, Document 61, 09/24/2020, 2938280, Page16 of 125
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. 
Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. 
In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. 
Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image:

4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts w,ith Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. 
MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. 
Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. 
For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would

massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. 
In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. 
Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. 
As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. 
In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. 
Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. 
Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals,

MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. 
Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a.

Opper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following

d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. 
In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. 
MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. 
During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. 
First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. 
MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. 
Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. 
MAXWELL was present for

App.020
Case 20-3061, Document 61, 09/24/2020, 2938280, Page22 of 125
and involved in some of this abuse. 
In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. 
Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. 
As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. 
Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. 
Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. 
MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. 
While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. 
MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. 
In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing

an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. 
MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. 
Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. 
MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. 
During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. 
Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

Re:    United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 20 Cr. 330 (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.1 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an 
order prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial 
statements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government, 
its agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial 
to a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the 
right to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right 
to a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on 
evidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the 
accused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial 
publicity.” Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (1979).  This District has given effect 
to this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.1.  Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell 
requests that the Court exercise its express power under Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h) and enter 
an Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial 
pretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses. 
Legal Standard 
More than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the 
Supreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect 
their processes from prejudicial outside interferences.  Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense, 
the accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the 
court should be permitted to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363 
(1966) (emphasis added).

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

In an effort to protect the trial process from “prejudicial outside interferences,” this Court 
promulgated Local Criminal Rule 23.1(a) which provides, in relevant part, that:  
It is the duty of the lawyer or law firm, … and government agents 
and police officers, not to release or authorize the release of non-
public information or opinion which a reasonable person would 
expect to be disseminated by means of public communication, in 
connection with pending or imminent criminal litigation with 
which they are associated, if there is a substantial likelihood that 
such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise 
prejudice the due administration of justice. 
To avoid any confusion this Court identified seven “subject matters” that “presumptively 
involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or 
otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” Id. at (d). Accordingly, lawyers for parties 
and witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information 
concerning: 
(1) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or 
the character or reputation of the accused…; 
(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the 
accused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement; 
(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to 
submit to an examination or test;  
(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer 
or law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise 
prohibited by law;  
(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;  
(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knows is likely to be inadmissible at trial and 
would if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and  
(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or 
the evidence in the case.  
Id. at (d)(1-7) (emphasis added).

Recent Prejudicial Public Statements by the Government, its Agents and Counsel to 
Prospective Witnesses 
 
Recent public statements by the Government, its agents and counsel for prospective 
witnesses have included presumptively prejudicial information.  
On July 2, 2020 Ms. Maxwell was arrested without notice to her lawyers who had been in 
active communication with the Government for one year.  Because plain vanilla surrenders lack 
the fanfare and attendant media coverage afforded to secret, armed, raids at dawn, the 
Government chose to invade Ms. Maxwell’s New Hampshire residence, arrest her, and stage a 
media presentation that included numerous statements that prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s right to a 
fair trial. 
Immediately following Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss held 
a press conference in which she commented on Ms. Maxwell’s credibility and her incorrect 
opinions concerning “guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the 
case” in violation of Local Rule 23.1(d)(1), (4) and (7):  
Per the New York Law Journal: 
‘Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,’ Strauss said 
at a press conference announcing the charges. ‘Maxwell enticed minor girls, got 
them to trust her and then delivered them into the trap that that she and Epstein 
had set for them. She pretended to be a woman they could trust, all the while she 
was setting them up to be sexually abused by Epstein and, in some cases, by 
Maxwell herself.’1 
As reported in the Washington Post,  
Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the socialite told that lie and 
others in deposition because the truth ‘was almost unspeakable.’  
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss called the sex abuse described in the 
Maxwell case ‘the prequel’ to the charges they lodged against Epstein…. 
Maxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend, and groom 
minor victims for abuse’ … ‘In some cases Maxwell participated in the abuse 
itself.’2

Although Ms. Strauss sprinkled her comments with the phrase “as alleged,” she presented 
certain of her statements as fact.3  Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent 
William Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this 
investigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New 
Hampshire.”  Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about 
character and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake 
slithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no 
compelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this 
District. 
New York attorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several 
witnesses in this matter, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in 
recent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.1, which 
applies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically. 
See Rule 23.1(a) and (b). 
As reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited 
subject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in 
violation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:  
Boies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as 
she looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence. 
Maxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with 
other wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with 
underaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public 
stature who were involved with Epstein.’4 
Ms. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go 
away but today is a step toward healing.” Id. 
Bradley Edwards, another attorney representing witnesses in this matter made similar 
presumptively prejudicial statements following Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:5 
‘The reality of how this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was 
orchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.  So to the degree 
that um there was a main facilitator that started the whole thing, it was Ghislaine.

So to cooperate in the way that that kind of rumors out there would mean that 
she’s cooperating downwards.  She’d be cooperating with people who are much 
less culpable than her.  Will she name names to try to shave years off of what 
would be a lengthy prison sentence maybe, I think you should probably expect 
that if she’s going to share information that’s going to actually help her, it’s 
probably gonna be about unrelated crimes that she may be aware about because 
with respect to this particular operation, in terms of living people, she’s as high as 
it gets. … I think like most of my clients would really hope that she does 
cooperate, at least shares the information that she has.  I mean I know that it 
would only be to help herself but the public deserves to know who was involved 
besides her and Jeffrey Epstein, and only she knows that. 
The violations of Rule 23.1 did not stop after Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and detention. 
Following the detention hearing on July 14, 2020, Mr. Boies, counsel for one of the accusers 
who spoke at the hearing, commented on the content of the hearing.  As reported by Bloomberg, 
Mr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms. 
Maxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all 
in violation of subsections (1), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule: 
That’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who 
represents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused 
by Epstein and Maxwell. … It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her 
credibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.  
‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying 
to blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so 
contrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just 
going to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were 
representing her.’  
Boies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if 
there’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not 
to grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused 
me.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies 
said that Farmer was a 16-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met 
Maxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group 
of high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said. 
‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are 
fraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.’6

Mr. Boies and Ms. McCawley gave on-air interviews with ABC News following Ms. 
Maxwell’s detention that contained repeated, presumptively prejudicial quotes, including: 7   
Boies: Remember these girls were abused twice, once sexually years ago and then 
a second time when Epstein and Maxwell and all their enablers began these 
vicious attacks on their credibility. … No question about it.  Maxwell knows 
where a lot of the bodies are buried.  If I was somebody who had participated in 
their sex trafficking, um, I would not be sleeping easily tonight. 
Boies:  I think that [the accusers] want to see her go to trial.  On the other hand, 
the arrest and conviction that would come from a plea deal is an enormous step 
and I think they also recognize that Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell did not act alone.  
There are lots of other people that need to be brought to justice. 
McCawley: I think that the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have 
done an incredible job and they’re being very meticulous, they want to make sure 
that the Indictments stick.  …They took a lot of time to be very careful and 
thoughtful and that gives me a lot of hope that she will remain in prison for the 
remainder of her life.  … This morning was a very joyful and tearful filled 
morning, it was a wonderful moment in my journey with these survivors, to be 
able to call them and tell them that the one person’s who’s been out in the public 
without being held accountable was finally in prison….She was really, Ghislaine 
was really the central figure, so she worked hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein to 
be able to facilitate these crimes over the course of more than two decades; and 
she was the  main person who assisted him and allowed him to be able to 
perpetrate so many crimes against young females. 
These comments violate subsections (6) and (7) of the Rule. 
 
It appears that given any opportunity lawyers associated with the prosecution of this case 
will offer any opinion that damages Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity for a fair trial. Entry of an order 
prohibiting extrajudicial statements, therefore, is a necessary remedy to avoid further 
dissemination of prejudicial information.  The Court, under Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h) should 
enter an Order, punishable by contempt, that all lawyers associated with this case, and their 
agents, comply with the Rule and refrain from publicly commenting on the seven prohibited 
topics identified in subsection (d).

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v–
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN)
ORDER
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Defense has moved for an order “prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel 
for witnesses from making extrajudicial statements concerning this case.”  Dkt. No. 27 at 1.   
The Court firmly expects that counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to 
ensure compliance with this Court’s local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the 
rules of professional responsibility.  In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe 
that further action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant’s right to a fair trial by an 
impartial jury.  Accordingly, it denies the Defendant’s motion without prejudice.  But the Court 
warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it 
will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules.  The 
Court will ensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant’s right to 
a fair trial will be safeguarded.   
SO ORDERED. 
Dated: July 23, 2020

Re:  United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)  
Dear Judge Nathan: 
On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a 
protective order in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.   
The government has indicated that it requires the entry of a protective order before 
producing any discovery material to Ms. Maxwell.  On July 9, 2020, the government provided 
defense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order.  Since that time, the parties 
have conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach 
agreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order. 
Two key disputes remain, however, which require the Court’s guidance.  First, the 
defense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the 
same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely, 
if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not 
use those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may 
not post those materials on the Internet.  Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted 
from publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential 
witnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by 
speaking on the public record.   
As set forth below, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate 
restrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals

referenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring 
that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.   
Legal Standard 
Where the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule 16(d)(l) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “show good cause for the issuance of a 
protective order.”  United States v. Annabi, No. 10 Cr. 7 (CM), 2010 WL 1253221, at *1 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2010).  To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a 
protective order, the government must show that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and 
serious injury.”  United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3d Cir. 2007).  A finding of harm 
“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory 
statements.”  United States v. Gangi, 1998 WL 226196, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 1998) (citations 
and internal quotations omitted).  “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific 
examples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause showing.”  Wecht, 484 F.3d at 
211. 
Courts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary” 
to accomplish its goals.  United States v. Lindh, 198 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2002) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the 
impact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to 
prepare and present a full defense at trial.”  Id. 
Discussion 
1. 
Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials 
The government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a 
restriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for 
any civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action; 
or (ii) posting discovery materials on the Internet.  See Ex. A ¶¶ 1(a), 5.  The defense’s proposed 
protective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government 
witnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense.  See Ex. A ¶¶ 3, 5.  
The government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknowledging 
that it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial 
preparation.   
As the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and 
many of the government’s potential witnesses.  Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and 
their counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms. 
Maxwell’s arrest.  There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery 
materials to support their civil cases and future public statements.  It is therefore vital that the 
government’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.

Maxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this 
criminal case. 
2. 
Victim/Witness Identities 
Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and 
others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or 
potential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel 
from publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in 
public fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine 
Maxwell.”  Id. ¶ 6.  This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the 
language in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr. 
Epstein, see United States v. Epstein, 19-CR-00490-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2019), ensures 
appropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.  
In contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the 
government has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be allowed to 
disclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the 
public record “in this case.”  The government’s proposal, however, advances no compelling 
privacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who 
have already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil 
suits in their own name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public 
record in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or 
posting comments under their own names on social media.  The government’s proposed 
restriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these 
individuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to 
conduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s 
behalf.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter with respect to the protective order to be 
entered in the above-captioned case, and to respond to the defendant’s letter and submission of 
July 27, 2020 (the “Defendant Letter” or “Def. Ltr.”) (Dkt. 29).  The Government and defense 
counsel have conferred regarding a protective order several times via telephone and email between 
July 9, 2020, and today, including as recently as this morning.  The Government and defense 
counsel have come to an agreement on much of the proposed protective order.  However, the 
parties disagree as to two inclusions sought by the defendant which the Government objects to and 
for which, as detailed herein, the Government submits there is no legal basis.  Accordingly, the 
Government respectfully requests that the Court enter its proposed protective order (the 
“Government Proposed Order”), which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and which differs from the 
defendant’s proposed order in those two respects, as further described below. 
A. 
The Defendant’s Request to be Permitted to Publicly Name and Identify Victims 
As detailed herein, the Government seeks to protect the identities of victims, consistent 
with their significant privacy interests and the well-established law in this Circuit, and proposes a 
protective order consistent with those very significant interests.  In contrast, the defendant insists 
that the protective order be modified such that she and her counsel would be permitted to “publicly 
referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken on the public record to the media or in public 
fora, or in litigation – criminal or otherwise – relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” 1  
                                                 
1  Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that 
it adds a sentence, in its paragraph 6 (which is paragraph 5 of the Government Proposed Order), 
stating the following: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing 
individuals who have spoken on the record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation – criminal 
or otherwise – relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”  The defendant also either adds

The defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permitted to name any individuals who have 
ever publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public 
fora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate, 
and should be denied. 
As an initial matter, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and 
victim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect.  Particularly 
in the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim 
identities and other sensitive information.  Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 
3771, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded, 
among other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he 
right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.”  Id. §§ 
(a)(1), (a)(8) (emphasis added).  Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting 
the identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”  
United States v. Paris, 2007 WL 1484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May 18, 2007). 
Moreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely 
acknowledged the need to protect victim-witness identities.  See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 
13 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2016 WL 9022508, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016) (“Because Corley’s minor 
victims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal, 
the Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from 
learning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, 07 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2008 WL 
5068820, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 10, 2008) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government 
witnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity 
to protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment.  This Court agrees.  Thus, the parties 
[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity 
or any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”).  It is similarly routine in this 
District for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-1” or 
“Witness-1”) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly. 
The Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally 
requiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or 
filing while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.  
Indeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s 
proposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators, 
should not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with 
prospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing 
or disseminating any such identities.  See Government Proposed Order ¶ 5.  The terms of the 
Government’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by 
name in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of 
a pseudonym in public filings.  The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be 
prohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time 
                                                 
or deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense 
paragraphs 7, 9, and 17 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and 16).

speak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because 
those victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in 
connection with this case.  These proposals are reasonable, narrowly tailored, and not broader than 
necessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential 
harassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other 
adverse consequences.  At this stage in the case, permitting defense counsel to refer to witnesses 
by name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations 
during their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative 
choice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable 
the defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense. 
The defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and 
her counsel should be permitted to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken 
on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation – criminal or otherwise – relating 
to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”  In support of the defendant’s application for such 
sweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the 
conclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court 
proceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and 
advocate on the defendant’s behalf.  The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to 
explain how or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial, 
and the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the 
absurd.2 
The Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing.  As described above, 
the Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the 
identities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their 
counsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying 
information).  Government Proposed Order ¶ 5.  It would further permit the defendant to publicly 
identify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case.  Id. ¶ 6.  And it would 
permit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal.  See id. 
                                                 
2  Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested 
modification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be 
appropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained 
what defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and 
thus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and 
scrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them).  Beyond the offensive notion that victims of 
sexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their 
experience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should 
receive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.  
Permitting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on 
the record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no 
conceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating 
with the Government.

Moreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the 
protective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who 
have not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names 
from court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion.  As noted, to date, defense 
counsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so 
would be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might 
want to do so. 
The defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject 
matter limitation as to the phrase “public fora.”  Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean 
that any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell 
publicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel 
in connection with this case.  This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke 
to a journalist for a local story in 1997, or posted on a MySpace page followed by a handful of 
friends in 2005, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2009, or posted on Twitter to a handful 
of followers in 2013.  But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly 
be construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “to self-identify,” Def. Ltr. 
at 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public attention 
and scrutiny.   
Additionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without 
providing any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no 
limitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense 
statements or filings.  In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the 
public glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no 
matter how long ago or how brief—without that victim’s knowing consent and without any 
substantive justification.  That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make 
productions of discovery and 3500 materials well surpassing its obligations.  Those productions 
will necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call 
as witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case.  But 
the defendant’s proposal would allow her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public 
statement or filing at their sole discretion.  This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps 
or trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the 
Crime Victims’ Rights Act. 
Conversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not 
be precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this 
criminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed 
choice to be associated publicly with this case.  See Government Proposed Order ¶¶ 5, 6, 8.  The 
identity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and 
her counsel. 
The defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material 
respects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (Dkt. 38).  
Def. Ltr. at 3.  In the first instance, that is false.  The protective order in the Epstein case included

a provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals 
who had spoken on the public record in litigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein.  Id. ¶ 4.  Here, defense 
counsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims 
of either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader 
allowance.  Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would 
have been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every 
single one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.   
Additionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant 
differences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case.  First, at the time 
the Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified 
themselves by name in litigation.  Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was 
extremely limited.  Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was 
entered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about 
their victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their own terms and in their own 
ways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of 
the dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein following his suicide.  Those victims could 
not possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by 
defense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case.  Victims should be able to continue 
to come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal, 
shaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel 
in this case. 
In sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the 
defendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims.  Moreover, it is 
without basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the 
defendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to 
publicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other 
than a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.3  At bottom, the 
defendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no 
discernible reason, and without justification or legal basis.  The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and 
Jeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and 
common decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense 
proposal would afford. 
B. 
The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents 
The defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the 
Government in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently 
possesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the 
                                                 
3  To the extent defense counsel attempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first 
time in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or 
arguments.

Government.4  The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where 
such a restriction has been imposed in a protective order.  Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective 
order to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so 
that the Government may provide a defendant with discovery.  The defendant’s attempt to refuse 
to agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use 
of its own materials should be rejected.   
As an initial matter, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its 
investigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary 
disclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other policies of the Department of 
Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  In this case, 
consistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed 
defense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel 
with the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that.  Indeed, 
consistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a 
witness, with any material they did not already possess.  While the Government does more 
commonly show a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the 
Government rarely if ever shows a  witness material she has not already seen, does not have 
personal knowledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon.  Practically 
speaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not 
likely to occur. 
Nevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to 
demand restrictions on the Government’s use of its own materials.  To the contrary, as noted above, 
many of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes 
no suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case.  Moreover, the Government as 
a whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would 
conflict with such language in a protective order.  For example, the Government has obligations 
under various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of 
Information Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951), that cannot be bargained away through 
a protective order.  Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has 
received both FOIA and Touhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which 
the Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately.  The Government respectfully 
submits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a 
protective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations.  Tellingly, the defendant cites 
no authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue. 
By contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the 
Government, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use, 
                                                 
4  Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that 
it adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential 
witnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government 
paragraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.

of such materials provided by the defendant to the Government.  But there is no basis to add 
additional restrictions upon the Government’s use of materials gathered by the Government itself. 
The defendant’s only counter-argument, as noted—that this Court should put third parties 
“on equal footing with the defense”—is both unlikely to be relevant given the Government’s 
standard practice, as described above, and, the Government submits, an irrelevant consideration in 
the context of a criminal protective order.  Indeed, the Government respectfully submits that 
neither it nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate 
or permissible in civil cases. 
In sum, the defendant’s attempt to restrict the Government and to restrict third parties in 
this way appears to be unprecedented, and is without legal basis, and should be denied. 
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court should enter the Government’s 
proposed protective order, which is enclosed, and deny the defendant’s motion.

support personnel, and secretarial staff involved in the 
representation of the defendants in this case), all of whom are 
nonetheless bound by this Protective Order. 
3.

Defense Witnesses, via means other than electronic mail, Defense 
Counsel shall encrypt and/or password protect the Discovery.

disclosing or disseminating the identity of any victims or 
witnesses referenced in the Discovery.  This Order does not 
prohibit Defense Counsel or Defense Staff from referencing the 
identities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the 
defense to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during 
the course of the investigation and preparation of the defense 
case at trial.  Any Potential Defense Witnesses and their 
counsel who are provided identifying information by Defense 
Counsel or Defense Staff are prohibited from further disclosing 
or disseminating such identifying information.  This Order does

individuals who have spoken by name on the public record in this 
case. 
6. 
The Defendant, Defense Counsel, Defense Staff, 
Defense Experts/Advisors, Potential Defense Witnesses, and Other

7. 
Copies of Discovery or other materials produced 
by the Government in this action bearing “confidential” stamps, 
or designated as “confidential” as described below, and/or 
electronic Discovery materials designated as “confidential” by 
the Government, including such materials marked as 
“confidential” either on the documents or materials themselves, 
or designated as “confidential” in a folder or document title, 
are deemed “Confidential Information.”  The Government shall 
clearly mark all pages or electronic materials containing 
Confidential Information, or folder or document titles as 
necessary, with “confidential” designations. 
8. 
Confidential Information may contain personal 
identification information of victims, witnesses, or other 
specific individuals who are not parties to this action, and 
other confidential information; as well as information that

this matter.  The identity of an alleged victim or witness who 
has identified herself or himself publicly as such on the record 
in this case shall not be treated as Confidential Information. 
9. 
Defense Counsel may, at any time, notify the 
Government that Defense Counsel does not concur in the 
designation of documents or other materials as Confidential 
Information.  If the Government does not agree to de-designate

the Court for an Order de-designating such documents or 
materials.  The Government’s designation of such documents and 
materials as Confidential Information will be controlling absent 
contrary order of the Court.

Confidential Information disclosed to the 
defendant, or Defense Counsel, respectively, during the course 
of proceedings in this action: 
a) 
Shall be used by the Defendant or her

have read and signed this Order acknowledging that such 
individual(s) are bound by this Order. 
11. 
Copies of Discovery or other materials produced 
by the Government in this action bearing “highly confidential” 
stamps or otherwise specifically designated as “highly 
confidential,” and/or electronic Discovery materials designated 
as “highly confidential” by the Government, including such 
materials marked as “highly confidential” either on the 
documents or materials themselves, or designated as “highly 
confidential” in an index, folder title, or document title, are

themselves. 
12. 
Highly Confidential Information contains nude, 
partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other 
depictions of individuals. 
13. 
Defense Counsel may, at any time, notify the 
Government that Defense Counsel does not concur in the 
designation of documents or other materials as Highly 
Confidential Information.  If the Government does not agree to 
de-designate such documents or materials, Defense Counsel may 
thereafter move the Court for an Order de-designating such

Highly Confidential Information disclosed to 
Defense Counsel during the course of proceedings in this action:

Counsel from a source other than the Government. 
17. 
Except for Discovery that has been made part of

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v–
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN)
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Both parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order.  While they agree on 
most of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged.  First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language 
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public 
record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.  
Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their 
counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial 
in this action.  The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues.  For the 
following reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.   
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), “[a]t any time the court may, for 
good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”  
The good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether 
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of 
the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the 
information.”  United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  The party 
seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good cause.  Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche 
Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).

First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with 
regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and 
witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation.  As a 
general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the 
privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of 
their identities.  Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the protective order should 
“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or 
disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery 
materials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at 
*11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016).  The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for
individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because 
they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.  But not all accusations or public statements 
are equal.  Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a 
far different matter than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey 
Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no 
relevance to the charges in this case.  These individuals still maintain a significant privacy 
interest that must be safeguarded.  The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks 
undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by 
law.  In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly 
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.  It also allows the 
Defense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential 
Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the 
defense case at trial.”  Dkt. No. 33-1, ¶ 5.  This proposal adequately balances the interests at 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 37   Filed 07/30/20   Page 2 of 3
App.088
Case 20-3061, Document 61, 09/24/2020, 2938280, Page90 of 125

stake.  And as the Government’s letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense 
needs an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make 
applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.   
Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use 
discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted.  The 
request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal 
matters that had related civil litigation.  The Government labors under many restrictions 
including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and 
other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follow.  
Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with 
materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.  See Dkt. No. 33 at 6.  And of 
course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to 
what materials were provided or shown to them by the Government.  Nothing in the Defense’s 
papers explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a 
fair trial.  
For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order, 
which will be entered on the docket.   
This resolves Dkt. No. 29.   
SO ORDERED.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s letter of 
August 17, 2020 (the “Defense Letter”), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the 
defendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced 
by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other 
discovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases.  Those applications should 
be denied.1 
As an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce, 
substantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations.  Those include 
materials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative 
methods available only to the Government.  Indeed, the Government has already produced more 
than 165,000 pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense 
Letter.  Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated 
civil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated 
“Confidential” thereunder.  As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely 
appropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by 
the issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.  
                                                 
1 The Government has drafted this letter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed 
materials and grand jury information.  Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to 
seal or redact this submission.  Because the Defense Letter repeatedly references, and attaches as 
exhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if 
filed publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate letter, under seal, proposing redactions 
to the Defense Letter and requesting that the attachments to the Defense Letter be filed under seal.

In particular, the Defense Letter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating 
to applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other 
judicial proceedings.  By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit 
compliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”).  Those Subpoenas were issued 
to a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into 
Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators.  For obvious reasons and in keeping with its 
standard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued 
the Subpoenas.  In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government 
that it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance.  Accordingly, in 
or about February 2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to 
request modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.  
In or about April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) granted the Government’s application, and permitted 
that the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further 
dissemination—to the Recipient. 2   Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the 
Government’s application.  Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both 
Court-1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal, 
except that both have expressly permitted the Government to produce those filings to the defendant 
as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case.  The Defense Letter now seeks to use 
those discovery materials in the Civil Cases. 
At base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process 
of criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the 
criminal discovery process and civil litigation.  To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is 
to enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of 
materials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery.  Her motion is nothing more than an 
effort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago.  It 
should be denied for multiple reasons. 
First, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides 
that any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of 
designation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the 
defense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the 
defense of this action.”  Protective Order ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36).  Indeed, 
the defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her own proposed protective order. 
This was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed.  See 
Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order ¶ 1(a) (Dkt. 29-1).  Yet less than a month later, the 
defendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the 
                                                 
2 In the Defense Letter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the 
sealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the 
Government’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties.  The defendant’s 
suggestion is patently incorrect.  The relevant order was signed in April 2019 and was issued for 
the purpose of being provided to the Recipient.  Indeed the order contained an explicit provision 
that it could be transmitted to the Recipient.  Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient 
well over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.

Government in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably 
applies, to litigate her Civil Cases.  There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here. 
Second, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective 
order that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal 
discovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party.  To allow the 
defendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those 
that are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third 
parties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations.  Here, the Government was particularly 
concerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her 
counsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases.  It would be grossly 
inappropriate for defense counsel to be permitted to sift through the criminal case discovery and 
cherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend 
against accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-
sealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.  
And yet that is what the defendant proposes. 
Third, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an 
ongoing grand jury investigation.  Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain 
under seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those 
matters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Letter, remain sealed.3  As 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the 
investigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of 
Jeffrey Epstein remains active.  The full scope and details of that investigation, however, have not 
been made public.4  Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were 
produced under a “Confidential” designation.  Any argument that such materials are not 
“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also 
misapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.5  See, 
                                                 
3 The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (1) as noted above, the permission from Court-1 
to provide the April 2019 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions 
the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the 
record relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case.  The 
defendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without 
any application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect. 
4 To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the 
nature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental 
letter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an 
explanation. 
5 Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are 
improperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-1 and 
Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.  Presumably they have not done so because

e.g., United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“As a general proposition, 
courts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are 
presumptively accessible, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might ‘adversely affect 
law enforcement interests.’”) (citing United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050)); see also 
United States v. Park, 619 F. Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that the need to “maintain 
the secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain 
sentencing documents).   
Fourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal 
defendant should be permitted to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases.  Nor is the 
Government aware of any.  Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—
perhaps because few defendants attempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, 15 Cr. 
025, 2017 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017) (discussing the relative lack of specific 
guidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also 
United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 721 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[m]otions to modify protective 
orders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of 
blurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant attempts here.  See 
Calderon, 2017 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a 
criminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOIA suit); United States 
v. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2020 WL 1495880, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2020) (denying 
a defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of 
pursuing claims in a civil action, even following the completion of trial). 
Absent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion, 
makes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome.  In 
particular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the 
Government secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling 
the defendant.  That is how grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work.  Defense 
counsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the 
Government obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about 
the manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.   
Certainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has 
engaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to 
suggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to 
circumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.  
In any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access 
to is the lone April 2019 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil 
Cases at this stage is significantly overstated.  And to the extent the defendant may seek to make 
similar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government 
obtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently 
                                                 
they recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury 
investigation.

requested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously 
oppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.  
Finally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehow necessary 
to her ability to bring issues to the attention of other courts, the Defense Letter completely fails to 
explain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery 
materials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil 
Cases.  The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization 
for compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the 
Civil Cases.  To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that 
courts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the 
defendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in 
those cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of 
malfeasance.6 
In sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the 
relevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court 
to permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate 
a civil case.  Accordingly, the application in the Defense Letter should be denied.

6 If anything, the Defense Letter suggests that the defendant intends to use criminal discovery 
materials to attack the Government in the Civil Cases, attacks of no discernable relevance in those 
cases and made in a forum in which the Government is not a party and would have no opportunity 
to respond.

Here, even assuming the materials at issue constitute judicial documents, any presumption 
in favor of access is overcome because of the nature of the documents themselves, namely 
materials related to a grand jury investigation. 
In sum, the Government respectfully submits that the exhibits to the Defense Letter, which 
consist entirely of filings that have been ordered sealed by other judicial officers, should similarly 
be filed under seal in this case while the grand jmy investigation remains ongoing. For the same 
reasons the Government ro oses redactin an 
01iions of the Defense Letter that 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Comi pennit the redactions to 
the Defense Letter proposed in Exhibit A hereto and that both the unredacted Defense Letter and 
the exhibits thereto remain under seal until further order of the Comi. Additionall because the 
file a redacted version of this letter on the public docket and that the unredacted version of this 
letter as well as Exhibit A to this letter be filed under seal.

On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed letter motion seeking 
an Order modifying the protective order in this case.1  Specifically, she sought a Court order 
allowing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that 
she received in discovery from the Government in this case.  She also sought permission to 
 
1 This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.  
The Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion that the Government proposed on 
August 21, 2020, and it will enter that version into the public docket.  The Court’s decision to adopt the 
Government’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).  Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the 
documents in question are “judicial documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to 
the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access.  Id. at 119-20.  “Such 
countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’ 
and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 
1048 (2d Cir.1995) (“Amodeo II”)).  The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test.  First, the Court finds 
that the defendant’s letter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test.  United 
States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).  Second, the Court assumes that the common law 
presumption of access attaches, thereby satisfying the second element.  But in balancing competing considerations 
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including, 
most notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury 
investigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrowly tailored redactions.   
 
In light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to 
the Defendant’s reply letter, dated August 24, 2020 and the Defendant’s August 24, 2020 letter addressing her 
proposed redactions to the Defendant’s August 17, 2020 letter motion.  The parties are further ORDERED to submit 
their proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions, 
they shall submit a joint letter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.

reference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.  For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.   
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), a Court may enter a protective order 
only after it finds that good cause exists.  Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing 
protective order is warranted.2  To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant 
factors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has 
sufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant matter.   
On July 30, 2020, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined 
that good cause existed.  Dkt. No. 36.  The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.  
See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating 
to the proposed protective order.”).  The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a 
provision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and 
not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.”  Dkt. No. 29, 
Ex. A ¶ 1(a).  That language was included in the Court’s July 30, 2020 protective order.  See Dkt. 
No. 36 ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a).  Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery. 
Upon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which 
seeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal 
 
2 In the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.”  In re Teligent, 
Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for 
modification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context.  See, e.g., United States v. Calderon, 
No. 3:15-CR-25 (JCH), 2017 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017) (applying the civil standard for the 
modification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. 07-CR-1027 (LAP), 2014 WL 
12710346 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (same).  See also United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (applying the standard for “good cause” in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective 
order entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 2007) (same).

case in other civil proceedings.  She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the 
Documents to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of issues being litigated in those civil matters.  But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated 
rhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to 
why that is the case.  She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to 
make before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in 
this criminal matter under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.  And she 
furnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be 
made in those matters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order 
to allow such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those matters.  In sum, the 
arguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause.  The 
Defendant’s request is DENIED on this basis. 
Indeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further 
lacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the 
judicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the 
Government’s docketed letter on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  In the opening paragraph of her 
reply letter dated August 24, 2020, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose 
under seal to certain judicial officers the following factual information:  
1.  Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government 
opened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-
conspirators;  
2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand 
jury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;

3. In February 2019, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of 
those civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury 
subpoenas;  
4. In April 2019, one court (“Court-1”) permitted the modification and, subsequently, 
another court (“Court-2”) did not;  
5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-1, the 
Recipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by 
the protective order; and  
6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of 
Rule 16 discovery in this criminal matter.   
With the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil 
matters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the letter 
filed on the public docket by the Government on this issue.  See Dkt. No. 46.  Although this 
Court remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that 
those courts can make their own determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by 
the protective order in this matter, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the 
relevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the 
relevant judicial decision makers and civil matters. 
In addition, the Government has indicated that “there is no impediment to counsel 
making sealed applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant 
materials.”  Dkt. No. 46 at 3 n.5.  In her reply, the Defendant asserts that she is amenable to such 
a solution if the Court agrees with the Government that doing so would not contravene the 
protective order in this case.  To the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by the protective

wishes.

# 36), requests that the Comi enter an Order allowing her to refer to and file under seal in-

The Second Circuit has characterized these types of documents as "judicial documents" with 
a presumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 2019). Ms. Maxwell 
objected to the government's Confidential designation, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order, and 
requested that the government withdraw the designation. The Colllt does not need to decide the issue of 
whether the Material is confidential at this time given that Ms. Maxwell seeks only to provide the

cases.

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell then learned, 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
The pressing issue that necessitates the filing of this request concerns 
 
 
These issues, in turn, impact her rights as the accused in this matter, constitutionally presumed 
innocent unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. 
 
The Protective Order in this case 
The Protective Order in this case prohibits the use of the discovery materials or confidential-
designated materials “for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this 
action” absent mutual agreement in writing between the government and defense counsel or if 
“modified by further order of the Court.” Doc. # 36 at ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 18. Ms. Maxwell agreed to 
that limitation after assurances by the government, consistent with their representation to this 
Court, that “the Government rarely provides any third party, including a witness, with any 
material they did not already possess,” and therefore “concerns defense counsel raises about 
future use in civil litigation are not likely to occur.” Letter of Alex Rossmiller at 6 (Doc. # 33) 
(July 28, 2020). This Court relied on that representation in its ruling that government witnesses 
should not be limited in their use of materials gained from the government in any related civil 
litigation. Memorandum Op’n & Order at 3 (July 30, 2020).  Yet as described above, the 
government must have given a copy of the sealed order to 
 
 
 
 
Paragraph 18 of the Protective Order permits modification by the Court.  Further, any concerns 
that the government may raise concerning their on-going grand jury investigation will be 
obviated by submission of  these materials under seal in the other matters.

There are at least three compelling reasons to modify the Protective Order. First, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The partial secrecy surrounding the Material has also fundamentally undermined the fairness of 
the adversarial process. Although the grand jury subpoena and government investigation were 
known to 
 
 
  
 
 
 “The rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on 
witnesses.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6, Advisory Committee Note to Subdivision 6(e)2.  
 
 
 
  Too many questions remain unanswered 
including exactly what was said between the government and 
, when was it said, and 
precisely what was turned over. 
 
 Without the ability to use the 
Material in the very limited fashion proposed Ms. Maxwell she is unfairly disadvantaged 
 
 Moreover, instead of candidly revealing the fact of the subpoena

Further, and as this Court knows, ample Second Circuit authority supports staying a civil case 
pending the resolution of a related criminal case. See SEC v. Blaszczak, No. 17-CV-3919 (AJN), 
2018 WL 301091, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2018) (granting motion to stay civil case and holding 
that “[a] district court may stay civil proceedings when related criminal proceedings are 
imminent or pending, and it will sometimes be prudential to do so” (quoting Louis Vuitton 
Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012))). Among other things, the stay 
vindicates the Fifth Amendment and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil 
case and then “conforming” their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the 
civil case. This concern is all the more real when 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ms. Maxwell further anticipates the very immediate need to disclose the Materials to 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Notably, the Material at issue is not accuser-related or sensitive in any regard. These ex parte 
pleadings, hearings, and rulings are already known to 
. These materials, absent 
sealing, would enjoy a presumptive right of public access as judicial documents. Given that the 
Material has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court’s 
Order, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this 
Court has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court’s Protective 
Order. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues 
related to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion “that neither it 
nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or 
permissible in civil cases.” Doc. # 33 at 7.  What Ms. Maxwell asks is that she be allowed to 
disclose, under seal, the Material so that

Re: 
Proposed Redactions to Request to Modify Protective Order (Under Seal) 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
In accordance with this Comt's Order of August 18, 2020 (Doc. 44), Ms. Maxwell hereby 
respectfully submits m1der seal her proposed redactions to her Request to Modify Protective 
Order ("Request"), filed under seal on August 17, 2020. Ms. Maxwell also has filed her Reply 
under seal and contemporaneously submits her proposed redactions to that pleading.1 
Ms. Maxwell has no opposition to keeping under seal, and redacting from her Request and 
Reply, the contents, description and discussion of the sealed materials themselves; because the 
government has marked them Confidential, the Protective Order requires as much. See Doc. 36, 
,I 15. 
The government's proposed redactions, however, go fmiher and propose to redact--
. The government would 
on the premise that it would "risk jeopardizing the 
government's investigation." 
1 To the extent this Comt believes this letter also should be filed publicly, counsel also has indicated her proposed 
redactions to this letter. 

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 24, 2020 
Page 2 
 
 
   
 
Moreover, the government has made repeated, highly public statements, including at the press 
conference following Ms. Maxwell’s indictment,2 in the press conference following Mr. 
Epstein’s indictment,3 in a press conference convened at the doorstep of Mr. Epstein’s former 
New York mansion,4 and in other publicly-released statements5 that its investigation into 
associates of Mr. Epstein is ongoing and active.  
 
 
 
 
. The process to evaluate whether a 
judicial document should remain under seal is clear. Once a determination is made that the 
materials are judicial documents the Court is required to determine whether any countervailing 
interests outweigh the presumptive right to public access.  Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49-50 
(2d Cir. 2019). 
 
Frankly, Ms. Maxwell does not believe that the government has established a countervailing 
interest compelling enough to justify continued sealing of the documents. 
 
 
 It is also likely that these same documents 
will be the subject of future motion practice in this Court, 
 
   
 
However, Ms. Maxwell has no interest in additional pretrial publicity related to any of these 
documents and submits that protecting her right to a fair trial  is the countervailing interest that, 
at this point, requires her proposed redactions and the continued sealing of the materials with the 
exception of her limited request to file the materials under seal

Re: 
Reply in Suppo1t of Request to Modify Protective Order (Under Seal)1 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a simple request: that she be pennitted to disclose under seal 
to 
(the "Civil 
L • 
ah-eady handed 
over 
.
, to the U.S. Attorney's Office pursuant to a subpoena 
The government proposes to keep-- in the dark about the fact and method of the 
disclosure. They claim the civil litigation is "unrelated," that issuance of the subpoena was 
"standard practice," and that disclosure will jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation and 
"pe1mit dissemination of a vast swath of materials." Each of the government's arguments lack 
merit. 
The Civil Liti ation 
First, the government claims the civil action islllllllllllllResp. at 1. The assertion is 
frivolous. 
1 Ms. Maxwell has filed a letter motion which seeks leave to file this reply under seal, while 
providing the unredacted version to the government and the Comi . This reply desclibes and discusses 
sealed materials and mate1ials subject to the Protective Order in this case. Ms. Maxwell also 
simultaneously files m1der separate cover her proposed redactions to her Request to Modify Protective 
Order (Aug. 17, 2020), and this Reply, in accordance with the Comt's Order of August 18, 2020 (Doc. 
44). 

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

.  The 
government’s ad hominem suggestion that Ms. Maxwell has “cherry-pick[ed] materials” to seek 
an “advantage in their efforts to defend against accusations of abuse” or “delay court-ordered 
disclosure of previously sealed materials” reveals a fundamental (or feigned) lack of 
understanding 
.  It also begs the question, to be fleshed out 
at a later time, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ms. Maxwell simply seeks to alert the judicial officers in the related Civil Litigation to facts 
about which her adversary is already aware. 
 
Issuance of the Subpoenas Not “Standard Practice”:    
Second, the government tries to normalize, without citation to authority, its conduct as “standard 
practice.” Resp. at 2.  To the contrary, the controlling case in this Circuit, Martindell v. Int’l 
Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 1979), mandates a wholly different 
procedure: the use of a non-ex parte subpoena with an opportunity for the aggrieved party to 
move to quash. Similar cases in this district demonstrate the “non-standard” nature of the 
government’s conduct regarding these subpoenas. For example, Judge Koeltl observed when 
considering whether to release a single deposition transcript to the government: “the Second 
Circuit has made clear that the Government may not use its ‘awesome’ investigative powers to 
seek modification of a protective order merely to compare the fruits of the plaintiff's discovery in 
a civil action with the results of a prosecutorial investigation in a criminal action.” Botha v. Don 
King Prods., Inc., No. 97 CIV. 7587 (JGK), 1998 WL 88745, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 1998) 
(citing Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 743 (2d Cir. 1987) and 
Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297).

 see also Palmieri 
v. State of New York, 779 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1987); Abbott Laboratories v. Adelphia Supply USA, 
Case 2015-cv-5826 (CBA) (MDG), 2016 WL 11613256 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2016) (“In the 
Second Circuit, there is a presumption in favor of enforcing protective orders against grand jury 
subpoenas.”); United States v. Kerik, 07 CR 1027, 2014 WL 12710346 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014).  
It seems that a majority of courts in this district have rejected the claimed “standard practice” 
arguments made by the Government 
. A notable difference is that the 
other applications were not conducted ex parte. 
 
 
 
 
 Ms. Maxwell is not 
asking this Court to decide that question today.  
 
But Ms. Maxwell is seeking 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Government Does Not Explain How Any “Secret” Investigation Will be Compromised. 
Third, the government claims that the materials at issue are “Confidential” because the “full 
scope and details” of their very-public proclamations of an ongoing criminal investigation “have 
not been made public.”  Resp. at 3.  This argument too is nonsensical: the sealed materials that 
Ms. Maxwell seeks to file, under seal, 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certainly the subpoena recipient, otherwise known as counsel for the adverse 
party to the Civil Litigation, knows the two things that Ms. Maxwell seeks to file under seal in

that matter:  
 
.2   
 
The government does not explain, because they cannot, how it will harm an ongoing criminal 
investigation to reveal the sealed materials under seal to two arbiters:  
 
 Clearly those judicial officers are fully 
capable of maintaining files under seal and confidences.  Nor is there any support for the 
argument that this limited request will “permit dissemination of a vast swath of materials.”  
Resp. at 3.  The slippery slope contention is belied by the limited nature of Ms. Maxwell’s 
request.  The sealed materials are a discrete set of judicial documents, not a “vast swath of 
materials,” and Ms. Maxwell seeks to file them under seal for those Courts to use in their 
determinations.  Hyperbole aside, the request is appropriately limited. 
 
Further, the government’s suggestion that “there is no impediment to counsel making sealed 
applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials” is, at best, 
baffling.  Resp. at 3 n.5.  Such a “sealed application” in furtherance of her Civil Litigation would 
be “using” the materials for the civil case, exactly the conduct proscribed by the Protective Order 
here.  If the Court disagrees, Ms. Maxwell is more than happy to make such sealed applications 
to those judicial officers.  The government does not explain its thinking, nor did the government 
suggest this course of action during the conferral process. 
 
The Sealed Materials Are Important to 
  
Fourth, the government decries the sealed materials’ lack of relevance to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
2  Ms. Maxwell strenuously opposes the government’s suggestion that it “further elaborate on the nature of the 
ongoing grand jury investigation” in a supplemental ex parte and sealed pleading.  This Court is overseeing the 
criminal case pertaining to Ms. Maxwell and any ex parte pleading concerning this case to this judicial officer is 
inappropriate.  See Standard 3-3.3 Relationship with Courts, Defense Counsel and Others, “Criminal Justice 
Standards for the Prosecution Function,” American Bar Ass’n (4th ed. 2017) (“A prosecutor should not engage in 
unauthorized ex parte discussions with, or submission of material to, a judge relating to a particular matter which is, 
or is likely to be, before the judge.”).

Protective Orders May Be Modified As Circumstances Change 
Finally, the government suggests in a myriad of ways without directly arguing that this 
Protective Order cannot be modified, that Ms. Maxwell somehow waived her ability to seek 
modification by agreeing to a Protective Order before she knew what was contained in the 
criminal discovery, or that there is no precedent for such a modification.  These suggestions are 
disingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that  the Protective Order itself provides that it 
may be modified “by further order of the Court.” Id, ¶ 18(b). 
 
There is no precedence for this case.  That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a 
process for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand 
jury investigations, a process the government circumvented.  It also is true because typically, the 
government is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the 
government has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government 
contends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented.  Finally, there is no other case that 
defense counsel has located where 
 
 
 
 
   
 
That Ms. Maxwell did not know what was in the sealed materials before she signed the 
Protective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident.  That a Court can modify a protective order 
at any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1) authorizes the Court to 
regulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline 
Beecham Corp. v. Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., 210 F.R.D. 163, 166 (M.D.N.C. 2002) 
(“[c]ourts have the inherent power to modify protective orders, including protective orders 
arising from a stipulation by the parties”); see also United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d 1202, 1211 
n.15 (5th Cir. 1977) (trial court's decisions as to which documents “will be placed in the public 
domain, and which are entitled to privacy and confidentiality” are discretionary and “form an 
integral part of trial management”); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3d Cir. 2007), as 
amended (July 2, 2007) (“it would have been proper for the District Court to unseal the records 
pursuant to its general discretionary powers”); Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 532 
& 535 (1st Cir. 1993). 
 
“The standard of review for a request to vacate or modify a protective order depends on the 
nature of the documents in question. There is a presumptive right of public access to judicial

documents, that is, documents that are ‘relevant to the performance of the judicial function and 
useful in the judicial process.’” Kerik, 2014 WL 12710346, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014), 
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995)). 
 
The Materials that Ms. Maxwell seeks to disclose (to judicial officers under seal) are, without 
question, judicial documents. 
 
 
 And, at a minimum, Ms. Maxwell’s opponent in the Civil Litigation knows both that 
the Government obtained an ex parte order to subpoena the information and what was produced. 
Accordingly, the argument that somehow grand jury secrecy will be compromised by disclosure, 
under seal to judicial officers reviewing the very material at issue, is absurd.  Ms. Maxwell has 
demonstrated good cause for her very limited request to present a discrete set of sealed materials 
under seal to 
 
 
 
The government has not articulated a cogent reason for that information to be kept from 
the other judicial officers.   
 
Sincerely,

United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Plaintiff-Appellee, 
—against— 
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
 
 
ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, 20-CR-330 (AJN) 
 
 
Unopposed Motion for Leave to File under Seal and to be 
Excused from Filing Redacted Version of Appendix Volume 2 
 
 
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell, through her attorneys Haddon, 
Morgan and Foreman, P.C., moves unopposed under Federal Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 25(a)(5) and Second Circuit Local Rule 25.1(j)(2) for leave to make 
three filings under seal: (1) the unredacted version of her opening brief (filed 
today); (2) Appendix Volume 2 (filed today); and (3) the unredacted version of 
her response to the government’s opposition to the motion to consolidate (filed 
Case 20-3061, Document 63, 09/24/2020, 2938282, Page2 of 6

yesterday). Ms. Maxwell also requests leave to be excused from publicly filing a 
redacted version of Appendix Volume 2 on ECF. As grounds for this request, 
Ms. Maxwell states: 
This appeal addresses an order by Judge Nathan declining to modify a 
criminal protective order. A related case, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, 
addresses an order by Judge Preska unsealing certain deposition material. Ms. 
Maxwell has filed a motion to consolidate both appeals. Oral argument in both 
appeals is scheduled for October 13. 
1) The unredacted opening brief references material currently under seal 
and/or shielded by the criminal protective order.  
2) Appendix Volume 2 includes all the relevant district court material that 
is sealed/confidential under the criminal protective.  
3) The unredacted version of Ms. Maxwell’s response to the government’s 
opposition to the motion to consolidate makes brief reference to 
confidential/sealed information. 
To comply with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell can file 
unredacted versions of this material only under seal with this Court.  
In compliance with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell will 
publicly file on ECF a redacted copy of her opening brief. She already filed a 
Case 20-3061, Document 63, 09/24/2020, 2938282, Page3 of 6

 
3 
redacted copy of her response to the government’s opposition to the motion to 
consolidate.  
Appendix Volume 2, however, cannot be redacted since the entirety of the 
material therein is sealed/confidential. 
Therefore, Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file under seal (1) the unredacted 
version of her opening brief (filed today); (2) Appendix Volume 2 (filed today); 
and (3) the unredacted version of her response to the government’s opposition to 
the motion to consolidate (filed yesterday). Ms. Maxwell also requests leave to be 
excused from publicly filing a redacted version of Appendix Volume 2 on ECF. 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell conferred with the government regarding this 
motion. The government does not oppose this motion.

1 
Background 
This appeal challenges the district court’s order denying Ms. Maxwell’s 
motion to modify the protective order. Ms. Maxwell’s limited request sought 
permission from Judge Nathan to share certain information with another Article III 
judge. 
The government contends this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Judge 
Nathan’s order. But if the government is right, then Judge Nathan’s order is 
unreviewable. The collateral order doctrine is not so rigid.  
While an interlocutory appeal is the exception and not the rule, all the 
conditions required to satisfy the collateral order doctrine exist here. First, Judge 
Nathan’s order conclusively determined the disputed question (whether Ms. 
Maxwell could share relevant and material information with another Article III 
judge). Second, Judge Nathan’s order resolved an important issue completely 
separate from the merits of the action (whether it is proper for one Article III judge, 
at the request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information 
relevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a matter before her). 
And third, Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final 
judgment (by the time of a final judgment, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the 
deposition material will have gone into effect and Judge Preska will have ruled on 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page2 of 15

 
2 
other unsealing requests and Ms. Maxwell’s intended motion to stay the unsealing 
process, all without the benefit of knowing information relevant to those decisions).  
Finally, the exercise of jurisdiction here adheres to the purposes of the 
collateral order doctrine. The validity of the order can be assessed now without 
waiting until the trial is complete, and nothing about this appeal delays the criminal 
case. 
Alternatively, for the reasons given below, this Court can exercise 
mandamus jurisdiction to correct the district court’s clear abuse of discretion. 
Argument 
I. This Court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. 
This Court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review a 
district court decision declining to modify the protective order. Pichler v. UNITE, 
585 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (3d Cir. 2009) (“We have jurisdiction under the collateral 
order doctrine to review the denial of the motion to modify the Protective Order 
and the denial of the motion to reconsider.”); Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity 
Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. 1987) (denial of motion to modify protective 
order is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine) (citing Cohen v. 
Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545–47 (1949)); see also Brown v. 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page3 of 15

 
3 
Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 44 (2d Cir. 2019) (appeal by intervenors challenging denial of 
motions to modify protective order and unseal). 
Under the collateral order doctrine, an interlocutory order is immediately 
appealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an 
important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) is 
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 
345, 349 (2006) (citing Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 
506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993)). 
The district court’s order declining to modify the protective order meets all 
three requirements: the court conclusively decided not to modify the protective 
order, App. 99–103; the propriety of modifying the protective order is completely 
separate from the merits of the government’s criminal allegations against Ms. 
Maxwell; and appellate review of the order will be impossible following final 
judgment because a post-judgment appeal will be moot since, by that time, Judge 
Preska’s decision unsealing the deposition material in Giuffre v. Maxwell, Nos. 20-
2413 (2d Cir.)/15-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.) will have gone into effect.  
That is the very point of this appeal, after all: to share with Judge Preska the 
critical new information Ms. Maxwell has learned before it’s too late. All 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page4 of 15

Ms. Maxwell asks is for permission to share, under seal, the relevant facts with 
another Article III judge.  
The government argues there is no jurisdiction for this Court to consider this 
appeal. Doc. 37. Quoting Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, the government 
says the collateral order doctrine must be interpreted “with the utmost strictness in 
criminal cases.” 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) (quoting Flanagan v. United States, 465 
U.S. 259, 265 (1984)). Doc. 37 at 8. According to the government, in criminal cases 
the doctrine applies only to orders denying a bond, orders denying a motion to 
dismiss on double jeopardy ground, orders denying a motion to dismiss under the 
Speech and Debate Clause, and orders permitting the forced administration of 
antipsychotic drugs to render a defendant competent for trial. Doc. 37 at 9. The 
government is wrong.  
To be sure, this appeal does not concern one of the four types of orders 
identified by the government. But that doesn’t mean the appeal isn’t proper under 
the collateral order doctrine, particularly when there is no serious argument that it 
satisfies each of the doctrine’s three requirements: Judge Nathan’s order 
(1) conclusively determined the disputed question, (2) it resolved an important 
issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) it is effectively 
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See Will, 546 U.S. at 349. 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page5 of 15

 
5 
In Flanagan v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that an order 
disqualifying criminal counsel pretrial was not immediately appealable under the 
collateral order doctrine. 465 U.S. 259, 266 (1984). The Court explained that unlike 
an order denying a motion to reduce bail, which “becomes moot if review awaits 
conviction and sentence,” an order disqualifying counsel is fully remediable 
posttrial. Id. Moreover, a motion to disqualify counsel is “not independent of the 
issues to be tried” because its “validity cannot be adequately reviewed until trial is 
complete.” Id. at 268. Finally, unlike an appeal of a bail decision, “an appeal of a 
disqualification order interrupts the trial,” and any delay in a criminal case “exacts 
a presumptively prohibitive price.” Id. at 269. 
Unlike the disqualification order at issue in Flanagan, the appeal of Judge 
Nathan’s order is like the appeal of an order denying a motion to reduce bail. First, 
this appeal will “become[] moot if review awaits conviction and sentence.” See id. 
at 266. Unless Ms. Maxwell can share with Judge Preska what she learned from 
Judge Nathan, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition material will go into 
effect without Judge Preska’s getting the chance to reconsider her decision in light 
of the new information. And once the deposition material is unsealed, the cat is 
irretrievably out of the bag. That is precisely why this Court stayed Judge Preska’s 
order pending appeal. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413 (2d Cir.), Doc. 30. 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page6 of 15

Second, the appeal of Judge Nathan’s order is entirely “independent of the 
issues to be tried” in the criminal case and its “validity can[] be adequately 
reviewed” now. See Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 268. There is nothing about 
Ms. Maxwell’s request to share information with Judge Preska that must wait until 
the criminal trial is over. To the contrary, waiting until the criminal trial is over will 
moot the issue. 
Third, this appeal does not and will not delay the criminal case, which is 
proceeding apace despite the proceedings before this Court. See id. at 264 
(explaining that interlocutory appeals in criminal cases are generally disfavored 
because of the “societal interest in providing a speedy trial”).1 
The government’s contentions to the contrary rely on two easily 
distinguishable cases and misunderstand Ms. Maxwell’s arguments on the merits. 
Start with the two cases on which the government relies. Doc. 37, p 11 (citing 
United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. Pappas, 
94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d Cir. 1996)). According to the government, Caparros and 
Pappas hold that “protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged by 
 
1 That the criminal case is proceeding on course despite this appeal confirms 
that this appeal involves an issue completely separate from the merits of the 
criminal action. 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page7 of 15

 
7
the parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.” Doc. 37, 
p 11. That is not correct. 
In Caparros, this Court dismissed an appeal of a protective order issued in a 
criminal case preventing the defendant from making public certain documents 
allegedly concerning public safety. 800 F.2d at 23–24. According to the defendant, 
the prohibition on public disclosure was an unconstitutional prior restraint of 
speech. Id. at 24. This Court dismissed the appeal because it did not satisfy the 
three conditions precedent to interlocutory review, in particular the requirement 
that the issue must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Id. 
at 24–26. Said the Court: 
[The issue] will not become moot on conviction and sentence or on 
acquittal because the order will have continuing prohibitive effect 
thereafter and the purported right to publish the documents, to the 
extent it now exists, will also continue. This is not a situation where an 
order, to be reviewed at all, must be reviewed before the proceedings 
terminate. Nor is there any allegation of grave harm to appellant if the 
order is not immediately reviewed. 
Id. at 26 (internal citations omitted). 
 
This case is not like Caparros. For one thing, Ms. Maxwell does not seek to 
make anything public. To the contrary, she seeks to provide documents to judicial 
officers—under seal—to ensure that all the Article III decisionmakers are on the 
same page about the relevant facts and that Judge Preska does not continue to 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page8 of 15

 
8 
remain in the dark. For another thing, this appeal will become moot if review awaits 
a final judgment in the criminal case, even if the protective order continues to have 
prohibitive effect following the criminal trial. That’s because what Ms. Maxwell 
seeks is permission to share information with Judge Preska now, information that 
should be part of Judge Preska’s decisionmaking in the unsealing process and any 
decision whether to stay that process. And unless Ms. Maxwell can share the 
information now, the request will become moot because there is no way to “re-
seal” a document Judge Preska prematurely unseals without the benefit of knowing 
all the facts.  
Pappas also doesn’t help the government. In Pappas, this Court dismissed in 
part an appeal challenging a protective order prohibiting the defendant from 
disclosing classified information he obtained from the government as part of 
discovery. 94 F.3d at 797. At the same time, the Court accepted jurisdiction over the 
portion of the appeal that challenged the protective order’s bar on disclosure of 
information the defendant acquired from the government before the litigation. Id. 
at 798. This Court distinguished the differing results based on the breadth of the 
protective order’s ban. Id. As this Court said, “to the extent that the order 
prohibits Pappas from disclosure of information he acquired from the Government 
prior to the litigation, the order is not a typical protective order regulating 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page9 of 15

discovery documents and should be appealable because of the breadth of its 
restraint.” Id. (citing United States v. Salameh, 992 F.2d 445, 446–47 (2d Cir. 
1993)). 
Beyond standing for the proposition that interlocutory appeals are the 
exception and not the rule (which Ms. Maxwell doesn’t dispute), Pappas has 
nothing to add to the analysis here. Even strictly construing the three requirements 
for collateral order jurisdiction, see Will, 546 U.S. at 349, the order here meets the 
test. 
The balance of the government’s argument against jurisdiction 
misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s position. For example, according to the 
government, “it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in 
this appeal have been finally resolved.” Doc. 37, p 17. Ms. Maxwell’s argument, 
says the government, is “primarily focused on attacking the legitimacy of the 
Government’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends to use to prosecute 
the criminal case through the Subpoenas to” the recipient. Doc. 37, p 17. Based on 
this understanding, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell “seeks to have this 
Court reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the civil 
appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by the 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page10 of 15

 
10
District Court in the criminal case.” Doc. 37, p 17 (emphasis in original). That is 
not so. 
In the civil appeal, Ms. Maxwell is not asking this Court to rule on the 
propriety of the government’s conduct in circumventing Martindell. Rather, Ms. 
Maxwell’s argument in the civil appeal is that, unless this Court reverses Judge 
Preska’s order unsealing the deposition material, Ms. Maxwell may never be able to 
challenge before Judge Nathan the government’s conduct in obtaining her 
depositions. As Ms. Maxwell said in her opening brief in the appeal of Judge 
Preska’s unsealing order: 
The civil case is not the appropriate forum to litigate the 
government’s apparent violation of Martindell. Ms. Maxwell intends 
to make that argument to Judge Nathan in the criminal case. But if 
Judge Preska’s unsealing order is affirmed and Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition is released, her ability to make that argument before Judge 
Nathan will be prejudiced. Keeping the deposition material sealed will 
preserve the status quo and protect Ms. Maxwell’s right to litigate 
Martindell and the Fifth Amendment in the criminal proceeding.  
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, ECF Dkt. 69, p 33. Only by mischaracterizing 
Ms. Maxwell’s argument can the government contend that she “seeks to have this 
Court reach the merits of her arguments on [the Martindell] issue in the context of 
the civil appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated 
by the District Court in the criminal case.” See Doc. 37, p 17. Ms. Maxwell’s point 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page11 of 15

 
11 
is that, unless the unsealing order is reversed, she likely won’t be able to “properly 
litigate” the Martindell issue at all.  
 
Nor is this appeal the proper forum for deciding whether the government 
improperly circumvented Martindell. All Ms. Maxwell seeks here is an order 
allowing her to share with Judge Preska information that is essential to her decision 
to unseal the deposition material and to rule on a motion to stay, information Judge 
Preska did not know at the time and information the government insists should be 
kept from her. And that issue—whether it is proper for one Article III judge, at the 
request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information 
relevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a matter before her—is 
properly reviewed on an interlocutory basis because it is “an important issue 
completely separate from the merits of the action.” Will, 546 U.S. at 349. 
II. Alternatively, this Court can exercise mandamus jurisdiction. 
Assuming Ms. Maxwell cannot appeal Judge Nathan’s order under the 
collateral order doctrine, this Court should exercise mandamus jurisdiction and 
issue a writ of mandamus directing the district court to modify the protective order 
as requested by Ms. Maxwell. E.g., Wilk v. Am. Med. Ass’n, 635 F.2d 1295, 1298 
(7th Cir. 1980) (declining to decide whether the collateral order applied and instead 
issuing a writ of mandamus to vacate a district court decision declining to modify 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page12 of 15

 
12
protective order), superseded by rule on other grounds as recognized in Bond v. Utreras, 
585 F.3d 1061, 1068 n.4 (7th Cir. 2009); see Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (recognizing that 
protective orders in criminal cases “[i]n rare instances . . . might raise issues 
available for review via a petition for writ of mandamus”). 
A writ of mandamus issued under the All Writs Act “confine[s] the court 
against which mandamus is sought to a lawful exercise of its prescribed 
jurisdiction.” In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal 
quotations omitted). A writ is properly issued when “exceptional circumstances 
amount[] to a . . . clear abuse of discretion.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). 
Three conditions must exist for this Court to issue a writ of mandamus:  
(1) the petitioner must demonstrate the right to issuance of the writ is clear and 
indisputable; (2) she must have no other adequate means to attain the relief 
desired; and (3) the issuing court must be satisfied the writ is appropriate. In re 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany, N.Y., 745 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2014). All three 
conditions exist here. 
First, as explained in her opening brief, Judge Nathan clearly abused her 
discretion in declining to modify the protective order. Doc. 60, pp 23–33.  
Second, Ms. Maxwell has no other adequate means to attain the relief 
necessary because her request for Judge Preska to reevaluate her unsealing order 
Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page13 of 15

 
13
with the benefit of knowing what everyone else knows will become moot once the 
deposition material is unsealed (as this Court already recognized by staying the 
unsealing order pending appeal). 
Finally, it is appropriate for this Court to issue a writ of mandamus because, 
as explained in Ms. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate, the judges in the Southern 
District of New York have reached inconsistent decisions to prejudice of Ms. 
Maxwell. A writ of mandamus is appropriate because only this Court can guarantee 
that all the judges below are on the same page. 
Conclusion 
For these reasons, as well as those given in the opening brief, Doc. 60, pp 10–
22, this Court should deny the government’s motion to dismiss the appeal.

United States Court of Appeals 
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
 
Docket No. 20-3061 
 
 
 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Appellee, 
—v.— 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, also known as Sealed 
Defendant 1, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
 
BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
 
Preliminary Statement 
Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from an order entered 
on September 2, 2020, in the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York, by the 
Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District 
Judge, denying her motion to modify a protective order 
entered by Judge Nathan. 
Superseding Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the 
“Indictment”) was filed on July 8, 2020 charging Max-
well in six counts. The Indictment alleges that be-
tween in or about 1994 and in or about 1997, Maxwell 
assisted, facilitated, and contributed to Jeffrey Ep-
stein’s sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page7 of 37

girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to re-
cruit, groom, and ultimately abuse minor victims. The 
Indictment further alleges that in or about 2016, Max-
well attempted to cover up her crimes by lying under 
oath about her role in Epstein’s scheme. 
On July 30, 2020, upon the Government’s applica-
tion, Judge Nathan entered a protective order govern-
ing the parties’ disclosure of information produced to 
Maxwell by the Government in discovery in the crimi-
nal case (the “Protective Order”). The Protective Or-
der, among other things, prohibits the use of criminal 
discovery materials in civil litigation. Three weeks 
later, Maxwell moved to modify the Protective Order 
to allow Maxwell to use confidential criminal discovery 
materials, which were produced to Maxwell by the 
Government, in filings Maxwell intended to submit in 
separate civil litigation. 
Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s motion on Septem-
ber 2, 2020, holding, among other things, that Maxwell 
had failed to establish good cause to modify the Protec-
tive Order and failed to coherently explain how the 
criminal discovery materials related to any argument 
Maxwell intended to make in the civil litigation. 
Maxwell filed a notice of appeal on September 4, 
2020. 
Statement of Facts 
A. The Indictment 
On June 29, 2020, Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) was 
filed under seal in the Southern District of New York, 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page8 of 37

charging Maxwell in six counts. (A. 4).1 On July 2, 
2020, Maxwell was arrested and the original indict-
ment was unsealed. (A. 4). On July 8, 2020, Supersed-
ing Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) was filed in the 
Southern District of New York. (A. 6). Count One of 
the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiracy to en-
tice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charges Max-
well with enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charges Maxwell with conspiracy to transport 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 
18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charges Maxwell with 
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2. Counts Five and 
Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1623. The matter remains pending in the pre-
trial phase before Judge Nathan. Maxwell’s pretrial 
motions are due on December 21, 2020, and trial has 
been scheduled to commence on July 12, 2021. 
B. The Protective Order 
On July 30, 2020, upon the Government’s applica-
tion, Judge Nathan entered the Protective Order gov-
erning the parties’ disclosure of information produced

in discovery in the criminal case. (A. 75-86). The Pro-
tective Order expressly provides that any and all dis-
covery material produced to Maxwell by the Govern-
ment, regardless of designation, “[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes 
of the defense of this criminal action, and not for any 
civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense 
of this action.” (Protective Order ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a)). 
The Protective Order further provides that any discov-
ery material produced to Maxwell by the Government 
that is marked “confidential” may not be filed publicly 
or excerpted within any public filing. (Protective Order 
¶ 15). Maxwell’s criminal defense counsel consented to 
the foregoing provisions of the Protective Order. (See 
A. 40, 44-55). 
C. The District Court Litigation 
Despite having agreed to the prohibition on using 
the discovery materials in civil cases, on August 17, 
2020, Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to modify the Pro-
tective Order to allow her to do exactly that. (A. 124-
31). In particular, Maxwell’s motion sought authoriza-
tion to use materials relating to applications the Gov-
ernment previously made in 2019 seeking the modifi-
cation of certain protective orders in other judicial pro-
ceedings. 
On August 21, 2020, the Government filed an oppo-
sition to Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Or-
der. (A. 90-94). In its opposition, the Government ex-
plained the factual background regarding the confi-
dential criminal discovery materials at issue. In par-
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page10 of 37

ticular, the Government explained that those discov-
ery materials related to the Government’s requests to 
modify certain protective orders in civil cases to permit 
compliance with grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoe-
nas”). (A. 91). Those Subpoenas were issued to a cer-
tain recipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a 
grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his 
possible co-conspirators. (A. 91). To maintain the in-
tegrity of the grand jury investigation and in accord-
ance with both Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 
6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not 
notify Maxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas. 
(A. 91). In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the 
Recipient advised the Government that it believed 
that certain existing protective orders precluded full 
compliance. (A. 91). Accordingly, in or about February 
2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal 
to each relevant court to request modification of the 
respective protective orders to permit compliance with 
the Subpoenas. (A. 91). In or about April 2019, one 
court (“Court-1”) granted the Government’s applica-
tion, and permitted the Government to share Court-1’s 
order—and only that order, which itself prohibited fur-
ther dissemination—to the Recipient.2 (A. 91). Subse-

The Government notes that this entire litiga-
tion took place months before Judge Preska was as-
signed to handle Giuffre v. Maxwell on July 9, 2019. 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page11 of 37

quently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Gov-
ernment’s application.3 (A. 91). Because the relevant 
grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both Court-
1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding 
the Subpoenas remain under seal, except that both 
have expressly permitted the Government to produce 
those filings to Maxwell as part of its discovery obliga-
tions in this criminal case. (A. 91). 
After providing that factual background, the Gov-
ernment argued that Maxwell’s motion should be de-
nied for failing to show good cause to modify the Pro-
tective Order for several reasons. First, Maxwell had 
consented to the portions of the Protective Order that 
prohibit use of criminal discovery materials produced 
by the Government in any civil litigation. (A. 91-92). 
Second, Maxwell had cited no authority to support the 
argument that a criminal defendant should be permit-
ted to use criminal discovery in civil cases. (A. 93). 
Third, Maxwell utterly failed to explain how the crim-
inal discovery materials at issue supported any legal 
argument she wished to make in civil litigation. 
(A. 94). The Government also noted that to the extent 
Maxwell sought to challenge the process by which the 
Government sought compliance with the Subpoenas 
and obtained certain materials that it intended to use 
in prosecuting its criminal case, she would have a full

The Government notes that Court-1 granted the 
Government’s application first, and then the Govern-
ment provided a copy of Court-1’s decision to Court-2. 
Court-2 then denied the Government’s application. 
(A. 207-37). 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page12 of 37

opportunity to do so in her pretrial motions in the 
criminal case before Judge Nathan. (A. 93-94). 
D. Judge Nathan’s Order 
On September 2, 2020, Judge Nathan issued the 
Order denying Maxwell’s motion. (A. 99-103). In that 
Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite “fourteen-sin-
gle spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had of-
fered “no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory 
assertions” regarding why the criminal discovery ma-
terials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil 
cases. (A. 101). Judge Nathan concluded that absent 
any “coherent explanation” of how the criminal discov-
ery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-
tended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had 
“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the 
Protective Order. (A. 101). Further, Judge Nathan 
noted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce 
in civil litigation were already made public through 
the Government’s letter in opposition to her motion. 
(A. 101-02). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan 
“remain[ed] in the dark as to why this information will 
be relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, 
Judge Nathan expressly permitted Maxwell to inform 
the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of 
the basic factual background regarding the confiden-
tial criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. 101-02). 
E. 
Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order 
On September 4, 2020, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-
peal from the Order. (A. 121-23). On September 10, 
2020, Maxwell filed a motion to consolidate this appeal 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page13 of 37

8 
 
with the appeal currently pending in Giuffre v. Max-
well, No. 20-2413. (2d Cir. Dkt. 17). The Government 
is not a party to the appeal in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
which concerns an order issued in a civil case unseal-
ing materials that were previously filed under seal. On 
September 16, 2020, the Government filed a motion to 
dismiss Maxwell’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and 
requested that this Court deny Maxwell’s motion for 
consolidation (the “Motion to Dismiss”). (2d Cir. Dkt. 
37). 
A R G U M E N T  
POINT I 
This Court Lacks Jurisdiction To Hear This Appeal 
As explained in the Government’s Motion to Dis-
miss, the final judgment rule precludes jurisdiction 
over Maxwell’s appeal of the Order. See 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1291. Maxwell fails to explain how the Order falls 
within the “small class” of decisions that constitute im-
mediately appealable collateral orders. See Van Cau-
wenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 522 (1988). Accord-
ingly, this Court should dismiss Maxwell’s appeal for 
lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
A. Applicable Law 
Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291 ex-
pressly limits the jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals to 
“final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. 
“This final judgment rule requires that a party must 
ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page14 of 37

9 
 
following final judgment on the merits. In a criminal 
case[,] the rule prohibits appellate review until convic-
tion and imposition of sentence.” Flanagan v. United 
States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984); accord United States 
v. Aliotta, 199 F.3d 78, 81 (2d Cir. 1999). As the Su-
preme Court has “long held,” the “policy of Congress 
embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal ap-
pellate review of trial court decisions which do not ter-
minate the litigation, and . . . this policy is at its 
strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. 
Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U.S. 263, 265 (1982); see 
also Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 270 (noting “overriding pol-
icies against interlocutory review in criminal cases” 
and that “exceptions to the final judgment rule in crim-
inal cases are rare”); United States v. Culbertson, 598 
F.3d 40, 46 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that “undue li-
tigiousness and leaden-footed administration of jus-
tice, the common consequences of piecemeal appellate 
review, are particularly damaging to the conduct of 
criminal cases”). 
There is a limited exception to this rule that per-
mits immediate appeal from certain collateral orders. 
See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 467-
68 (1978) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan 
Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949)). To fall within the “small 
class” of decisions that constitute immediately appeal-
able collateral orders, the decision must “(1) conclu-
sively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an 
important issue completely separate from the merits 
of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on ap-
peal from a final judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 
U.S. at 522. 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page15 of 37

10 
 
The Supreme Court has made clear that the collat-
eral order exception should be “interpreted . . . with the 
utmost strictness in criminal cases.” Midland Asphalt 
Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989); accord 
United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 487, 490 (2d Cir. 
2007). In over 70 years since Cohen was decided, de-
spite “numerous opportunities” to expand the doctrine, 
Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799, the Supreme Court 
has identified only four types of pretrial orders in crim-
inal cases as satisfying the collateral-order doctrine: 
an order denying a bond, see Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 
(1951); an order denying a motion to dismiss on Double 
Jeopardy grounds, see Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 
651 (1977); an order denying a motion to dismiss under 
the Speech or Debate Clause, see Helstoski v. Meanor, 
442 U.S. 500 (1979); and an order permitting the 
forced administration of antipsychotic drugs to render 
a defendant competent for trial, see Sell v. United 
States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003). In contrast, the circum-
stances in which the Supreme Court has “refused to 
permit interlocutory appeals” in criminal cases have 
been “far more numerous.” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. 
at 799. 
As to the third Van Cauwenberghe criterion, “[a]n 
order is effectively unreviewable where the order at is-
sue involves an asserted right the legal and practical 
value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindi-
cated before trial.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d 1, 
5 (2d Cir. 2013). “The justification for immediate ap-
peal must . . . be sufficiently strong to overcome the 
usual benefits of deferring appeal until litigation con-
cludes.” Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 
100, 107 (2009). A ruling that is burdensome to a party 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page16 of 37

11 
 
“in ways that are only imperfectly reparable by appel-
late reversal of a final district court judgment is not 
sufficient.” Punn, 737 F.3d at 5. “Instead, the decisive 
consideration is whether delaying review until the en-
try of final judgment would imperil a substantial pub-
lic interest or some particular value of a high order.” 
Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 107; see also Kensington 
Int’l Ltd. v. Republic of Congo, 461 F.3d 238, 241 (2d 
Cir. 2006). In a criminal case, the availability of post-
judgment relief through reversal or vacatur of convic-
tion, if warranted, will generally be sufficient to pro-
tect whatever right a defendant claims was abridged 
by the district court’s pretrial decision. See, e.g., Punn, 
737 F.3d at 14 (“Punn’s claim can be adequately vindi-
cated upon appeal from a final judgment. . . . [I]f 
Punn’s arguments continue to fail before the district 
court, purportedly ill-gotten evidence or its fruits are 
admitted at his trial, and conviction results, appellate 
review will be available at that point[,] . . . [and the 
Court] may order a new trial without the use of the ill-
gotten evidence, or whatever additional remedies are 
necessary to ensure that Punn’s legitimate interests 
are fully preserved.”); United States v. Hitchcock, 992 
F.2d 236, 239 (9th Cir. 1993) (district court’s refusal to 
seal documents not immediately appealable because 
“[r]eversal after trial, if it is warranted, will ade-
quately protect . . . interest[s]” asserted by defend-
ants). 
When applying the collateral order doctrine, the 
Supreme Court has “generally denied review of pre-
trial discovery orders.” Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. 
Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (1981). This Court likewise 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page17 of 37

12 
 
has consistently ruled that protective orders regulat-
ing the use of documents exchanged by the parties dur-
ing a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory ap-
peal. See, e.g., United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 
24 (2d Cir. 1986) (“We hold that this collateral protec-
tive order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 
. . . .”); United States v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d 
Cir. 1996) (“To the extent that the [protective] order 
imposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of mate-
rials exchanged in the course of pending litigation, it 
is not subject to appeal.”); see also H.L. Hayden Co. of 
N.Y. v. Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 90 (2d 
Cir. 1986) (“The district court’s denial of modification 
[of a protective order] does not fall within the ‘collat-
eral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”). Because “a litigant 
does not have an unrestrained right to disseminate in-
formation that has been obtained through pretrial dis-
covery,” such protective orders do not amount to an im-
permissible prior restraint under the First Amend-
ment. Caparros, 800 F.2d at 25. Even where a litigant 
raises a colorable argument that a protective order vi-
olates a litigant’s right to release documents outside of 
criminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right can 
await final judgment on the underlying charges” be-
cause the “purported right at issue is not related to any 
right not to stand trial.” Id. at 26. 
B. Discussion 
Maxwell’s jurisdictional arguments run afoul of 
this Circuit’s precedent and offer no justification for 
including the Order in the “small class” of decisions 
that constitute immediately appealable collateral or-
ders. See Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522. In her 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page18 of 37

13 
 
opening brief, Maxwell concedes that her appeal of the 
Order does not concern one of the four types of pretrial 
orders that the Supreme Court has identified as satis-
fying the collateral order doctrine in criminal cases, 
but she fails to offer a basis for expanding those cate-
gories to embrace her claim here. (Br. 12.) The rights 
implicated by the Order—namely, the use of pretrial 
discovery materials—do not justify expanding the lim-
ited collateral order exception, which is “interpreted 
. . . with the utmost strictness.” Midland Asphalt, 489 
U.S. at 799. 
Maxwell relies principally on three cases in seeking 
to overcome decades of Supreme Court precedent nar-
rowly construing the exception to the requirement that 
appeals in criminal cases be from the final judgment 
of conviction. As discussed in the Government’s Motion 
to Dismiss, the cases Maxwell cites do not support the 
existence of an exception here. All three cases involved 
appeals by intervenors—not parties—seeking to mod-
ify protective orders in civil cases. Pichler v. UNITE, 
585 F.3d 741, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2009) (third party inter-
venor foundation appealing order denying motion to 
modify protective order in civil litigation to allow third 
party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v. 
Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 741 (2d Cir. 
1987) (Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(“CFTC”) acting as third party intervenor appealing 
order denying motion to modify protective order in 
civil litigation to allow CFTC to obtain discovery ex-
changed by parties to civil case permissible because 
“[t]he entire controversy between the CFTC and the 
defendants in this case was disposed of by the district 
court’s denial of the government’s motion to modify the 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page19 of 37

14 
 
protective order”); Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 46 
(2d Cir. 2019) (third party intervenors, including mem-
bers of the press, appealing order denying motion to 
modify protective order in civil litigation to allow third 
parties access to sealed filings, after parties to the lit-
igation settled). Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those 
cases was founded on the principle that when interve-
nors seek access to sealed records, “orders denying ac-
cess are final as to the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyra-
mid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2006) 
(emphasis added). Once the courts in those cases de-
nied the intervenors’ motions to modify protective or-
ders, there was nothing left for those intervenors to lit-
igate. Here, by contrast, Judge Nathan’s Order did not 
end the entire litigation as to Maxwell. To the con-
trary, Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in 
December 2020 and to proceed to trial in July 2021. 
When considering interlocutory appeals from rul-
ings on protective orders governing a criminal defend-
ant’s use of discovery materials, by contrast, this Court 
has concluded it lacks jurisdiction. See Caparros, 800 
F.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. Maxwell cites no 
case in which this Court has found jurisdiction over an 
interlocutory appeal of an order regulating the use of 
materials a criminal defendant received during litiga-
tion, and her efforts to distinguish Pappas and Capar-
ros fall short. Pappas concluded that where a protec-
tive order “prohibits . . . disclosure of information [a de-
fendant] acquired from the Government prior to the 
litigation, the order is not a typical protective order 
regulating discovery documents and should be appeal-
able because of the breadth of its restraint.” Pappas, 
94 F.3d at 798 (emphasis added). But that is not the 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page20 of 37

15 
 
type of protective order at issue here. To the contrary, 
the Protective Order in this case expressly provides 
that its provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-
ing disclosure of any information, with the exception 
of victim or witness identifying information, that is 
publicly available or obtained by the Defendant or her 
Defense Counsel form a source other than the Govern-
ment.” (A. 84-85). Instead, the Protective Order “im-
posed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-
als exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and, 
like the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-
der, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry 
of final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. 
Caparros is similarly analogous. That case declined 
to find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-
sons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue 
is not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 800 
F.2d at 26. The Court also concluded that the protec-
tive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal 
after final judgment and emphasized that the defend-
ant would not suffer any “grave harm . . . if the order 
is not immediately reviewed.” Id. So too here. Maxwell 
has not articulated any serious injury she will suffer if 
this Court dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical 
harm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising 
from the unsealing of filings in a civil case. Should any 
prejudicial publicity arise, though, Maxwell will be 
fully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry 
of final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United 
States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2010) 
(evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether public-
ity biased the venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 515 
F.3d 100, 128-31 (2d Cir. 2008) (evaluating on post-
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page21 of 37

16 
 
judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial ju-
rors); United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d 164, 201-04, 
213 (2d Cir. 2002) (vacating conviction where district 
court improperly refused to excuse potential juror who 
admitted bias based upon knowledge of defendant’s 
previous acquittal). Accordingly, like the protective or-
der in Caparros, the Order here will still be reviewable 
on appeal after entry of final judgment. 
In evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, the Court should 
“not engage in an individualized jurisdictional in-
quiry,” but instead focus “on the entire category to 
which a claim belongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 107. The 
Order declining to modify the Protective Order is not 
subject to interlocutory appeal as “[p]rotective orders 
that only regulate materials exchanged between the 
parties incident to litigation, like most discovery or-
ders, are neither final orders, appealable under 28 
U.S.C. § 1291, nor injunctions, appealable under 28 
U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).” Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. 
Maxwell nevertheless asks this Court to engage in 
an individualized jurisdictional inquiry to justify her 
immediate appeal. Contrary to Maxwell’s claims, the 
Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard 
for identifying immediately appealable collateral or-
ders, which requires that the order being appealed 
from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a fi-
nal judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522. 
She likens her claim here to an appeal of an order 
denying a motion to reduce bail, arguing that her ap-
peal “will become moot if review awaits conviction and 
sentence.” (Br. 13 (quotation omitted)). But that is not 
so. In an order denying a motion to reduce bail, the 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page22 of 37

17 
 
“issue is finally resolved and is independent of the is-
sues to be tried, and the order becomes moot if review 
awaits conviction and sentence.” Flanagan, 465 U.S. 
at 266. Unlike a request for bail reduction, however, 
an order denying modification of a protective order 
does not become moot upon conviction and sentence. 
“The standard for review set forth in Flanagan is 
not easily met,” and Maxwell has not done so here. Ca-
parros, 800 F.2d at 25. To the extent Maxwell still 
wishes to use materials she obtained through criminal 
discovery for other purposes after entry of final judg-
ment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization 
from this Court to do so then. If Maxwell complains 
that her inability to use criminal discovery materials 
in civil matters may result in premature unsealing or 
prejudicial pretrial publicity, she can likewise raise 
those claims before this Court on appeal after entry of 
final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United 
States v. Martoma, No. 13-4807, 2014 WL 68119, at *1 
(2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2014) (concluding that even though the 
defendant’s “personal interest in the privacy of embar-
rassing information is an interest that, as a practical 
matter, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that in-
terest is insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal); 
United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d 990, 998 (9th Cir. 
2012) (finding no jurisdiction over defendant’s inter-
locutory appeal from unsealing of competency evalua-
tion because “any alleged incursions on criminal de-
fendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not ren-
der the unsealing order effectively unreviewable on ap-
peal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district court’s 
refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable 
because “[r]eversal after trial, if it is warranted, will 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page23 of 37

18 
 
adequately protect . . . interest[s]” asserted by defend-
ant); cf. Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 109 (holding that 
orders to disclose privileged information are not imme-
diately appealable even though they “intrude[ ] on the 
confidentiality of attorney-client communications”). If 
Maxwell is concerned that unsealing will open up an 
inevitable discovery argument for the Government, 
she can explain to Judge Nathan when making a sup-
pression motion how an unsealing decision would have 
been altered by revelation of criminal discovery mate-
rials to the unsealing court.4 If Maxwell is dissatisfied 
with the result of that suppression motion, she can 
raise the issue on appeal following final judgement. In 
short, because Judge Nathan’s Order is not effectively 
unreviewable on appeal after final judgment, Maxwell 
cannot satisfy the third prong of the collateral order 
doctrine.5 
————— 
4 
Notably, though, Maxwell has not explained 
how her desire to prevent the Government from mak-
ing an inevitable discovery argument has any bearing 
on Judge Preska’s analysis of whether the First 
Amendment requires unsealing of judicial documents 
in a civil case. She offers no case law to support such 
an argument and does not articulate how her desire to 
prevent the Government from making an inevitable 
discovery argument impacts the unsealing analysis in 
a civil case. 
5 
In support of her argument in favor of expand-
ing the collateral order doctrine to embrace her inter-
locutory appeal here, Maxwell suggests that this ap-
peal has not and will not delay the criminal case. 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page24 of 37

19 
 
Maxwell nevertheless argues that reversal of the 
Order is necessary to prevent documents in a civil case 
from being unsealed. As further described below, Max-
well fails to explain how the way the Government ob-
tained the confidential criminal discovery materials at 
issue has any bearing on or in any way affects First 
Amendment principles governing unsealing decisions 
in a civil case. Second, and as further described below, 
Maxwell is already able to share the essential facts she 
wishes to convey under Judge Nathan’s Order. As 
such, she has not shown how the Order damages her 
in any way. See Caparros, 800 F.2d at 26 (without a 
showing of serious harm, “review cannot be granted 
under section 1292(a)(1)”).6 
————— 
(Br. 14). That remains to be seen. In the meantime, the 
litigation of this appeal undoubtedly consumes the re-
sources of the parties, who must now litigate an issue 
twice in the middle of a pending criminal case—once 
before the District Court and a second time before this 
Court. It would be a much more efficient use of re-
sources for the parties to focus on completing the crim-
inal discovery process, preparing pretrial motions, and 
trial, after which any appeal consolidating all claimed 
errors could be taken. 
6 
As noted in the Government’s Motion to Dis-
miss, 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) provides that Courts of 
Appeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory 
orders of the district courts of the United States . . . or 
of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, 
refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dis-
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page25 of 37

20 
 
In an attempt to sidestep the jurisdictional issue, 
Maxwell suggests that this Court should exercise man-
damus jurisdiction and issue the extraordinary relief 
of a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to 
modify the Protective Order if Maxwell “cannot ap-
peal” the Order under the collateral order doctrine. 
(Br. 20). The Supreme Court has described this as “a 
drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really 
extraordinary causes.” Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for 
Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004). This Court 
has made clear that it “issue[s] a writ of mandamus 
only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judi-
cial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion.” 
In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010). 
“Pretrial discovery orders . . . generally are not re-
viewable on direct appeal, and we have expressed re-
luctance to circumvent this salutary rule by use of 
mandamus.” In re S.E.C. ex rel. Glotzer, 374 F.3d 184, 
187 (2d Cir. 2004). “Nevertheless, mandamus may be 
available where a discovery question is of extraordi-
nary significance or there is extreme need for reversal 
of the district court’s mandate before the case goes to 
judgment.” Id. “To determine whether mandamus is 
appropriate in the context of a discovery ruling, we 
————— 
solve or modify injunctions, except where a direct re-
view may be had in the Supreme Court.” Orders regu-
lating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched us-
ing “words of restraint,” are not injunctions and are 
therefore not appealable under § 1292(a)(1). See Pap-
pas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 800 F.2d at 26. 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page26 of 37

21 
 
look primarily for the presence of a novel and signifi-
cant question of law . . . and . . . the presence of a legal 
issue whose resolution will aid in the administration 
of justice.” In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d at 939. 
As described below, the District Court did not 
abuse its discretion in issuing the Order. This Court 
should not issue a writ of mandamus and should in-
stead follow its “normal practice . . . to decline to treat 
improvident appeals as mandamus petitions.” Capar-
ros, 800 F.2d at 26. This case does not raise the rare 
and exceptional circumstance in which the Court 
should depart from its practice. 
POINT II 
The District Court Did Not Abuse Its 
Discretion in Denying Maxwell’s Motion 
to Modify the Protective Order 
Even if this Court had jurisdiction to hear Max-
well’s appeal, the Order should be summarily affirmed 
because the District Court did not abuse its discretion. 
The Order—which was issued after receiving briefing 
from the parties—carefully evaluated Maxwell’s re-
quest and reached a conclusion indisputably within 
the bounds of permissible discretion. 
A. Applicable Law 
This Court reviews a district court’s decision deny-
ing modification of a protective order for abuse of dis-
cretion. See, e.g., United States v. Longueuil, 567 F. 
App’x 13, 16 (2d Cir. 2014) (finding that the district 
court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page27 of 37

22 
 
to vacate a protective order); S.E.C. v. The Street.com, 
273 F.3d 222, 228-29 (2d Cir. 2001) (reviewing the dis-
trict court’s order lifting its protective order covering 
deposition testimony for abuse of discretion). “A dis-
trict court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to 
it when (1) its decision rests on an error of law (such 
as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly 
erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision—though 
not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly 
erroneous factual finding—cannot be located within 
the range of permissible decisions.” Id. 
Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 
the District Court is vested with broad discretion to 
oversee the criminal discovery process, including en-
tering protective orders “for good cause [that] deny, re-
strict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other 
appropriate relief.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d). Courts over-
seeing criminal cases in this Circuit have borrowed 
from the standard governing modification of protective 
orders in civil cases, in which there is a “strong pre-
sumption against the modification of a protective or-
der.” In re Teligent, Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011). 
See, e.g., United States v. Kerik, No. 07 Cr. 1027 (LAP), 
2014 WL 12710346, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (ap-
plying civil standard for modification of protective or-
der in criminal case and holding that modification of 
Rule 16 protective order is “ ‘presumptively unfair’ ” 
where a party reasonably relied upon the order); see 
also United States v. Calderon, No. 15 Cr. 25 (JCH), 
2017 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. 1, 2017); 
United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (borrowing from the standard for “good cause” 
under Fed. R. Civ. P 26(c) when evaluating whether to 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page28 of 37

23 
 
modify a protective order entered in a criminal case); 
United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 
2007) (same). 
B. Discussion 
Judge Nathan did not abuse her discretion when 
entering the challenged Order. In reaching her deci-
sion, Judge Nathan applied the correct legal standard, 
evaluated Maxwell’s argument that she needed to dis-
close certain criminal discovery materials to the rele-
vant judicial officers to “ensure the fair adjudication of 
issues being litigated in those civil matter,” found that 
Maxwell’s proffered reasons for the request were 
“vague, speculative, and conclusory,” and concluded 
that Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to establish 
good cause.” (A. 101). At no point did Judge Nathan 
fail to apply established law, and it cannot be said that 
her careful review of the parties’ arguments was not 
within the bounds of permissible discretion. 
First, Maxwell still fails to articulate any legal ba-
sis for the use of discovery material received from the 
Government in a criminal case to litigate a separate 
civil case. Maxwell expressly consented to the entry of 
a Protective Order prohibiting her from using criminal 
discovery materials in civil litigation.7 In her motion 
to modify that Protective Order, Maxwell cited no legal 
authority for the use of criminal discovery in civil liti-
gation. Her appeal points to no such authority, and she 
————— 
7 
Maxwell did so knowing that the Government 
had charged her with perjury in connection with civil 
cases. 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page29 of 37

24 
 
does not suggest that Judge Nathan committed legal 
error when issuing the Order denying her motion. 
Second, Judge Nathan did not abuse her discretion 
when determining that Maxwell had offered no basis 
for determining that good cause justified a modifica-
tion of the Protective Order. In her briefing before the 
District Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explana-
tion of how the criminal discovery materials could 
have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in 
civil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that, 
for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery 
argument by the Government should foreclose unseal-
ing in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be 
affected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a sep-
arate criminal case. In the absence of any such expla-
nation, Judge Nathan’s Order declining to modify the 
Protective Order did not amount to an abuse of her 
broad discretion when overseeing an ongoing criminal 
case. 
Even on this appeal, Maxwell still fails to explain 
why she needs to use materials relating to the Govern-
ment’s applications seeking the modification of certain 
protective orders in other judicial proceedings. As far 
as the Government is aware, the only issue pending in 
the civil litigation in which Maxwell seeks to use those 
criminal discovery materials involves whether the 
First Amendment requires that certain filings in those 
cases be made available on the public docket. Maxwell 
cannot explain why certain criminal discovery materi-
als are relevant to the issues pending in those cases or 
how the manner in which the Government obtained 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page30 of 37

25 
 
certain discovery materials would impact the unseal-
ing analysis under First Amendment principles in a 
civil matter. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way 
in which the Government obtained the materials was 
improper—and she is not—that fact would have no 
bearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain 
civil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-
gle case to support the conclusion that her desire to 
prevent the Government from raising an inevitable 
discovery argument in suppression litigation should 
impact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers 
no coherent argument for how the criminal discovery 
materials would impact any decision in a civil case. 
At bottom, it remains unclear what legal argument 
Maxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the 
criminal discovery materials she has identified or 
what relevance those materials have to the litigation 
of those civil matters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did 
not abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-
well “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding 
the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made 
in those matters, let alone any explanation of why 
modifying the protective order in order to allow such 
disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of those matters.” (A. 101). 
In pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-
gues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it 
may foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan 
about the perjury counts or other remedies available 
to Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-
vention of Second Circuit law. (Br. 27). Maxwell claims 
that “all [she] seeks in this appeal is the ability to 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page31 of 37

26 
 
make these arguments to Judge Preska and Judge Na-
than before it’s too late.” (Br. 27-28). To the extent 
Maxwell seeks to challenge the manner in which the 
Government obtained the materials at issue—a chal-
lenge that itself would not justify the relief presently 
requested—Maxwell can make such arguments before 
Judge Nathan, and the Government can and will vig-
orously oppose them, at the appropriate stage in the 
case. 
If anything, this appeal appears to be a thinly 
veiled attempt to have this Court weigh in on the Gov-
ernment’s investigative methods. Her briefing is filled 
with accusations of impropriety on the part of the Gov-
ernment but with virtually no explanation of how that 
supposed impropriety relates to any civil case. It ap-
pears that Maxwell would like this Court to agree that 
the Government illegally obtained evidence before the 
issue has even been briefed before Judge Nathan. This 
Court’s precedents do not countenance such efforts to 
bypass district courts. See, e.g., Frontera Res. Azer. 
Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azer. Republic, 582 F.3d 
393, 401 (2d Cir. 2009) (because issue “ha[d] not been 
decided” by district court, “it would be premature for 
us to address this question without hearing first from 
the court below”). Maxwell presents no sound reason 
to deviate from precedent here, nor is one readily ap-
parent. Maxwell is fully capable of litigating any sup-
pression motions in the District Court, and will have 
an opportunity to do so. 
Maxwell suggests that the “very point of this ap-
peal” is to share information with Judge Preska under 
seal. (Br. 11). She asks that this Court permit her to 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page32 of 37

27 
 
“tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge 
Preska decide whether the information weighs against 
unsealing the deposition material or in favor of a stay.” 
(Br. 31). To the extent Maxwell seeks to inform Judge 
Preska—or any other judicial officer—of the basic facts 
surrounding the criminal prosecution and the criminal 
discovery materials at issue, the District Court has al-
ready granted Maxwell the supposed relief she seeks 
from this Court. Although the District Court did not 
modify the Protective Order, Judge Nathan authorized 
Maxwell to convey, under seal, to the appropriate ju-
dicial officer the fact that the Government obtained an 
order from Court-1 permitting the Recipient to comply 
with a subpoena for materials covered by a protective 
order, that Court-2 subsequently denied similar relief 
in another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this in-
formation (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule 
16 discovery in this criminal matter.” (A. 101-02). If 
the “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-
cation of the Protective Order was to share infor-
mation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-
ment’s investigative techniques, then her appeal is 
moot because Judge Nathan has already granted her 
permission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why 
those facts are not enough. 
Despite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-
gues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-
cess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her 
right to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As 
already noted, though, it is a matter of public record 
that the charges against Maxwell include allegations 
of perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29). Without relying on 
any materials she received through criminal discovery, 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page33 of 37

28 
 
Maxwell can argue on the public record that unsealing 
the materials would have a prejudicial effect on her 
right to a fair trial. To the extent Maxwell complains 
that unsealing filings in a civil case may result in un-
fair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, she will 
have the opportunity to request that the District Court 
establish practices to help ensure she gets a fair and 
impartial jury.8 If she is displeased with those efforts, 
————— 
8 
Maxwell makes much of the Government hav-
ing moved to intervene and stay the proceedings in Doe 
v. Indyke, noting that the Government has not moved 
to intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unseal-
ing process. (Br. 29). Maxwell suggests that the Gov-
ernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-
principled” reasons. (Br. 29-30). Setting Maxwell’s 
conspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v. 
Maxwell are in completely different procedural pos-
tures, which implicate different concerns regarding a 
pending criminal case. The latter was resolved in 2017 
and the determination of what material should remain 
sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there 
is no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case 
and no possible concern to the Government that, for 
example, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might 
be deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that 
a document may be unsealed through an independent 
process before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-
ernment’s investigative focus or techniques. 
In Doe v. Indyke, on the other hand, discovery was 
just beginning, and if discovery were to have pro-
ceeded, multiple witnesses or potential witnesses at 
Case 20-3061, Document 82, 10/02/2020, 2944267, Page34 of 37

29 
 
she can appeal to this Court following the entry of final 
judgment in the criminal case. 
Maxwell presented Judge Nathan with no coherent 
reason—not to mention good cause—to modify the 
duly entered Protective Order in this criminal case. In 
the absence of any explanation of Maxwell’s need to 
use criminal discovery materials to litigate a civil case, 
Judge Nathan was well within her discretion when de-
termining that Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to es-
tablish good cause.” (A. 101). Judge Nathan’s Order 
falls comfortably within the range of permissible deci-
sions on a motion to modify a protective order, and so 
she did not abuse her discretion in so ruling. 
————— 
the criminal trial would likely have been subject to 
deposition. That concern, among others, raised a sig-
nificant risk that proceeding with the civil matter 
would adversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecu-
tion against Maxwell. Moreover, the interests of judi-
cial economy and the public interest in enforcement of 
the criminal law were served by a stay in the Doe case 
because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve 
disputed issues in the Doe case. Such concerns are not 
present in Giuffre v. Maxwell.

Introduction 
The government’s brief suffers from two fundamental flaws. It obscures the 
relief Ms. Maxwell actually seeks, and it confuses the arguments she actually 
makes.  
As to the relief she seeks, Ms. Maxwell’s request is specific and narrow:  She 
seeks permission to share relevant information, under seal, with other Article III 
judicial officers, specifically Judge Preska and the panel of this Court deciding the 
appeal of Judge Preska’s order unsealing the civil deposition material, Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, No. 20-2413. Only by obscuring what Ms. Maxwell actually seeks can the 
government claim with a straight face that this appeal won’t be moot if this Court 
declines to exercise jurisdiction now. 
As to the arguments she makes, there are several (fairly obvious) reasons 
why Judge Preska and this Court should know just how prosecutors obtained the 
deposition material and who turned it over to them. If Judge Preska knew this 
information, she might very well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell’s deposition 
transcripts to protect Ms. Maxwell’s ability in the criminal case to litigate the 
government’s violation of Martindell v. International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 
594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), cited with approval in In re Teligent, Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 58 
(2d Cir. 2011). She might also reconsider whether Ms. Maxwell reasonably relied 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page4 of 23

 
2 
on the civil protective order’s guarantee of confidentiality in declining to invoke 
her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  
Instead of fairly addressing these arguments, however, the government 
retreats to the claim that Ms. Maxwell “does not articulate” or “does not explain” 
why Judge Preska and this Court need to know 
 
. Ans.Br. 18 n.4 & 
27. But just because the government lacks a persuasive response does not mean Ms. 
Maxwell hasn’t explained or articulated herself.  
The question then is what could justify keeping Judge Preska and this Court 
in the dark about the relevant facts. And if that’s the question, the government’s 
brief provides no answer. 
Jurisdiction 
There are three conditions to seeking interlocutory review under the 
collateral order doctrine: The order on appeal must (1) conclusively determine the 
disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the 
merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final 
judgment. Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 349 (2006) (citing Puerto Rico Aqueduct & 
Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993)). The government 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page5 of 23

 
3 
does not appear to dispute that Judge Nathan’s order satisfies the first two 
conditions.1  
Instead, the government focuses on the third condition, arguing that Ms. 
Maxwell can appeal Judge Nathan’s order after her criminal jury trial. Ans.Br. 16. 
But the government can make this argument only by obscuring the relief Ms. 
Maxwell actually seeks.  
To be clear, Ms. Maxwell seeks permission to share with Judge Preska and 
this Court, under seal, just what the government obtained 
 
 
 
 
1 Perhaps suggesting that Judge Nathan’s order is not “final,” the 
government notes that the order “did not end the entire litigation as to [Ms.] 
Maxwell. To the contrary, [Ms.] Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in 
December 2020 and to proceed to trial in July 2021.” Ans.Br. 14.  
This is just a truism, as no one disputes that “Judge Nathan’s Order did not 
end the entire litigation.” If it had, Ms. Maxwell would have invoked this Court’s 
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  
But it is because “Judge Nathan’s Order did not end the entire litigation” 
that Ms. Maxwell invokes the collateral order doctrine as a basis for this Court’s 
jurisdiction. And in evaluating the applicability of that doctrine, the government 
does not appear to dispute that Judge Nathan’s order “conclusively determined 
the disputed question”:  Whether the criminal protective order should be modified. 
That is all “finality” requires in the collateral order context. 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page6 of 23

 
4 
 and how it obtained it (by circumventing 
this Court’s decision in Martindell).  
Judge Preska needs that information now, not later, because her order 
unsealing the deposition material is about to go into effect and because she is poised 
to decide whether and to what extent to keep unsealing the sealed material in the 
civil case
. The panel of this Court reviewing 
Judge Preska’s order needs that information now, not later, because it is poised to 
review Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition material without the benefit 
of knowing all the relevant information. And unless this Court is privy to the 
relevant information, it won’t be able to decide whether Judge Preska should 
reconsider her order given 
. Ms. 
Maxwell simply asks this Court to review these issues now, before it’s too late.  
A post-trial appeal will be too late. By that time, if this Court affirms Judge 
Preska’s unsealing order without the benefit of knowing all the facts, Ms. 
Maxwell’s April 2016 deposition will be publicly released. By that time, Judge 
Preska will have largely if not entirely decided what other material from the civil 
case should be unsealed. By that time, it will be too late for Ms. Maxwell to seek a 
stay of the unsealing process and fairly explain why a stay is appropriate. And by 
that time, there won’t be a way to “re-seal” material prematurely released to the 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page7 of 23

 
5 
public.2 Op.Br. 16. (distinguishing United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23 (2d Cir. 
1986)). 
The government argues that Ms. Maxwell can wait until after the criminal 
trial to challenge whether, for example, Judge Preska’s unsealing decisions produce 
unfair pretrial publicity in the criminal case. But a panel of this Court considering 
an appeal in the criminal case presided over by Judge Nathan won’t have any 
jurisdiction to review orders entered by Judge Preska in the civil case. The time for 
reviewing Judge Preska’s unsealing order in the civil case is right now in the appeal 
of Judge Preska’s order, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413. 
The government also argues that, in a post-trial appeal, Ms. Maxwell can 
challenge the government’s conduct in obtaining Ms. Maxwell’s deposition 
transcripts and the use of those transcripts as a basis for two perjury counts. 
 
2 This Court should accordingly reject the government’s argument that “[t]o 
the extent Maxwell still wishes to use materials she obtained through criminal 
discovery for other purposes after entry of final judgment in the criminal case, she 
can seek authorization from this Court to do so then.” Ans.Br. 17.  
Similarly, the government misunderstands the relief Ms. Maxwell seeks 
when it contends that “[i]f Maxwell complains that her inability to use criminal 
discovery materials in civil matters may result in premature unsealing . . . , she 
can . . . raise [that] claim[] before this Court on appeal after entry of final judgment 
in her criminal case.” Ans.Br. 17. A post-final-judgment appeal will do no good 
because there is no way to “re-seal” material already unsealed and no way to 
retroactively stay an unsealing process that is largely if not entirely complete. 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page8 of 23

 
6
Ans.Br. 18. But as Ms. Maxwell explained in her opening brief, if Judge Preska 
orders the deposition transcripts unsealed, the government will invoke Judge 
Preska’s order as a shield against its improper conduct. Op.Br. 27–28, 30. The 
government will argue that it would have inevitably discovered Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition transcripts or that any improper conduct on its part was ultimately 
harmless. Op.Br. 30. Conspicuously, the government in the answer brief never 
denies that it will make such an argument. Ans.Br. 18 & n.4. 
The government responds that if Ms. Maxwell “is concerned that unsealing 
will open up an inevitable discovery argument for the Government, she can explain 
to Judge Nathan when making a suppression motion how an unsealing decision 
would have been altered by revelation of criminal discovery materials to the 
unsealing court.” Ans.Br. 18. This is fanciful thinking.  
If this Court affirms Judge Preska’s decision unsealing the deposition 
material, Judge Nathan likely will not (cannot?) reject an inevitable discovery 
argument from the government. Judge Nathan is not going to second-guess Judge 
Preska’s decision to unseal the deposition material if this Court affirms its release. 
This, of course, explains why the government has not moved to intervene in Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.), to stay the unsealing process, or to oppose 
the unsealing of the deposition material. Because Judge Preska and the panel of this 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page9 of 23

 
7
Court reviewing Judge Preska’s decision deserve to know now 
 
, a post-trial appeal is insufficient. 
This Court, therefore, has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, because 
Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. 
See Will, 546 U.S. at 349.  
In its final argument, the government says Ms. Maxwell “fails to explain how 
the way the Government obtained the confidential criminal discovery materials at 
issue has any bearing on or in any way affects First Amendment principles 
governing unsealing decisions in a civil case.” Ans.Br. 19. The government also 
claims that Ms. Maxwell “is already able to share the essential facts she wishes to 
convey under Judge Nathan’s Order.” Ans.Br. 19. Neither contention has merit. 
The first contention is a retread of the government’s response to Ms. 
Maxwell’s motion to consolidate, in which the government professed not to 
understand the relationship between the two cases. Doc. 39, pp 19–21, ¶¶ 26–27. 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page10 of 23

 
8 
 And Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition testimony in the civil case provides the substantive basis for two of the 
six charges she faces. App. 27–29. 
 As explained in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, Doc. 60, her motion to 
consolidate, Doc. 17, and the reply in support, Doc. 54, 
 
 
For example, in balancing the qualified First Amendment presumption of access (a 
presumption that is significantly less as applied to the deposition material than the 
summary judgment material this Court released in Brown v. Maxwell), Judge Preska 
and this Court must evaluate countervailing considerations including, most 
prominently, Ms. Maxwell’s reliance on the civil protective order. Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, No. 20-2413, Doc. 40, pp 21–28. 
 
 Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys repeatedly used the existence of the 
civil protective order to deflect Ms. Maxwell’s arguments about her right to 
privacy, her right against self-incrimination, and her concern that Ms. Giuffre 
would use documents in the civil action to support a criminal investigation. Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, Doc. 111, p 20. Ms. Maxwell then did not invoke her Fifth 
Amendment right to remain silent and instead testified at two depositions. Id. 
 
 Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page11 of 23
1111 

 
9
repeatedly downplayed the risk of a criminal investigation 
 
 
 Ms. Maxwell’s reliance on the 
protective order, an unquestionably valid factor weighing against unsealing, is all 
the more apparent once it is evaluated in its full context. That context now 
includes: the grand jury investigation; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The information Ms. Maxwell wants to share with Judge Preska and this 
Court is also relevant to show how the government bypassed Martindell. While this 
Court (in either appeal) need not pass on the propriety of the government’s 
conduct, preserving Ms. Maxwell’s right to litigate that issue before Judge Nathan 
is essential to her due process right to a fair trial. U.S. CONST. amend. V. If the 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page12 of 23

 
10
deposition material is prematurely released, as the government so clearly desires, 
Ms. Maxwell’s ability to make the Martindell argument will be compromised.3 
Third, Ms. Maxwell intends to move Judge Preska to stay future unsealing 
pending the outcome of the criminal case. But she cannot fairly make her case to 
Judge Preska unless Judge Preska knows 
 
 Judge Preska and the panel 
of this Court deciding the unsealing appeal are the only relevant actors who don’t 
know the relevant facts.  
The government’s second contention—that Ms. Maxwell can already share 
the “basic facts” with Judge Preska—misunderstands what Ms. Maxwell seeks to 
share (under seal and not publicly) and what Judge Nathan’s order permits (not 
very much). According to the government, Ms. Maxwell is free to share the 
identity of “Court-1” and “Court-2” and  
the fact that the Government obtained an order from Court-1 
permitting the Recipient to comply with a subpoena for materials 
 
3 Surely due process does not contemplate a scenario in which Ms. Maxwell 
is never permitted to challenge 
 
. But that’s apparently the government’s position. Ms. Maxwell 
did not know of the 
 proceeding before 
, so she 
couldn’t argue against 
. Ms. Maxwell did not 
know when 
, so she couldn’t appeal. 
And if Judge Preska’s unsealing order goes into effect, the government will seek to 
deny Ms. Maxwell the right to challenge its conduct before Judge Nathan. 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page13 of 23

 
11 
covered by a protective order, that Court-2 subsequently denied 
similar relief in another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this 
information (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule 16 discovery in 
this criminal matter.” 
Ans.Br. 27 (quoting App. 101–02). If only it were so simple. 
What the government doesn’t acknowledge is that, under the protective 
order and Judge Nathan’s decision declining to modify it, Ms. Maxwell cannot: 
• Disclose who the “Recipient” is 
 
; 
• Disclose what material the government obtained 
 
; 
• Disclose that the bulk of the government’s criminal case against 
Ms. Maxwell 
 
 
 
 
; 
• Disclose why 
 (Court-2) declined the government’s 
 request 
 
; or 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page14 of 23

 
12
• Disclose why 
(Court-1) granted the government’s 
 request 
 
. 
The “basic facts” Ms. Maxwell is allowed to share thus do not include the 
“material facts.” 
*** 
The collateral order doctrine is, admittedly, the exception and not the rule. 
Its purpose is to avoid delay and piecemeal appeals.4 But it’s not as inflexible as the 
government suggests, and its application is not oblivious to reality. It is a practical 
doctrine that exists for those few cases in which a post-trial appeal is inadequate to 
the task and the issue for immediate appeal is separable from the merits. This 
appeal, novel as it is, falls within those parameters.5  
 
4 Although the government says it “remains to be seen” whether this appeal 
will delay the criminal case, it offers no specifics or even speculation about how 
such a delay might be occasioned. Ans.Br. 19 n.5. To be clear, this appeal has 
nothing to do with the merits of the government’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, 
and it will not delay the criminal trial. 
5 As for Ms. Maxwell’s alternative request that this Court exercise 
mandamus jurisdiction, the government’s brief denies that Judge Nathan abused 
her discretion but doesn’t otherwise contend that this Court may exercise 
mandamus jurisdiction. Ans.Br. 20–21. Because, as explained below, Judge Nathan 
abused her discretion, this Court should issue a writ of mandamus if it concludes 
that it lacks jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.

Argument 
Apart from obscuring the relief Ms. Maxwell actually seeks, the other major 
feature of the government’s brief is its confusion of the arguments Ms. Maxwell 
actually makes on the merits. And nothing is more illustrative of the government’s 
confusion than this fact: The answer brief doesn’t even cite this Court’s decision in 
Martindell. 
The closest the government comes to acknowledging Ms. Maxwell’s 
argument is to say this:  “To maintain the integrity of the grand jury investigation 
and in accordance with both Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) and its 
standard practice, the Government did not notify Maxwell or her counsel of the 
Subpoenas.” Ans.Br. 5. But standard practice doesn’t justify circumventing a 
thirty-year-old decision of this Court, which required notice to Ms. Maxwell. 
Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294; App. 368–69 
Moreover, nothing in Rule 6(e) relieved the government of its burden to 
comply with Martindell by seeking to intervene in the civil case or by otherwise 
giving Ms. Maxwell notice of the subpoena and an opportunity to move to quash. 
Rule 6(e)(2)(vi) says that “an attorney for the government” “must not disclose a 
matter occurring before the grand jury.” The 
 
 was not a “matter occurring before the grand jury.” And 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page16 of 23

 
14
nothing prohibited 
 from informing Judge Preska and Ms. Maxwell 
about the subpoena; Rule 6(e) does not apply to grand jury witnesses. United States 
v. Sells Eng’g, Inc., 463 U.S. 418, 425 (1983). 
Despite the government’s attempt (once again) to mischaracterize Ms. 
Maxwell’s argument,6 this Court need not in this case wade into the propriety of 
the government’s conduct. All Ms. Maxwell seeks is the preservation of her ability 
to challenge the government’s conduct before Judge Nathan. This Court should 
permit Ms. Maxwell a fair opportunity to persuade Judge Preska and the panel of 
this Court reviewing her order that the status quo should be preserved.  
The government again implies that because Ms. Maxwell consented to the 
protective order she can’t now complain that it should be modified. Ans.Br. 23–
24.7 The government points out that, at the time of her consent, Ms. Maxwell knew 
 
6 The government says that Ms. Maxwell’s brief “appears to be a thinly 
veiled attempt to have this Court weigh in on the Government’s investigative 
methods.” Ans.Br. 26. That is not so. All Ms. Maxwell seeks is the ability to fairly 
challenge before Judge Nathan the government’s “investigative methods.” As the 
government does not dispute, that challenge will be compromised unless the 
deposition material remains sealed. But Judge Preska and the panel of this Court 
reviewing Judge Preska don’t know that, and the government wants to keep it that 
way. 
7 Moreover, the purpose of the criminal protective order’s prohibition on 
using criminal discovery in a civil case is to prevent the introduction of new 
information in a civil case to gain an advantage. Ms. Maxwell’s requested 
—footnote cont’d on next page— 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page17 of 23

 
15
“the Government had charged her with perjury in connection with civil cases.” 
Ans.Br. 23 n.7. But knowing that the government had copies of her depositions is a 
far cry from knowing 
 
 Ms. Maxwell’s original consent to the 
criminal protective order is irrelevant to this appeal. 
The government next argues that Ms. Maxwell has not offered a “coherent 
explanation of how the criminal discovery materials could have any conceivable 
impact on the issues pending in civil litigation.” Ans.Br. 24. To the contrary, Ms. 
Maxwell has repeatedly explained why the criminal discovery is relevant to Judge 
Preska and the panel of this Court reviewing Judge Preska’s order. Op.Br. 26–33.  
In addition to the reasons identified above, This Brief, supra at 7–10, Judge 
Preska simply never had before her the full picture when deciding whether to 
unseal the deposition material. So Judge Preska never considered the government’s 
position that the sealed material should not be released because it might prejudice 
the ongoing investigation. Nor did she consider Judge Nathan’s view, embodied in 
 
modification of the criminal protective order is fully consistent with that purpose, 
because she seeks only: (1) to share relevant information with Judge Preska; (2) 
under seal; (3) 
; and (4) to facilitate Judge 
Preska in performing a non-merits task assigned to her by this Court. 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page18 of 23

the criminal protective order, that 
 should not be used except in 
the criminal case and therefore should not be released publicly.8  
This Court tasked Judge Preska with evaluating whether and to what extent 
the civil case filings should be unsealed considering the totality of the 
circumstances. Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 & n.13 (2d Cir. 2019). Judge 
Preska is performing this task ignorant of the fact that 
 
 
 Unless the criminal 
protective order is modified, Judge Preska will remain in the dark, and she will 
never be given the opportunity to consider the circumstances in their totality. 
  The government appears to have abandoned the argument it made to Judge 
Nathan that modifying the protective order threatens the secrecy of the ongoing 
grand jury investigation. Op.Br. 31–32. And for good reason. Ms. Maxwell has 
never sought to make public material the criminal protective order shields from 
disclosure. All she seeks is permission to share, under seal, information 
 
 
8 The government’s view that 
 should not be released, 
and Judge Nathan’s order to that effect, also lend support to Ms. Maxwell’s 
contention that the release of the deposition material by Judge Preska 
 
 will unfairly prejudice her right to a fair 
trial by an impartial jury. See U.S. CONST. amends. V, VI; Nixon v. Warner 
Commc’ns, 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978). 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page19 of 23

 Giuffre v. Maxwell but kept secret from Judge Preska and this 
Court.  
Finally, the government offers a halfhearted defense of its decision to 
intervene in Doe v. Indyke, No. 20-cv-00484 (S.D.N.Y.), while choosing to remain 
on the sidelines of Giuffre v. Maxwell. Ans.Br. 28–29 n.8. According to the 
government, there is no need to intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell because discovery 
was already completed while discovery in Doe v. Indyke was just beginning. But this 
distinction ignores the government’s position on the confidentiality of the criminal 
discovery material in this case. Again, 
 
 
 
  
In the criminal case, the government insists 
 
, so secret in fact 
that Ms. Maxwell must not be allowed to share their contents with Judge Preska or 
this Court, even under seal. But if that’s right, then the government should oppose 
unsealing any filings from Giuffre v. Maxwell 
 
 The government, of course, 
hasn’t done that, and its answer brief offers no explanation why. The reason, 
Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page20 of 23

 
18
though, is obvious: The government wants to shield itself from Ms. Maxwell’s 
forthcoming motion before Judge Nathan challenging its circumvention of 
Martindell. This Court should not prejudge the Martindell issue as the government 
seeks. 
Conclusion 
At bottom, when asked to justify why Judge Preska and this Court should 
remain in the dark, the government offers little more than this: because the 
protective order says so. But in the face of all the reasons why the relevant judicial 
decision makers should have all the relevant information, the government’s answer 
is not good enough. 
This Court should reverse the district court’s order denying Ms. Maxwell’s 
motion to modify the protective order.

United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Plaintiff-Appellee, 
—against— 
 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
 
 
ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, 20-CR-330 (AJN) 
 
 
Unopposed Motion for Leave to File Unredacted Reply Brief 
under Seal 
 
 
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell, through her attorneys Haddon, 
Morgan and Foreman, P.C., moves unopposed for leave to file her unredacted 
reply brief under seal. As grounds for this request, Ms. Maxwell states: 
This appeal addresses an order by Judge Nathan declining to modify a 
criminal protective order. A related case, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, 
Case 20-3061, Document 95, 10/08/2020, 2948488, Page2 of 5

addresses an order by Judge Preska unsealing certain deposition material. Ms. 
Maxwell has filed a motion to consolidate both appeals.  
The unredacted reply brief references material currently under seal and/or 
shielded by the criminal protective order.  
To comply with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell can file the 
unredacted version of the reply only under seal with this Court.  
In compliance with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell will 
publicly file on ECF a redacted copy of her reply brief. 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell conferred with the government regarding this 
motion. The government does not oppose this motion. 
For these reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests leave to file her 
unredacted reply brief under seal. 
October 8, 2020.

Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). 
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, 
ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the motion to consolidate is DENIED and the appeal is 
DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.  
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks interlocutory relief from a September 2, 2020 
denial of her motion to modify a protective order entered on July 30, 2020. In the alternative, she 
argues that this Court should issue a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to modify the 
protective order. She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413. Meanwhile, the Government moves this Court to dismiss the appeal for 
lack of jurisdiction and opposes Maxwell’s motion to consolidate on the grounds that the issues 
presented on appeal are both factually and legally distinct. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the 
underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.   
This Court has jurisdiction over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. 
“Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.” 
Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 324 (1940). The “final judgment rule requires that a party 
must ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits.” 
Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). “This 
insistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-
footed administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” Di Bella v. 
United States, 369 U.S. 121, 124 (1962) (citing Cobbledick, 309 U.S. at 324–26). The final judgment rule 
is therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 
U.S. 263, 265 (1982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and 
the imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2001) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
There is a “narrow” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from 
“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal 
system, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 867–
68 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Supreme Court has described the 
“conditions for collateral order appeal as stringent” in general, Digital Equip. Corp., 511 U.S. at 868 
(emphasis added), and, with respect to criminal cases, it has “interpreted the collateral order 
exception with the utmost strictness.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) 
(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). To fall within this limited category of 
appealable collateral orders, a decision must “(1) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2) 
resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively 
Case 20-3061, Document 104-1, 10/19/2020, 2955206, Page2 of 4

 
3 
 
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d 1, 5 (2d Cir. 2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  
Thus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that 
come within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail, 
motions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of 
antipsychotic medication. See Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003) (holding that an order 
permitting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see also 
Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from 
an order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to 
modify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See 
Mohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 107–08 (2009) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not 
immediately appealable absent a showing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment 
would imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)); S.E.C. v. Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d 159, 168 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that the 
Court lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of 
privilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that the Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal 
defendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”).  We decline to exercise jurisdiction 
where we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  
In the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the 
District Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the 
finality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power or a 
clear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). “[M]ere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a 
calculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the 
writ.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 850 (2d Cir. 1972). Here, Maxwell failed to 
demonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its power 
or abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.   
Finally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in 
Guiffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the 
denial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted, 
we deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this 
Court has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further 
relief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of showing the commonality of factual 
and legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. 1993). 
Here, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The 
criminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil 
Case 20-3061, Document 104-1, 10/19/2020, 2955206, Page3 of 4

 
4 
 
appeal concerns an unsealing order. Further, as the District Court correctly noted, Maxwell 
“provide[s] no coherent explanation” connecting the discovery materials at issue in the criminal case 
to the civil litigation.  
CONCLUSION 
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal 
and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED and the 
motion to consolidate is DENIED as moot. 
Any appeal in this criminal case shall be referred to another panel in the ordinary course.

writ.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 850 (2d Cir. 1972). Here, Maxwell failed to 
demonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its power 
or abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.   
Finally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in 
Guiffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the 
denial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted, 
we deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this 
Court has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further 
relief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of showing the commonality of factual 
and legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. 1993). 
Here, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The 
criminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil

appeal concerns an unsealing order. Further, as the District Court correctly noted, Maxwell 
“provide[s] no coherent explanation” connecting the discovery materials at issue in the criminal case 
to the civil litigation.  
CONCLUSION 
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal 
and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED and the 
motion to consolidate is DENIED as moot. 
Any appeal in this criminal case shall be referred to another panel in the ordinary course.

Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). 
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, 
ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the motion to consolidate is DENIED and the appeal is 
DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.  
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks interlocutory relief from a September 2, 2020 
denial of her motion to modify a protective order entered on July 30, 2020. In the alternative, she 
argues that this Court should issue a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to modify the 
protective order. She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413. Meanwhile, the Government moves this Court to dismiss the appeal for 
lack of jurisdiction and opposes Maxwell’s motion to consolidate on the grounds that the issues 
presented on appeal are both factually and legally distinct. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the 
underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.   
This Court has jurisdiction over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. 
“Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.” 
Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 324 (1940). The “final judgment rule requires that a party 
must ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits.” 
Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). “This 
insistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-
footed administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” Di Bella v. 
United States, 369 U.S. 121, 124 (1962) (citing Cobbledick, 309 U.S. at 324–26). The final judgment rule 
is therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 
U.S. 263, 265 (1982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and 
the imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2001) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
There is a “narrow” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from 
“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal 
system, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 867–
68 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Supreme Court has described the 
“conditions for collateral order appeal as stringent” in general, Digital Equip. Corp., 511 U.S. at 868 
(emphasis added), and, with respect to criminal cases, it has “interpreted the collateral order 
exception with the utmost strictness.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) 
(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). To fall within this limited category of 
appealable collateral orders, a decision must “(1) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2) 
resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively

unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d 1, 5 (2d Cir. 2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  
Thus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that 
come within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail, 
motions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of 
antipsychotic medication. See Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003) (holding that an order 
permitting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see also 
Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from 
an order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to 
modify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See 
Mohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 107–08 (2009) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not 
immediately appealable absent a showing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment 
would imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)); S.E.C. v. Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d 159, 168 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that the 
Court lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of 
privilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that the Court 
lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal 
defendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”).  We decline to exercise jurisdiction 
where we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  
In the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the 
District Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the 
finality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power or a 
clear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). “[M]ere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a 
calculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the 
writ.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 850 (2d Cir. 1972). Here, Maxwell failed to 
demonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its power 
or abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.   
Finally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in 
Guiffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the 
denial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted, 
we deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this 
Court has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further 
relief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of showing the commonality of factual 
and legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. 1993). 
Here, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The 
criminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil

appeal concerns an unsealing order. Further, as the District Court correctly noted, Maxwell 
“provide[s] no coherent explanation” connecting the discovery materials at issue in the criminal case 
to the civil litigation.  
CONCLUSION 
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal 
and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED and the 
motion to consolidate is DENIED as moot. 
Any appeal in this criminal case shall be referred to another panel in the ordinary course.
