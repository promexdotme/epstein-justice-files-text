Defendant.  
 
______________________________/ 
 
COMPLAINT 
 
 
Plaintiff, VE, by and through her undersigned counsel, for her claims against 
Defendants, alleges as follows: 
1. 
 The controversy in this cause of action exceeds the sum or value of 
$75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of different States.  
Therefore, jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. section 1332.  
2. 
Plaintiff files this Complaint under a pseudonym in order to protect her 
identity because this Complaint makes allegations of a sensitive sexual nature the 
disclosure of which, in association with her name, would cause further harm to her. 
3. 
Plaintiff is currently a resident of and domiciled in the state of Florida.   
4. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein travelled 
between and stayed regularly in multiple residences, including in New York, New 
York (within the Southern District of New York) and the United States Virgin

Islands.  He was a citizen of the United States and a resident of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.  
5. 
At all times material to this cause of action Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male born in 1953, who died on August 10, 2019.  
6. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation was a domestic business corporation conducting business in New York, 
with its principal place of business located at 575 Lexington Avenue, Fourth Floor, 
New York, NY 10022.   
7. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant Financial Trust Company, Inc. 
was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in New York.   
8. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant NES, LLC, was and is a 
domestic limited liability company registered in and conducting business in New 
York.   
9. 
Corporate Defendants NES, LLC; Financial Trust Company, Inc; Nine 
East 71st Street, referred to as “Defendants,” each performed substantial business in 
New York. 
10. 
Plaintiff intends to amend this complaint to add or substitute additional 
parties as discovery reveals the identities of other negligent corporate or individual 
actors.  In that regard, through information and belief, the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 2 of 26

has not been properly established although if and when it is, Plaintiff intends to 
amend to add the Estate as a party.   
11. 
Jeffrey Epstein was an officer, director, or employee of many corporate 
entities registered in various states throughout the United States, any one of which 
may also bear legal responsibility for the crimes he committed against young 
females, including minors such as Plaintiff.   
12. 
Additionally, individuals who worked at the residences where he 
committed sexual violations, as well as others who assisted him in committing such 
violations, were employed through, or worked for, numerous other corporate entities 
whose negligence likely caused or contributed to the sexual violations that caused 
harm to Plaintiff.   
13. 
 The complete universe of those individuals and companies whose 
negligence contributed to the crimes committed by Epstein are currently unknown.  
14. 
As Plaintiff learns through discovery the identities of additional 
individual or corporate entities and the manner in which those others caused or 
contributed to causing harm to Plaintiff through negligence, Plaintiff intends to 
amend to add those parties as well.  Should discovery reveal that any of the currently 
named Defendants are not the proper identity of the Companies identified as current 
Defendants, substitution of parties shall be requested to ensure accuracy and 
correctness of pleading.

A substantial part of the acts, events, and omissions giving rise to this 
cause of action occurred in the Southern District of New York; venue is proper in 
this District.  28 U.S.C. section 1391(b)(2). 
16. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein and 
Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat her in a non-negligent manner and not 
to commit or conspire to commit intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts 
against her, including any acts that would cause Plaintiff to be harmed through 
conduct committed against her in violation of New York Penal Law section 214-G, 
New York Penal Law section 130.20; or New York Penal Law 130.66; or New York 
Penal Law 130.67; or New York Penal Law 130.52. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
17. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein was an adult 
male over 45 years old.  Epstein was tremendously wealthy, widely recognized as a 
billionaire, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal 
sexual crimes in violation of federal and state statutes and to employ and conspire 
with other individuals and corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes 
or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
18. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his 
employees; to the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 4 of 26

5 
direction; to the victims procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to 
advance and carry out and conceal his crimes and torts.   
19. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he 
regularly traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-
31H with tail number N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-
1159B with tail number N909JE).

21. 
Jeffrey Epstein was otherwise affiliated with the corporations that 
owned or controlled each of the real property listed in the preceding paragraph. 
22. 
The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct 
while at his townhouse in New York and concern the various corporate entities 
which provided the opportunity for his illicit conduct to occur and remain concealed 
for years.   
23. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females as young 
as 14 years old.   
24. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor 
children, and took pleasure corrupting vulnerable young females, including minor 
children, into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
25. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees 
and associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the 
purpose of harming teenage girls through sexual exploitation. 
26. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence 
that he got pleasure out of corrupting vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
27. 
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern 
District of New York filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment inclusive of One Count 
of Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part due to 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 6 of 26

7 
Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 
East 71st Street.   
28. 
On July 8, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested pursuant to the 
aforementioned Indictment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.    
29. 
The Indictment stated in part, and Plaintiff herein adopts as true, that 
“from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey 
Epstein, the defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New York (the “New York 
Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the “Palm Beach Residence”) to 
engage in sex acts with him, after which the victims were given hundreds of dollars 
in cash.”  Criminal Indictment at 1. 
30. 
“Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, 
Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly 
abused by EPSTEIN.  In this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm 
Beach.”  Criminal Indictment at 1-2.   
31. 
“The victims described herein were as young as 14 years old at the time 
they were abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation.  Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 7 of 26

8 
many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18, including because, in some 
instances, minor victims expressly told him their age.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.  
32. 
“In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple 
states to sexually abuse and exploit, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, … worked and conspired 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, 
among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with 
EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence.”  Criminal 
Indictment at 2.   
33. 
The indictment further explained, and Plaintiff adopts and alleges, that, 
“[v]ictims were initially recruited to provide ‘massages’ to Epstein, which would be 
performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.   
34. 
“Between at least in or about 2002 and in or about 2005, Epstein abused 
numerous minor victims at the New York Residence by causing these victims to be 
recruited to engage in paid sex acts with him.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.     
35. 
Defendants enabled Jeffrey Epstein to receive near daily massages from 
young females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than 
receive regular body massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing the young 
females in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 8 of 26

9 
36. 
Additionally, employees of the various Defendant corporations 
performed actions or inactions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in 
danger of being sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his 
sexually abusive acts.   
37. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females.  The nature of 
the Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking venture and enterprise enabled victims 
themselves to elevate their status to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an 
elevation only made possible through the negligence of Defendants.   
38. 
Recruiters were taught by employees of Defendants to inform targeted 
victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, resources, and 
influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance their 
careers and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body massages 
in order to avail receive his assistance and influence.   
39. 
The collaboration from Defendants and the many employees fulfilled 
Epstein’s compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, 
psychological, financial, and related vulnerabilities. Defendants’ tactics included 
promising the victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission 
into educational institutions, educational tuition, protection, and other things of 
value in exchange for sex and concealment of Jeffrey Epstein’s actions.    
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 9 of 26

10 
40. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females, 
dated back to at least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased 
substantially with the necessary assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ 
employees.   
41. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, 
and with help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, 
recruited or procured dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, 
for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual gratification.  
42. 
Jeffrey Epstein, and consequently Defendants, specifically targeted 
underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or economically disadvantaged young 
females to sexually molest and abuse.   
43. 
Additionally, Defendants through employees, informed young females 
that Jeffrey Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and could either advance or 
destroy the career or education of any young female brought to provide Jeffrey 
Epstein a massage, depending on her degree of cooperation.   
VE 
44. 
Minor victim VE was subjected to the types of illegal sexual acts 
detailed in the Criminal Indictment filed against Jeffrey Epstein by the Southern 
District of New York.

11 
45. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed abhorrent acts of sexual abuse against 
Plaintiff in 2001 when she was only sixteen years old. 
46. 
In or about 2001, Plaintiff was recruited by another minor child to go 
to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, New York to provide him with a 
“massage.”  
47. 
The minor child who recruited Plaintiff (“Plaintiff’s friend”) informed 
Plaintiff that she would be paid $300 to provide a massage to a man in Manhattan.  
48. 
Plaintiff was a minor female with no experience or training in massage.  
49. 
She was recruited under the false pretense that she would be providing 
a legitimate body massage at the mansion owned or controlled by Defendant, Nine 
East.  
50. 
In or about the Fall of 2001, Plaintiff’s friend brought Plaintiff to 
Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide him with a massage.  
51. 
Upon arrival to the mansion, the two minor children were escorted 
inside by an employee of Defendant NES, LLC and taken to Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room.   
52. 
Plaintiff’s friend entered the massage room and left Plaintiff outside the 
door.   
53. 
Moments later, Plaintiff’s friend exited the room and instructed 
Plaintiff to enter the room alone.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 11 of 26

12 
54. 
Plaintiff walked into the dark room which contained a massage table, 
various massage oils, and numerous photographs of nude girls.  
55. 
Unsure of what to expect, Plaintiff waited for the man to arrive for his 
massage.   
56. 
Jeffrey Epstein entered the room and immediately removed his clothing 
before positioning himself on the massage table. 
57. 
Jeffrey Epstein then provided Plaintiff with instruction on how to 
massage his body.   
58. 
Jeffrey Epstein quickly turned the massage into a sexual encounter with 
the then sixteen-year-old Plaintiff.  
59. 
During the sexual encounter, Plaintiff told Jeffrey Epstein that she did 
not feel comfortable.  Jeffrey Epstein ignored her and continued to engage in the 
improper and illegal sexual contact until he was finished.    
60. 
The sexual encounter ended when Jeffrey Epstein masturbated to 
climax. 
61. 
Plaintiff was paid $300 cash before being escorted out of his mansion, 
all with assistance from Defendants; this payment was made to induce Plaintiff to 
conceal the activities of Epstein and to entice her to return.   
62. 
Plaintiff observed the opulence of the mansion owned by Defendant, 
Nine East, and the organization of Defendant, NES, Inc., which collectively 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 12 of 26

13 
facilitated her further cooperation with Jeffrey Epstein, culminating in New York 
Penal Law Section 130 crimes being committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein. 
63. 
Within days, Plaintiff returned to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion wherein 
she endured yet another sexual assault, this time more severe.   
64. 
Plaintiff was taken by elevator to the floor where Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage room was located.   
65. 
Similar to the first time, Jeffrey Epstein appeared wearing only a towel 
and laid face down on the massage table.  Within minutes, he again turned the 
massage into a sexual encounter against the 16-year-old plaintiff.  He instructed her 
to take her clothes off this time.   
66. 
During the second encounter, in addition to harmful, forcible, physical 
touching and sexual exploitation of Plaintiff, Jeffrey Epstein forcibly used a sex toy 
on Plaintiff, forcibly pressing it onto and in Plaintiff’s vagina.   
67. 
Jeffrey Epstein then commanded Plaintiff to straddle him.  Knowing 
that she had no way out of the Mansion, she complied with Jeffrey Epstein’s orders.   
68. 
Jeffrey Epstein moved plaintiff’s panties aside and attempted to insert 
his penis into her vagina, briefly penetrating her, while Plaintiff was resisting.   
69. 
During this encounter, Epstein digitally penetrated Plaintiff. The 
encounter ended with Jeffrey Epstein masturbating to climax.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 13 of 26

14 
70. 
Throughout the duration of the sexual encounter, Plaintiff found herself 
trapped in Jeffrey Epstein’s large mansion under the impression that there was no 
feasible or safe means of escape. 
71. 
All sexual acts were performed by Jeffrey Epstein intentionally and for 
no legitimate purpose and for his own gratification when Plaintiff was a minor child 
less than seventeen years of age.  
72. 
The intentional acts of Jeffrey Epstein against Plaintiff constitute a 
sexual offense as defined in New York Penal Law § 130.  
73. 
Pursuant to New York Penal Law § 130.05, a person is deemed 
incapable of consent when she is less than seventeen years old.   
74. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed sexual misconduct against Plaintiff as 
defined in §130.20 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein 
engaged in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff without Plaintiff’s consent.   
75. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed a forcible touching against Plaintiff as 
defined in §130.52 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as Jeffrey Epstein, 
intentionally and for no legitimate purpose, engaged the forcible sexual touching of 
Plaintiff for the purpose of degrading or abusing her or for the purpose of gratifying 
his sexual desire.  
76. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed an aggravated sexual abuse in the third 
degree against her as defined in §130.66 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 14 of 26

15 
Jeffrey Epstein inserted a foreign object into the vagina of Plaintiff by forcible 
compulsion.     
77. 
Jeffrey Epstein committed an aggravated sexual abuse in the second 
degree against her as defined in §130.67 of the New York Penal Law, inasmuch as 
Jeffrey Epstein caused physical injury to Plaintiff when he inserted a finger into the 
vagina of Plaintiff by forcible compulsion.    
COUNT I 
NEGLIGENT SECURITY AGAINST  
NINE EAST 71st STREET, CORPORATION 
 
78. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 77 above. 
79. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation (hereinafter “Nine East”), was the lawful owner of the property located 
at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, 10021. 
80. 
Defendant, Nine East, acquired title to the property on September 6, 
1989 and retained such title until the property was transferred to Maple, Inc. on 
December 11, 2011.  
81. 
At all such times, Defendant Nine East maintained legal control over 
the subject premises.  
82. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a regular habitant of Defendant Nine East and in 
fact resided at the premises when he was present in New York.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 15 of 26

16 
83. 
Defendant knew or should have known when Defendant was in the 
home owned by Defendant Nine East when Epstein had young females, including 
minor females such as Plaintiff.   
84. 
When Plaintiff was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein in 2001, 
Defendant, Nine East, as the owner of the property where all of the sexual abuse 
occurred, had a non-delegable duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe 
condition.  
85. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty additionally included the duty to take 
precautions to protect guests, visitors, or invitees from foreseeable harm, including 
foreseeable criminal conduct.  
86. 
Defendant’s non-delegable duty further included the duty to take 
reasonable precautionary measures to minimize the risk of criminal acts upon 
visitors.  
87. 
Most important, Defendant had a duty to take protective measures when 
it could be shown that the company possessing, owning, or controlling the property, 
knew or had reason to know from past experience that there was a likelihood of 
conduct that would endanger a visitor.   
88. 
To establish foreseeability, the criminal conduct at issue must be 
reasonably predictable based on the prior occurrence of the same or similar criminal 
activity at a location sufficiently proximate to the subject location. 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 16 of 26

17 
89. 
No conduct becomes more foreseeable or predictable than the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein, in which he engaged regularly, if not daily, when he was 
in Defendant’s property.  
90. 
Nearly every day that Jeffery Epstein was on or in the property of 
Defendant Nine East, he was engaging in criminal sexual behavior in violation of 
New York Penal Code Section 130.  
91. 
Defendant knew or should have known of Jeffrey Epstein’s propensity 
for sexually abusing minor children, including regularly on the premises.  
92. 
Defendant knew of should have known from past experience that there 
was a high likelihood that Jeffrey Epstein would engage in foreseeable criminal 
conduct that was likely to seriously endanger or injure a visitor, including Plaintiff.  
93. 
Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff by failing to take even minimal 
safety precautions to protect against the predictable criminal acts of Jeffrey Epstein, 
which were reasonably predictable and foreseeable to occur on the property.  
94. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
95. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, the Plaintiff has 
in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 17 of 26

18 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Nine East 71st Street, 
Corporation for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT II 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST 
FINANCIAL TRUST COMPANY, INCORPORATED 
 
96. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 77 above. 
97. 
At all times material hereto, Financial Trust Company, Inc. (hereinafter 
“Financial Trust”) was a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation conducting business in 
New York.   
98. 
At all times material hereto, Defendant, Financial Trust, employed 
Jeffrey Epstein.  
99. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, had a duty to exercise reasonable care to 
refrain from retaining in its employ a person with known dangerous propensities in 
a position that would present a foreseeable risk of harm to others.   
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 18 of 26

19 
100. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to satisfy the personal needs 
of Jeffrey Epstein, which included daily massages which Epstein requires to be 
sexual in nature.   
101. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s requirement that he receive regular massages from 
untrained young females caused Defendant and its employees to knowingly turn a 
blind eye to the dangerous sexual addictive propensities of Jeffrey Epstein, despite 
knowledge that he would cause harm to many young females including Plaintiff, in 
order to retain its most valuable employee—Jeffrey Epstein.  
102. 
Defendant Financial Trust operated in part to further Jeffrey Epstein’s 
goal to obtain, recruit, and procure young females for the purposes of providing 
sexually explicit massages to Jeffrey Epstein.  
103. 
During the course and scope of his employment for Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein did fulfill the corporate objective of receiving sexual massages procured for 
him by employees of Defendant.  
104. 
Jeffrey Epstein was notorious for converting each massage into a 
sexually exploitive activity in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130, a fact 
which was known or should have been known in the exercise of reasonable care by 
Defendant.  
105. 
Even though Defendant, Financial Trust, knew of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
propensity for the sort of behavior that caused Plaintiff’s harm and Jeffrey Epstein’s 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 19 of 26

20 
constant engagement in this type of criminal behavior during the course and scope 
of his employment, Defendant retained Jeffrey Epstein and failed to properly 
supervise him.  
106. 
Jeffrey Epstein did not have a set work schedule or office but instead 
conducted business on behalf of the corporation from various locations all over the 
world.   
107. 
While conducting said business, Jeffrey Epstein was frequently using 
corporate finances in furtherance of his sexually explicit behavior.   
108. 
Upon information and belief, at times other employees of the Defendant 
corporation were coordinating these sexually explicit massages for Epstein to engage 
in during business hours, while he was within the course and scope of his 
employment for Defendant.  
109. 
In fact, while Jeffrey Epstein was conducting business telephone calls 
or authorizing company actions on behalf of Defendant, Financial Trust, he would 
frequently be receiving a sexually explicit massage.   
110. 
In certain circumstances, sexually explicit massages provided by young 
women, oftentimes minor children, who were untrained in the art of massage, were 
coordinated by another employee of Defendant who knew or should have known 
that the massage was being conducted by an underage girl for the exclusive purpose 
of committing sexual crimes against her.

111. 
Jeffrey Epstein engaged in this type of sexually abusive behavior on a 
daily basis to the extent that engaging in sexual massages became the most regular 
activity that he engaged in while in the course and scope of his employment.  
112. 
Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual routine of recruiting and engaging in sexually 
explicit massages began many years before the formation of Defendant and was not 
a lifestyle unknown to Defendant, Financial Trust.  
113. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care 
should have known that Jeffrey Epstein was potentially dangerous, had engaged in 
a pattern of criminal sexual behavior against young females, including minors, for 
years prior to the formation of Defendant Financial Trust, and that he was not going 
to cease committing criminal sexual acts.   
114. 
Jeffrey Epstein was retained with knowledge of the propensity of this 
sort of behavior.   
115. 
Defendant, Financial Trust, retained Jeffrey Epstein with knowledge 
that he would in fact injure others, such as Plaintiff, during the course and scope of 
his employment.  
116. 
Despite such knowledge, Financial Trust knowingly placed Jeffrey 
Epstein in a position to cause foreseeable harm, which could have been prevented 
had Defendant taken reasonable care in making decisions regarding the retention and 
supervision of Jeffrey Epstein.

22 
117. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
118. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. for compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive 
damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  
Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury. 
COUNT III 
NEGLIGENCE AGAINST NES, LLC 
 
119. 
The Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 77 above. 
120. 
It is believed that each employee of Defendant, NES, operated at the 
direction of Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 22 of 26

23 
121. 
Upon information and belief, the primary responsibility of each 
employee of Defendant, NES, LLC (“NES”) was to fulfill the needs or requests of 
Jeffrey Epstein; more particularly, his daily massage schedule.  
122. 
Upon information and belief, the employees of Defendant, NES, were 
compensated to primarily, if not exclusively, procure or maintain each young female 
masseuse, or to assist, knowingly or unknowingly, in the concealment of any 
misconduct committed against each masseuse.  
123. 
Upon information and belief, the employment responsibilities of the 
various employees of Defendant, NES, included but were not limited to: 1) recruiting 
young females, including minor children such as Plaintiff, to provide massages, 2) 
creating Jeffrey Epstein’s massage schedule, 3) maintaining Jeffrey Epstein’s 
massage schedule, 4) escorting various young females into the massage room at the 
New York mansion owned by Defendant Nine East, 5) maintaining contact with the 
various young females who were recruited to the New York mansion for the 
purposes of providing Jeffrey Epstein with a massage, 6) providing compensation to 
each young masseuse upon the completion of her engagement with Jeffrey Epstein, 
7) providing meals and food and other services to the young females in order to 
provide an air of legitimacy to the functions of the corporation, 8) providing 
hospitality services to the young females in order to provide an air of legitimacy to 
the functions of the corporation, 9) providing educational services, 10) providing 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 23 of 26

24 
medical services, 11) providing transportation services, 12) providing housing 
services, 13) providing various other enticements to ensure the continued 
cooperation of the various young female masseuse with Defendant NES’s corporate 
objective, 14) encouraging individuals, including the females who were recruited to 
the house to provide a massage to recruit other young females to engage in the same 
activity for Jeffrey Epstein, and 15) coordinating together and with Jeffrey Epstein 
to convey a powerful and legitimate enterprise system capable of gaining 
cooperation from young females recruited for massage, often minors such as 
Plaintiff.  
124. 
In fulfilling their employment responsibilities, each employee 
voluntarily assumed a duty with respect to each young female recruited to massage 
Jeffrey Epstein, including Plaintiff.  
125. 
To fulfill said duty, each employee was required to perform their 
assumed duty carefully without omitting to do what an ordinarily prudent person 
would do in accomplishing the task.  
126. 
The young females being recruited to engage in massages for Jeffrey 
Epstein were inexperienced in the art of massage, a fact that was known or should 
have been known to Defendant NES and its employees in the exercise of reasonable 
care.  
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 24 of 26

25 
127. 
Plaintiff relied on Defendant NES’s voluntary assumption of a duty as 
well as the voluntary assumption of each individual employee to act with reasonable 
care towards her.   
128. 
In the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant and its employees further 
knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of Jeffrey Epstein and the 
proximate harm that would be caused by his likely sexual misconduct and various 
violations of New York Penal Law Section 130.  
129. 
The failure of Defendant NES and each of its respective employees to 
act in the same manner as an ordinarily prudent person, placed Plaintiff in a more 
vulnerable position than if Defendant and its employees had not assumed the 
obligation to treat her with reasonable care.   
130. 
In breaching its Duty, NES launched a force or instrument of harm 
directed toward Plaintiff.  In doing so, Defendant, NES, enhanced the risk Plaintiff 
faced and caused her to forego any opportunity she may otherwise have had to avoid 
the risk inherent with being in a room alone with Jeffrey Epstein to perform a 
massage as an untrained minor child.  
131. 
Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the sexual offenses 
committed against Plaintiff in violation of Article 130 of the NY Penal Law. 
132. 
As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff 
has in the past suffered and in the future will continue to suffer physical injury, pain, 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 1     Filed 08/14/19     Page 25 of 26

26 
emotional 
distress, 
psychological 
trauma, 
mental 
anguish, 
humiliation, 
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and a 
loss of her capacity to enjoy life, as well as other damages.  Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical 
and psychological expenses.  These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff 
will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against NES, Inc, for 
compensatory and general damages, attorney’s fees, punitive damages and such 
other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  Plaintiff hereby demands 
trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.
