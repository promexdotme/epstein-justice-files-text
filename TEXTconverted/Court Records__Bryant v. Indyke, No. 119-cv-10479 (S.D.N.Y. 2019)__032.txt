Re: 
Juliette Bryant v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10479-ALC-DCF 
 
 
 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We submit on behalf of Plaintiff Juliette Bryant this reply in further support of her letter 
motion for a conference to address Defendants’ complete failure to participate in discovery to date 
(ECF No. 27), and in response to Defendants’ letter, filed on May 8, 2020 (ECF No. 28).  As set 
forth in Plaintiff’s opening letter, Defendants refuse to produce documents concerning Jeffrey 
Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy.  Instead, they offer to produce only documents that directly 
mention Plaintiff’s name, and documents only from limited time periods surrounding the specific 
dates on which she was abused.  ECF No. 27.  Defendants also failed to respond to any of Plaintiff’s 
Rule 33 interrogatories.  Defendants’ opposition admittedly offers no “response to the substantive 
issues,” yet asks the Court to deny Plaintiff’s request for a conference because it would somehow 
be “an unnecessary waste of the Court’s time.”  ECF No. 28 at 1.  The Court should reject 
Defendants’ transparent delay tactic and order the Defendants to address their discovery 
deficiencies immediately.  
Defendants’ only basis for arguing that a conference would be “premature” is that, on April 
30, they promised to serve amended responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories by the end of last week.  
But not only did Defendants fail to serve amended interrogatory responses last week (despite 
committing to do so), they have never even offered to amend their responses to Plaintiff’s Rule 34 
requests for production.  Defendants also made clear at a meet and confer held on Tuesday, May 
5, that they would not be changing their positions on the threshold disputes identified in Plaintiff’s 
letter.  These disputes, which the parties have already conferred over for hours, are therefore ripe 
for the Court’s review. 
Contrary to Defendants’ suggestion, Plaintiff has complied with her obligations to meet 
and confer in good faith.  She has also already produced hundreds of documents spanning over 
10,000 pages.  Instead, it is Defendants’ obstructionist conduct that requires immediate Court 
intervention.  Because this case was filed six months ago and the Court’s Rule 16 conference took 
place back in February, Defendants’ failure to produce a single document or meaningfully respond 
to discovery requests can only be viewed as an intentional effort to delay discovery.  As just one 
example, Defendants claim that they “expect” to be able to “supplement” their interrogatory 
responses by May 13.  But their initial responses, which are attached as exhibits to Plaintiff’s

opening letter, speak for themselves, and make clear that Defendants have not undertaken 
reasonable efforts to comply with their discovery obligations or meet Court-ordered deadlines in 
good faith.  Where, as here, Defendants (i) refused to answer interrogatories such as “Identify all 
email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf”; (ii) failed to 
provide signatures, pursuant to Rule 33(b)(5), indicating that counsel even discussed the 
interrogatories with their clients before serving their responses; and (iii) did not send a single 
attorney involved in the drafting of their objections to the parties’ April 27 meet and confer, leaving 
Defendants unable to explain how their responses were crafted or even articulate what they meant; 
it is clear that Defendants are attempting to game the process to maximize delay.  Plaintiff’s 
decision to curtail these dilatory tactics therefore does not fall within what the Court described as 
a “pet peeve” at the February 11, 2020, conference.                              
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her request for a conference to address 
these issues. 
  
Respectfully submitted,
