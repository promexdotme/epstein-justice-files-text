COURT CLERK 
1At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences 
concerning the proposed compensation program. which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including 
claimants' counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that "(b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the support of claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining 
impediments have been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol."' they and the Attorney 
General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts 
owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program's active operations, including payment of compensation 
determinations to eligible claimants. Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program and 
Presentation of Program Protocol, at 6, June I. 2020.
