Doe 101 v. Epstein

Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009 
Page 4 of 9 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("MR EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
attorneys responds to the Plaintiffs' Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 ("Plaintiffs") 
Motion for a No Contact Order [DE 113] and states: 
I. 
Plaintiffs' Motion was completely unnecessary and a waste of attorney time and 
judicial resources. Plaintiffs' motion was filed to cast a false light on Mr. Epstein and his 
attorneys, and to draw attention away from the fact that many of the alleged "victims" on the 
referenced "list" were or are admitted prostitutes, dancers at strip clubs (Platinum Gold, Cheetah, 
Diamond Dolls, T's Lounge, Flashdance, etc.) or have criminal records or warrants for their 
arrests, to reference only a few issues about them. 
2. 
Plaintiffs seek an advisory opinion on an issue which does not exist. 
Neither 
Mr. Epstein nor his attorneys have initiated any contact, direct or indirect, with any alleged 
"victims", nor does Plaintiffs' counsel or any alleged person by way of affidavit alleged any type 
of contact, direct or indirect. The undersigned's May 21, 2009 (Exhibit 1 hereto) letter could 
not have been clearer as to the position of Mr. Epstein and his attorneys, i.e. "To my knowledge, 
neither Mr. Epstein nor any attorney or agent of those attorneys who represent Mr. Epstein, have 
contacted or attempted to contact your clients. Given that it is not Mr. Epstein's intention to 
have any direct contact with your clients, it is unnecessary to respond point by point to any 
statements attributed to my co-counsel." To the extent it was not clear in the undersigned's 
letter, neither Mr. Epstein nor his attorneys, nor their agents intend to have any direct or indirect 
contact with Plaintiffs counsels' clients. What else is there to say? 
3. 
Is Plaintiffs' counsel suggesting that Mr. Epstein cannot even be at the 
depositions of his clients as parties or witnesses? That certainly will be direct 'eye' contact at a 

Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 16-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 5 of 13
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 127 
Doe 101 v. Epstein 
Page 5 
Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009 
Page 5 of 9 
minimum. If that is Plaintiffs' position then Jane Doe 101 and 102, and any other matters where 
Plaintiffs' finn's clients are involved, should be stayed until expiration of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement, otherwise Mr. Epstein will be denied his due process right of any civil party to be 
present at opposing party's deposition. 
4. 
Rather than to mislead the court by providing a substantially redacted copy of the 
undersigned's May 18, 2009 letter, a full copy of the letter redacting only the client's full name 
is attached as Exhibit 2. The letter is important in that the Defendant and his attorneys recognize 
that no contact included not serving his client with a deposition subpoena through a process 
server, i.e. potentially an "agent" by serving her attorney. As this court will note from paragraph 
2 of Exhibit 1, a very cautious approach was taken by Defendant and his attorneys, in stating 
"However, based on the position that you, Bob, have taken, I am providing/serving you with the 
subpoena for L.S.P. 's deposition on June 11." 
5. 
Plaintiffs' counsel further tries to obfuscate Defendant's position by redacting the 
last paragraph of the May 18, 2009 letter, which states "Finally as I also indicated in our 
telephone conversation, your client contacted Jack Goldberger's [one of Mr. Epstein's attorneys] 
office last week suggesting that Jack was holding up the settlement. He did not speak with her. I 
don't know where Ms. P got that idea." 
Plaintiffs' counsel should be more concerned about 
controlling their own clients. 
6. 
Rather than the Plaintiffs filing this needless, unwarranted and excessive motion 
where they take another shot at Mr. Epstein so they can remind the court of their alleged 
damages, maybe, they should focus more on the background of their own clients, including the 
individual referenced in the May 18, 2009 letter.

Doe 101 v. Epstein 
Page6 
7. 
Finally, Mr. Epstein pled guilty to one count of felony solicitation (which was not 
related to a minor), under §796.07(2)(f), F.S. and one count of procuring a minor for prostitution 
under §796.03 F. S. 
Plaintiffs' reference to both counts being related to "minors" is again 
misleading and incorrect. 
8. 
At the time of the state court plea on June 30, 2008, neither Defendant nor his 
counsel nor the state attorney's office had seen the "secret" list of alleged victims, i.e. Mr. 
Epstein was forced to agree to a list of individuals that the USAO refused to provide pre-plea. 
The list was not provided to Mr. Epstein's attorney until after the plea and Mr. Epstein was in 
jail. With the parties to the plea completely unaware who would be on the list, how then could 
the state plea be construed as a limitless no contact order. Mr. Epstein is doing more than the 
law requires. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, Mr. Epstein, requests this court deny the motion as premature 
and unnecessary based on the current state of the facts.

As I advised you yesterday, Jam responding to your April 17, 2009 lettar. As I 
stated in my e~mall, I think your request ls unnecessary. Despite what Roy may have 
said to you, my client has had no contact with any of your clients. To my knowledge, 
the only one who has ubreached" any agreement regarding contact Is your own client, 
II 
ii l who, as I advised you In a letter last week, contacted Jack Goldberger's 
office. looking for her settlement check. Mr. Goldberger. of course, did not speak with 
her .. 
Lawyers who represent Mr. Epstein are well familiar with the Rules of 
Professional Conduct, including Rule 4-4.2. At the same time, l am certain you are 
equally famlllar with that Rule. 
The Comment provides "Parties to a matter may 
communicate directly with each other ... ". 
• 
To my knowledge, neither Mr. Epstein nor any attorney or agent of those 
attorneys who represent Mr. Epstein, have contacted or attempted to contact your 
clients. Given that rt fs not Mr. Epstein's Intention to have direct contact with your 
clients, It is unnecessary to respond point by point to statements attributed to my co-
counsel.

I am enclosing the settlement check made payable to your firm and your client, 
Ms. Patrick, In the amount of $50,000.00. Upon clearance of the funds, forward the 
original release to me. 
Additionally, Bob, you wrote a letter on April 17, 2009 stating your position 
regarding "No Contact'' with any of your firm's clients based on your interpretation· of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement I do not concede that your position is correct nor that the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement prevents some forms of contact with your clients. 
However, based on the position that you, Bob, have taken, I am providing/serving you 
with the subpoena for L-S• P-s deposition on June 11. 
If that date and time does not work for you, please let me know and we wlll re-
coordinate a date· within a reasonable time frame. 
As I advised you in our conversation today, May 18, 2009, there is a No-Bond 
Warrant for Ms. P ... 
's arrest. Apparently your client was arrested In March of this 
year for one count of battery and two counts of domestic violence based upon the Palm 
Beach County Sheriff's office booking records. She apparently violated her SOR, and 
therefore a Warrant is outstanding. 
While I have an obligation to provide you our firm's check made payable to your 
firm and Ms. Pilll, we are specifically opposed to the disbursement of any funds to 
her which would in any way suggest that Mr. Epstein or his attorneys are aiding a 
fugitive. Because there is a Warrant for her arrest and she ls a fugitive, disbursement of 
any funds to her maybe considered by the Palm Beach Sheriff's office to be uaiding a

fugitive". With the funds now under your control, you must make your own decision on 
disbursement. 
Finally as I also indicated In our telephone conversation, your client contacted 
Jack Goldberger's office last week suggesting that Jack was holding up the settlement. 
He did not speak with her. I don't know where Ms. P .. 
got that idea.
