UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
NO. 09-80469-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON
JANE DOE II,
Plaintiff,
v.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN and
SARAH KELLEN,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/
ORDER SETTING ASIDE DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT SARAH KELLEN 
AND REQUIRING KELLEN TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINT 
ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 3, 2009
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant Sarah Kellen’s (“Defendant” or
“Kellen”) Motion to Set Aside Order of Default (DE 42), filed June 23, 2009.  The motion is
fully briefed and ripe for review.  The Court has reviewed the motion, response, reply, and the
record and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.
On June 17, 2009, the Court entered an Order of Default Against Defendant Sarah Kellen
(DE 39).  In that Order, the Court stated that it “has reviewed the affidavit of service
accompanying Plaintiff’s motion for default against Kellen and concludes that Plaintiff effected
service on Defendant Kellen in a manner authorized by New York state law.” See DE 39, citing 
N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 308(4).  The Court concluded that, because Defendant Kellen failed to timely
answer the complaint or otherwise respond thereto, Plaintiff was entitled to an Order of Default

against Kellen. Id.  
In her motion to set aside default, Kellen argues that (1) the process server failed to
exercise “due diligence” before resorting to New York “nail and mail” service; (2) the entry of
default was premature because Plaintiff did not file her proof of service until she filed her motion
for default against Kellen; (3) Kellen has shown good cause for setting aside the default because
her conduct was not willful, litigation is in its early stages, and Kellen has a meritorious defense
to this action.  
Upon review of the process server’s affidavit, the Court concludes that the server
exercised “due diligence” by making six attempts to serve Plaintiff over a twelve-day period, at
varying times of morning and evening, before resorting to New York “nail and mail” service. 
However, Defendant correctly notes that pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 308(4), the time for her to
respond to the complaint did not begin to run until Plaintiff filed “proof of service” with the
Court.  Accordingly, Defendant should have been afforded twenty days to respond to the
complaint from the June 12, 2009 filing of the proof of service before Plaintiff could obtain an
entry of default against her.  Because the default was entered prematurely, the Court will set aside
the Order of Default Against Sarah Kellen (DE 39), without prejudice, for Plaintiff to move for
default against Kellen if she does not respond to the complaint on or before August 3, 2009. 
Additionally, even assuming Defendant’s interpretation of New York law is incorrect, she
had a good faith basis to believe that the time for her to answer the complaint had not expired. 
Thus, at the very least, she has shown excusable neglect.  Defendant also asserts meritorious
defenses and Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the setting aside of the default.  Accordingly, it is
hereby

or before August 3, 2009.

Florida, this 22  day of July, 2009.
