UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA  
 
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a 
JANE DOE #1, 
  
 
Plaintiff, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY ROBSON, 
and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
____________________________________/ 
 
DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S  
OPPOSED MOTION TO ALIGN RESPONSE DATE  
 
 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein moves, pursuant to S.D. Fla. L.R. 7.1(A), to align 
the deadline for filing his response to the complaint with the deadlines set in Jane 
Doe Nos. 2 through 5 of September 4, 2008, and as grounds for this relief, 
respectfully states as follows: 
1. 
This matter was removed to Federal Court on July 21, 2008.  (DE 1).  
2. 
On July 25, 2008, Mr. Epstein filed a motion to stay this action.  (DE 
4 & 5). 
3. 
That same day, Mr. Epstein moved for an enlargement of time to 
answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until ten days after the motion for 
stay was decided.  (DE 3).

4. 
On August 6, 2008, this Court denied the motion for stay. (DE 7).   
5. 
This Court has not yet ruled upon Mr. Epstein’s motion for an 
enlargement of time.   
6. 
In a series of substantially identical lawsuits brought against Mr. 
Epstein, however, this Court - - upon the denial of motions for stay filed in those 
cases - - granted Mr. Epstein an additional ten days to respond to the complaints 
nunc pro tunc.  Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80119-KAM (S.D. Fla.) 
(DE 33); Jane Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80232-KAM (S.D. Fla.) (DE 29); 
Jane Doe No. 4 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80380-KAM (S.D. Fla.) (DE 39); and Jane 
Doe No. 5 v. Epstein, No. 08-80381-CV-KAM (S.D. Fla.) (DE 38).   
7. 
Since then, this Court (upon the parties’ stipulation) has extended the 
time to respond to each of the complaints in Jane Doe Nos. 2 through 5 until 
September 4, 2008.  Jane Doe No. 2 at DE 36; Jane Doe No. 3 at DE 31; Jane Doe 
No. 4 at DE 42; Jane Doe No. 5 at DE 40. 
8. 
Mr. Epstein respectfully requests an enlargement of time until 
September 4, 2008, coterminous with the deadlines set in Jane Doe Nos. 2 through 
5, to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint.    
9. 
An enlargement of time will promote judicial economy because it will 
allow Mr. Epstein to submit (and the plaintiff to respond to, and this Court to 
consider) his responses to the nearly identical complaints at one time.

10. 
Further, such an enlargement will not prejudice the plaintiff in any 
way given that defendants Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson have yet to be served in 
this action.   
WHEREFORE, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully requests an order 
aligning the deadline for filing his response to the complaint with the deadlines set 
in Jane Doe Nos. 2 through 5 of September 4, 2008
