Defendants. 
---------'----------' 
PLAINTIFF'S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE 
CIVIL RICO CASE STATEMENT PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 12.1 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rule 7.l(A) of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for an enlargement of time to file a Civil 
RICO Case Statement under Local Rule 12. I until fifteen days after the Court rules on her 
motion to remand, which will be filed on or about August 18, 2008. 
l. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008. (DE l ). 
2. Because Plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action under section 772.103, Florida 
Statutes, she is reqiiired to file a Civil RICO Case Statement within thirty days of 
removal. See S.D. Fla. L.R. 12.1. 
3. 
Plaintiff believes this action was improperly removed from state court and shall file 
a motion to remand on or about August 18, 2008. It is Plaintiff's contention that the 
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because it does not involve a 
federal question or. parties with complete diversity of citizenship.

time and expense necessary to create and file a Civil Rico Cast Statement, which

enlargement of time to file a Civil RICO Case Statement until fifteen days after the Comt rules 
on her motion to remand.
