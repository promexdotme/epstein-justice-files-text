(Conspir acy to Entice Minors to Travel t o Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges : 
OVERVIEW 
1 . 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL , the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple · minor girls by Jeffrey Epstei n. 
In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at l east in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated , and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epst ein ' s abus e of minor g i rls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit , groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims kno~m to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18 . 
The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Eps tein , both of whom knew 
t hat certain victims were in fact under the age of 18 . 
2 . 
As a part and in furtherance o f t hei r s cheme t o 
abuse minor victims , GHISLAINE MAXWELL , the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victi ms to travel to 

Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. 
Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein , when providing testimony under oath in 2016 . 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates . 
In particular, beLween in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties . 
Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
2 

4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
-Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and thei~ 
families . 
MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. 
Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. 
For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
3 

massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. 
In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. 
Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. 
As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. 
In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. 
Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. 
Epstein 1 s 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
4 

directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals . 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims . 
Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan , New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph: 
5 

b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residencen), which is depicted in the 
following photograph : 
6 

d. 
MAXWELL'S personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. 
In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a . 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. 
MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time . 
During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. 
First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. 
MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 und~essed in front of Epstein. 
Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. 
MAXWELL was present for 
7 

and involved in some of this abuse. 
In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. 
Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. 
As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. 
Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. 
Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. 
MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. 
While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. 
MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. 
In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
8 

an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. 
MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. 
Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. 
MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. 
During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victirn-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. 
Minor

Good day counsels:. 
I thank you for your consideration in this matter. I cannot waive the issue of service of the subpoenas, nor can I disclose 
my client's location to anyone at this time. In the interest of resolving this issue, however, I am willing to collect and 
provide the documents/items on the attached list. As you know, there are rather broad protective orders in the non-VI 
litigation which preclude even me from accessing most of the information in those cases. I have determined that I can 
provide the items on the attached list without running afoul of those protective orders. If you are amenable to resolving 
the subpoenas in this manner please confirm that in writing (perhaps we should draft a short agreement to that 
effect) and I will collect and produce this information to you in short order. 
If you wou Id like to discuss this matter further, please let me know.

RE: EXTERNAL-RE: f/u on our conversation this week 
Apologies for the slow response, and thank you for reaching out. 
First, my reading of the protective order, as with most protective orders, is that Ms. Maxwell can share any document 
that she produced or other discovery material that she designated confidential. 
Second, also per the protective order, Ms. Maxwell could seek the consent of opposing counsel to produce the materials 
produced by the opposing party. 
I suspect that would cover at least substantially all of the documents in that litigation. Please let me know if you 
disagree with my interpretation. 
In part, we focused on these litigation materials because we believe that they would not be burdensome to collect and 
produce. However, we also would be happy to discuss emails or other records that are relevant to the Government's 
investigation in Ms. Maxwell's custody and control that could be produced outside of the protective order. 
Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

Plaintiff, Sarah Ransome 1, by and through her undersigned counsel and pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(l) and the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 
308(5) files this Renewed Motion to Approve Alternative Service and for grounds thereof states: 
As this Court is aware, Defendant Maxwell is also a defendant in another action in the 
Southern District of New York, Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-07433 RWS. In that action, 
Maxwell is represented by counsel who appeared before that Court on her behalf as recently as 
November 8, 2017. Despite that fact, Maxwell will apparently not authorize her counsel to 
accept service of the complaint in this case. Indeed, Maxwell's counsel has gone so far as to hire 
their own separate legal counsel to argue to this Court that they should not have to accept service 
in this case. Yet in this very case, Maxwell has already actively participated, including having 
counsel make a request for additional time to serve her answer and attempting to impose

Court held a hearing on November 28, 2017 and issued an Order on November 30, 2017 
instructing Ms. Ransome to again attempt service on Defendant Maxwell on or before January 5, 
2018: "By that date, the plaintiff will file either proof of service or a renewed appl ication to the 
alternate service." DE 90. As directed, Ms. Ransome has made the following attempts to 
effectuate service on Maxwell: 
• 
Ms. Ransome provided Maxwell's counsel of record in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case a 
copy of the summons and complaint; 
• 
Ms. Ransome emailed a copy of the summons and complaint to the following email 
address which is publicly associated with Maxwell, gmax@ellmax.com. See 
Mccawley Deel. at Exhibit I, December 4, 2017 E-mail; 
• 
Ms. Ransome retained, at significant expense, a private investigation firm to attempt 
to effectuate service at locations associated with Maxwell in New York and New 
Jersey, including the following addresses: 
l. 116 E. 65th Street, New York, NY 10065; 
2. 457 Madison Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, 1\TY 10022; and 
3. 55 Monterey Avenue, Teaneck, NJ 07666. 
As detailed in the affidavit of Investigator Douglas Mercer (See McCawley Deel. at 
Exhibit 2), at one location, it was clear that individuals were present in the home but 
were refusing to answer the door and accept service; 
• 
Ms. Ransome conducted a public record search of the London Townhome that was 
identified in Epstein's Phone Directory as being associated with Defendant Maxwell: 
44 Kinnerton Street, London. The UK government record request demonstrates that 
title to the property was changed on March 17, 2016 to Eaton Square Prope1iies 
Limited and is no longer owned by Defendant Maxwell rendering attempts at service 
in London futile. See McCawley Deel. at Exhibit 3, Summary of Title NGL948023; 
and

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell is also identified as the founder of the TerraMar 
Project on its website. The organization has a New York address for its headquarters 
at 326 E. 65 th Street #326, New York, New York 10065. The email address identified 
with the organization is hello@theterramarproject.org. On January 4, 2018, we 
served a copy of the summons and complaint to the following potential email 
addresses: 
1. gmaxwell@theterramarproiect.org; 
2. maxwellg@theterramarproject.org; 
3. ghislaine@theterramarproject.org; 
4. gmax@thetenamarproject.org; 
5. maxwe1l@theterramarproject.org; and 
6. ghislaine.maxwell@thetenamarproject.org. 
See McCawley Deel. at Exhibit 4. The only email address which received a delivery 
failure message was maxwell@theterramarproject.org. 
Accordingly, having made renewed - and unsuccessful efforts - to serve Maxwell 
through conventional means, Ms. Ransome now renews her request for alternative service as 
such means as the Court may find appropriate. Ms. Ransome respectfully suggests that, as the 
Court allowed in its previous order, that service of the complaints on cunent legal counsel 
representing her in a related matter before this Comt and other publicly identified email accounts 
be permitted as a means of alternative service. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Service of a Complaint should not be a game of cat and mouse paiticularly where the 
defendant is represented by counsel in a matter pending in the same district. See Carillo v. 
Hagerty, No. 3:05CV1417 (MRK), 2006 WL 2165679, at * 1 (D. Conn. July 31, 2006) (comt 
3 

Case 1:17-cv-00616-JGK-SN Document 97 Filed 01/05/18 Page 4 of 8 
finding defendant should not benefit from service gamesmanship reasoning that: "service of 
process is not intended to be a game of hide and seek or cat and mouse."). 
Based on the exhaustion of the other methods of service delineated above, Ms. Ransome 
moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(l), for an order permitting service by 
an alternative method. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(l) provides that service upon a 
party may be effected by "following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in 
courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is 
made." Accordingly, Defendant Maxwell may be served pursuant to CPLR § 308, which 
provides several methods by which service upon a natural person may be effectuated, including 
personal service; service by "delivering the summons ... to a person of suitable age and discretion 
at the actual place of business, dwelling place or usual place of abode of the person to be served" 
and then mailing the summons to the individual's "last know residence;" or service by "affixing 
the summons to the door of either the actual place of business, dwelling place or usual place of 
abode within the state of the person to be served" and then "mailing the summons to such person 
at his or her last known residence" or to his or her place of business - so called "nail and mail" 
service. CPLR §§ 308(1), (2) & (4). 
If service under CPLR §§ 308(1), (2) & (4) is impracticable, CPLR § 308(5) permits 
service "in such manner as the court, upon motion without notice, directs." The determination of 
whether service is impracticable "depends upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case." 
Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. HGL Inc., No. 99 Civ. 3866 (DLC), 1999 WL 1021087, at *1 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 1999). Although the plaintiff must show impracticability of service, there is 
no requirement of "proof of due diligence or of actual prior attempts to serve a party under the 
other provisions of the statute." Id. "When usual methods of service prove impracticable, service 
4 

Case 1:17-cv-00616-JGK-SN Document 97 Filed 01/05/18 Page 5 of 8 
that is reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise the interested party of the 
pendency of the action will suffice." D.R.!., Inc. v. Dennis, No. 03 Civ. 10026 (PKL), 2004 WL 
1237511, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2004). 
New York Courts consistently affirm their right to direct or approve alternative methods 
of service where regular service has been deemed "impracticable." For example, in Dobkin v. 
Chapman, 21 N.Y.2d 490,498,289 N.Y.S.2d 161, 168 (1968), the New York Court of Appeals 
held that where a plaintiff could not follow the prescribed methods of service as set forth in § 
308, Courts are "given the discretion to fashion other means adapted to the particular facts of the 
case before it" pursuant to § 308(5) (referred to in Dobkin as § 308( 4), the predecessor to § 
308(5)). Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that a Court's discretion to fashion such methods 
of service "must be broad" if the statute is to be "meaningful." Id. at 499, 289 N.Y.S.2d at 168. 
There is no doubt that Defendant Maxwell has had actual notice and knowledge of the 
claims asserted in this Complaint. Ms. Ransome has tried multiple alternative avenues to serve 
Maxwell, including (1) sending the documents to her current counsel in another matter, (2) 
investigating and attempting service at multiple locations known to be associated with Defendant 
Maxwell, and (3) emailing the documents to Defendant Maxwell's publicly available email 
address. As a result, this Court should deem the service methods attempted to be sufficient and 
grant the Motion for Alternate Service. See Rampersad v. Deutsche Bank Secs., Inc., No. 02 Civ. 
7311 (LTS), 2003 WL21073951, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2003) (authorizing alternative service 
under§ 308(5) when Plaintiff was unable to determine Defendant's residence or place of 
business after "extensive Internet searches" and inquires with Defendant's former clients); Javier 
H. v. Garcia-Botello, 217 F.R.D. 308,309 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (service by publication authorized 
when individual Defendant was a fugitive from the criminal justice system; was likely aware of 
5 

Case 1:17-cv-00616-JGK-SN Document 97 Filed 01/05/18 Page 6 of 8 
the pending civil action through his relatives, who were co-Defendants; and when the Court 
determined that Defendant would likely read a newspaper that was circulated in the region of his 
last known residence); see also HG!, Inc., 1999 WL 1021087, at *1 (service by publication in 
USA Today authorized when Defendant's whereabouts were unknown, efforts to locate his home 
or business address by searching computer databases failed, and there existed no record that he 
designated an agent for service); D.R./., Inc., 2004 WL 1237511, at *2 (after Plaintiff 
unsuccessfully attempted to serve Defendant through a process server and searched databases for 
his address, Court authorized service by sending process by certified mail to Defendant's last 
known address; by publishing the action in a local newspaper; and by emailing it to Plaintiffs 
last known email address). 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for this Court to enter an Order granting Plaintiffs 
Motion to Approve Alternative Service Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
4(e)(l) and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 308(5) upon Defendant Ghislaine 
Maxwell and finding that the service efforts made by Plaintiffs counsel herein are sufficient.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 
John G. Koeltl, 
nited States District Judge 
1'1 The plaintiff, Sarah Ransome 1 , has moved the Court 
to approve alternative service on the defendant Ghislaine 
Maxwell and to find that service has been effected. The 
plaintiff asserts that, despite diligent measures, she has been 
unable to serve Maxwell personally. The plaintiff argues, 
however, that she has taken reasonable measures to provide 
Maxwell with notice of the pending lawsuit and requests that 
this service should be deemed suffic ient. Non-party Haddon 
Morgan & Foreman, P.C. ("Haddon Morgan'·), Maxwell's 
counsel in another litigation pending in this Court, has refused 
to accept service on behalf of Maxwell and has objected to 
becoming a general agent of process for Maxwell, but has 
taken no position on the plaintiff's application to deem service 
effected through the email efforts that the plaintiff has already 
made. Neither Maxwell nor any representative of Maxwell 
has otherwise opposed the current motion. 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)( I) permits a plaintiff 
to serve a defendant by following the procedures set fo1th 
by state law in the state where the district court is located. 
New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 308 sets 
fo1t h available methods of service. Where service under 
§§ 308( I), (2), or ( 4)-which generally provide variants of 
personal service-is impracticable, § 308(5) provides that 
the Court may approve alternative service methods. See, 
e. 0 .. 
Rampersad v. Deutsche Bank Sec., Inc., No. 02-
cv-7311 (LTS)(AJP), 2003 WL 21073951 , at * I (S.D.N.Y. 
May 9, 2003). Service under § 308(5) requires a showing of 
impractieabil ity of the other methods of se1v ice, bur does not 
require a showing of due di ligence. Id. 
The plaintiff has taken various steps in an effort to serve 
Maxwell personally-
all to no avail. The plaintiff retained 
a private investigation firm to attempt to determine where 
Maxwell resides, and that firm attempted service at three 
physical addresses potentially associated with Maxwell. The 
plaintiff also emai led the summons and complaint to several 
email addresses that are publicly associated with Maxwell, 
only one of wh ich has been rel"urned as undelivered. The 
plaintiff has also provided a copy of the summons and 
complaint to Haddon Morgan who currently represents 
Maxwell in another litigation pending in this district. 
Under these circumstances, the plaintiff has demonsh·ated 
impracticability, because she has made numerous efforts to 
obtain info rmation about the defendant's current residence 
and general contact information to effectuate personal service 
but has been unable to locate Maxwell. See e.!!:., 
S.E.C. 
v. 
nebe, No. 01-cv-5247 (KMW), 2003 WL 402377, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21 , 2003) (collecting cases). Accordingly, the 
Court fi nds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that service 
on Maxwell is impracticable and thus grants the motion fo r 
alternative service. 
*2 Further, the steps already taken by the plaintiff to serve 
Maxwell are "reasonably calculated, under the circumstances, 
to appri se [her] of the pendency of the action and afford [her] 
an opportunity to present lhe]r objections," and the Court 
therefore deems service of the summons and complaint lo be 
complete as to defendant Maxwell. See, e.g., Bozza v. Love. 
o. I 5-CV-3271 (LGS), 2015 WL 4039849, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
July I, 20 15) (holding that service upon the defendant's 
counsel in an unrelated matter was sufficient); 
Rampersad, 
2003 WL 21073951, at *l. 
Pinal ly, Haddon Morgan's objection to becoming a general 
agent of process fo r Maxwell is un founded. The Court's 
ruling that service by email and personal delivery to Haddon 
Morgan has been reasonably calculated to provide Maxwell 
with noti ce of this lawsuit and an opportunity to respond does 
not turn Haddon Morgan into a general agent for Maxwell. 
Indeed, this order does not even require Haddon Morgan to 
son Reuters No cla m to on tral U S Gove m nt Works 

Ransome v. Epstein, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2018) 
2018 WL 637421 
accept service on behalf of Maxwell, but rather finds that 
service on Haddon Morgan is likely to provide notice of the 
lawsuit to Maxwell, given that Haddon Morgan is presumably 
in contact with Maxwel l with regards to theiJ· representation 
of her in the other pending matter. See Bozza, 2015 WL 
4039849, at *2. 
Accordingly, the motion for alternative service is granted. 
The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motion pending 
at Docket Number 97. Defendant Maxwell's time to move 
or answer is twenty-one clays from the date of this order. 
lf Maxwell chooses not to appear, the plaintiff may pursue 
whatever remedies are available, including the entry of a 
default judgment. 
SO ORDERED.
