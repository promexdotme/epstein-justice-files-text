CONSENT ORDER FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY 
The Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (“Comptroller”), 
through his national bank examiners and other staff of the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (“OCC”), has conducted examinations of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, 
Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, California; and Chase Bank 
USA, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware (collectively referred to as “Bank”).  The OCC has identified 
deficiencies in the Bank’s Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (“BSA/AML”) compliance 
program, resulting in violations of 31 U.S.C. § 5318(i) and its implementing regulation,  
31 C.F.R. § 1010.610(a), (b) and (c); 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s) and its implementing regulation,  
12 C.F.R. § 21.21(c); and 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c) and (d).  The Bank is also the subject of a prior 
OCC Consent Cease and Desist Order issued on January 14, 2013 (“January 2013 Order”).   
Examinations conducted subsequent to the issuance of the January 2013 Order have 
revealed additional deficiencies in the Bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, which resulted in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 2 of 20

the citation of additional violations of law and regulation.  The Bank has been notified of the 
findings of these examinations.  
The Bank, by and through its duly elected and acting Boards of Directors, has executed a 
“Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order for the Assessment of a Civil 
Money Penalty,” dated January 7, 2014, that is accepted by the Comptroller (“Stipulation”).  By 
this Stipulation, which is incorporated herein by reference, the Bank has consented to the 
issuance of this Consent Order for the Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty (“Consent Order”) 
by the Comptroller. 
On January 6, 2014, the Bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) 
with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  In the DPA, the 
Bank admitted to certain facts concerning the failure to file a Suspicious Activity Report 
(“SAR”) in the United States on Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, LLC (“Madoff”). 
ARTICLE I 
COMPTROLLER’S FINDINGS 
The Comptroller finds the following: 
The Comptroller incorporates the following findings from Article I of the January 2013 
Order: 
(1) 
The OCC’s examination findings establish that the Bank has deficiencies in its 
BSA/AML compliance program.  These deficiencies have resulted in the failure to correct a 
previously reported problem and a BSA/AML compliance program violation under 
12 U.S.C. § 1818(s) and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. § 21.21 (BSA Compliance 
2  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 3 of 20

Program).  In addition, the Bank has violated 12 C.F.R. § 21.11 (Suspicious Activity Report 
Filings). 
(2) 
The Bank has failed to adopt and implement a compliance program that 
adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate system of 
internal controls and ineffective independent testing.  The Bank did not develop adequate due 
diligence on customers, particularly in the Commercial and Business Banking Unit, a repeat 
problem, and failed to file all necessary SARs related to suspicious customer activity. 
(3) 
The Bank failed to correct previously identified systemic weaknesses in the 
adequacy of customer due diligence and the effectiveness of monitoring in light of the 
customers’ cash activity and business type, constituting a deficiency in its BSA/AML 
compliance program and resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(B). 
(4) 
Some of the critical deficiencies in the elements of the Bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program, resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(A) and 12 C.F.R. § 21.21, 
include the following: 
(a) 
The Bank has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing. 
(b) 
The Bank has less than satisfactory risk assessment processes that do not provide 
an adequate foundation for management’s efforts to identify, manage, and control risk. 
(c) 
The Bank has systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring systems, due 
diligence processes, risk management, and quality assurance programs. 
(d) 
The Bank does not have enterprise-wide policies and procedures to ensure that 
foreign branch suspicious activity involving customers of other bank branches is effectively 
communicated to other affected branch locations and applicable AML operations staff.  The 
3  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 4 of 20

Bank also does not have enterprise-wide policies and procedures to ensure that on a risk basis, 
customer transactions at foreign branch locations can be assessed, aggregated, and monitored. 
(e) 
The Bank has significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making protocols and an 
ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts are properly documented, tracked, and 
resolved. 
(5) 
The Bank failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and file the 
required SARs concerning suspicious customer activities, in violation of 12 C.F.R. § 21.11.  In 
some of these cases, the Bank self-identified the issues and is engaged in remediation. 
(6) 
The Bank’s internal controls, including filtering processes and independent 
testing, with respect to Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) compliance are inadequate. 
The Comptroller further finds, for purposes of this Consent Order: 
(7) 
The Bank has not established adequate BSA/AML and due diligence programs for 
its foreign branches, offices, or affiliates in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5318(i) (implementing 
Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 312(a), 115 Stat. 272, 312 
(2001)), and 12 C.F.R. § 21.21(c). This violation includes the Bank's failure to conduct 
suspicious activity monitoring of transactions between the Bank and certain of the Bank's 
affiliates. 
(8) 
The Bank did not establish and implement an adequate BSA/AML program for 
correspondent banking and remote deposit capture (“RDC”) and international cash letter (“ICL”) 
products or adequate internal controls, including the Bank’s due diligence programs, in the 
correspondent banking and RDC/ICL areas. Inadequate controls resulted in certain special 
accommodation clients in the Bank that operated outside of the normal AML monitoring and 
OFAC screening controls. For these reasons, the Bank is in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5318(i),  
4  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 5 of 20

12 U.S.C. § 1818(s), 12 C.F.R. § 21.21(c), and 31 C.F.R. § 1010.610(a), (b), and (c).  These 
failures also caused the Bank to fail to file SARs and to do so timely in violation of 12 C.F.R.  
§ 21.11(c) and (d). 
(9) 
The Bank has failed to correct previously reported problems in several areas, 
including Asia Private Banking, and with respect to one of its correspondent bank relationships, 
resulting in additional violations of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s).  
(10)
 The Bank’s SAR filing processes and procedures for SAR filing in the areas of 
Chase Auto Finance and Student Lending were inadequate, and the Bank further failed in certain 
instances to file SARs related to suspected fraud by employees, resulting in violations of  
12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c). 
(11) 
Between 2006 and 2008, the Bank created, sold and made a secondary market for 
structured products that provided customers access to Madoff’s investment strategy through 
several “feeder funds.” Prior to Bernard L. Madoff’s arrest, the Bank developed concerns about 
Madoff and a distributor of Madoff-linked investments created by the Bank.  These concerns 
caused the Bank’s London branch to file a suspicious activity report with the United Kingdom’s 
Serious Organised Crime Agency on October 29, 2008.  Aware that Madoff was a client of the 
Bank in the U.S., U.K.-based Bank employees conveyed these concerns to U.S.-based Bank 
employees.  Despite the fact that these concerns caused the Bank to file a suspicious activity 
report in the U.K., the Bank did not file a SAR in the U.S. based on these concerns.  The failure 
to file a SAR on this activity and to do so timely is significant and a violation of 12 C.F.R.  
§ 21.11(c) and (d). 
(12)
ﾭ
­
chartered affiliate of a Venezuelan bank. Although the Bank filed SARs relating to this 
5  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 6 of 20

correspondent account, the Bank did not investigate additional suspicious activity, totaling over 
$2 billion, pertaining to counterparties that flowed through the account at the Bank.  The failure 
to file SARs on this activity and to do so timely is significant and in violation of 12 C.F.R.  
§ 21.11(c) and (d). 
(13) 
From 2004 to 2010, the Bank failed to adequately monitor, investigate and file 
SARs on approximately $450 million of suspicious bulk cash transactions in an account at the 
Bank for another of its correspondents. The failure to file SARs on this activity and to do so 
timely is significant and in violation of 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c) and (d). 
(14) 
From February 2013 to March 2013, the Bank failed to adequately monitor and 
file a supplemental SAR on ongoing activity relating to $471,680 in suspicious transactions in an 
account at the Bank for a third correspondent.  The failure to file SARs on this activity and to do 
so timely is significant and in violation of 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c) and (d). 
ARTICLE II

practices, or the continuation of a pattern or practice of violations or unsafe or unsound practices.

STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CONSENT ORDER FOR 
THE ASSESSMENT OF A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY 
The Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (“Comptroller”), based 
upon information derived from the exercise of his regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, 
intends to initiate a civil money penalty (“CMP”) proceeding against JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., Columbus, Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, California; 
and Chase Bank USA, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware (collectively referred to as “Bank”), 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i), based on serious deficiencies in the Bank’s Bank Secrecy 
Act/anti-money laundering (“BSA/AML”) compliance program and violations of Suspicious 
Activity Reporting laws and regulations. 
In the interest of cooperation and to avoid additional costs associated with administrative 
and judicial proceedings with respect to the above matter, and without an adjudication on the 
merits, the Bank, through its duly elected and acting Boards of Directors (“Boards”), has agreed 
to execute this Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order for the Assessment of 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 11 of 20

a Civil Money Penalty (“Stipulation”), that is accepted by the Comptroller, through his duly 
authorized representative. 
In consideration of the above premises, it is stipulated by the Bank that: 
ARTICLE I

The Bank is a national banking association chartered and examined by the 
Comptroller pursuant to the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, 12 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.

pursuant to 12 U.S.C. §§ 1813(q) and 1818(i). 
(3) 
The Bank is an “insured depository institution” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 
§ 1818(i). 
ARTICLE II  
CONSENT  
(1) 
The Bank consents and agrees to issuance of the accompanying Consent Order for 
the Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty (“Consent Order”) by the Comptroller.

The terms and provisions of the Consent Order apply to JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., Columbus, Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, California; 
and Chase Bank USA, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware; and all their subsidiaries, even though those 
subsidiaries are not named as parties to the Consent Order. 
(3) 
The Bank consents and agrees that the Consent Order shall be deemed an “order 
issued with the consent of the depository institution” pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(h)(2), and

Comptroller through his authorized representative, and shall be fully enforceable by the 
Comptroller pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i).   
(4)

a contract, the Comptroller may enforce any of the commitments or obligations herein 
undertaken by the Bank under his supervisory powers, including 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i), and not as 
a matter of contract law.  The Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Bank nor the 
Comptroller has any intention to enter into a contract. 
(5)

Bank to consent to the issuance of the Consent Order and/or execute this Stipulation. 
(6) 
The Bank expressly acknowledges that no officer or employee of the Comptroller 
has statutory or other authority to bind the United States, the United States Treasury Department, 
the Comptroller, or any other federal bank regulatory agency or entity, or any officer or 
employee of any of those entities to a contract affecting the Comptroller’s exercise of his 
supervisory responsibilities. 
(7)

I of the Consent Order may be utilized by the Comptroller in other future enforcement actions 
against the Bank or its institution-affiliated parties, including, without limitation, to establish a 
pattern or practice of violations or unsafe and unsound practices, or the continuation of a pattern 
or practice of violations or unsafe or unsound practices.  Nothing in the Consent Order shall 
preclude or affect any right of the Comptroller to determine and ensure compliance with the 
terms and provisions of this Stipulation, the Consent Order, or the prior OCC Consent Cease and 
Desist Order issued on January 14, 2013 (“January 2013 Order”).
