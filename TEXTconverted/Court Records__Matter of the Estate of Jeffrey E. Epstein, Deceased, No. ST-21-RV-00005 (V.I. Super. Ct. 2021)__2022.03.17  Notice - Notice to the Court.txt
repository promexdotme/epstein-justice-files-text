GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' 
OPPOSITION TO CO-EXECUTORS' MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES 
The Government of the United States Virgin Islands ("Government") hereby responds in 
opposition to the Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees brought by the Co-Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Epstein Estate") (the "Epstein Estate's Motion") regarding the 
Government's Motion to Intervene in the Probate Action, the Government's Emergency Motion 
to Immediately Freeze All Assets and Cash on Hand, and the Government's Notice of Appeal and 
Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders. 
The Epstein Estate's Motion is baseless and should be denied. First, the Epstein Estate is 
not entitled to attorneys' fees, because the underlying orders are not "judgment[ s ]" and the Epstein 
Estate is not the "prevailing party". Second, even if underlying orders were judgments and the 
Epstein Estate was the prevailing party-both of which are not true-the Court should exercise its 
discretion to deny the Epstein Estate's request for attorneys' fees. Requiring the Government to 
pay the Epstein Estate's attorneys' fees when the Government may ultimately prevail in its claims 
and is acting as a law enforcement agency to protect the public is contrary to the policy behind 
section 541. Third, the Epstein Estate's request for over $112,000 in attorneys' fees is extremely 
unreasonable.

BACKGROUND 
On January 15, 2020, the Government filed a lawsuit against the Estate, the 1953 Trust, 
and numerous Epstein business affiliates and associates for violation of the Criminally Influenced 
and Corrupt Organization Act (''CICO"), 14 V.I.C. § 600 et seq., and civil conspiracy, seeking 
forfeiture and divestment of assets in favor of the Government, civil penalties, damages, and other 
remedies (a redacted copy of the Government's Second Amended Complaint is attached as 
Government Exhibit 1 ). The Government alleges that for decades Jeffrey Epstein conducted an 
enterprise whereby he used his web of businesses in the Virgin Islands to transport female victims, 
many of them children, to his privately-owned Little St. James Island, where they were sexually 
abused, injured, and held captive in violation of Virgin Islands criminal laws. See Ex. 1, 2d 
Amend. Compl. ,I,I 43-75. The Government further alleges that Southern Trust Company, Inc.-
a Virgin Islands corporation of which Jeffrey Epstein was President/Director and Co-Executors 
Darren K. lndyke and Richard D. Kahn were corporate officers-committed fraud against the 
Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority by claiming at least $80.5 million in unearned 
tax benefits. See id. at ,r,r 157-176. 
On January 23, 2020, the Government filed its Motion to Intervene in the Probate Action 
("Government's Motion to Intervene") and on February 4, 2021, the Government filed its 
Emergency Motion to Immediately Freeze All Assets and Cash on Hand ("Government's Motion 
to Freeze Assets"). On February 26, 2021, the Court denied the Government's Motion to Intervene 
without prejudice and directed the Government to file a claim in the Epstein Estate instead of 
seeking to intervene. The Court also struck the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets.

The Court's orders on the Government's Motion to Intervene and the Government's 
Motion to Freeze Assets were formally issued on February 26, 2021. On March 17, 2021, the 
Government filed its Notice of Appeal and Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders 
("Government's Petition for Review") pursuant to V.I. Super. Ct. R. 322(b)(l) and/or 322.l(b). 
On February 4, 2022, the Court denied the Government's Petition for Review with 
prejudice, finding that the underlying orders were not final judgments eligible for appeal. 
On February 22, 2022, the Government filed a claim in the Epstein Estate. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
THE EPSTEIN EST ATE IS NOT ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS' FEES UNDER 
SECTION 541 
Section 541 (b) provides that courts may award attorneys' fees to "the prevailing party in 
the judgment." 5 V.I.C. § 541. 1 Here, the underlying orders are not "judgment[s]" and the Epstein 
Estate is not the "prevailing party." Thus, the Epstein Estate's requests for attorneys' fees should 
be denied. 
A. 
The Orders Underlying the Epstein's Estate's Request For Attorneys' Fees 
Are Not Judgments 
Rule 54 of the Virgin Islands defines judgment as "a decree and any order from which an 
appeal lies." The Rule embraces two different types of orders: ( 1) any final decision from which 
an appeal is permitted, and (2) any appealable interlocutory order. See Island Tile and Marble, 
1 The Epstein Estate cites to 15 V.I.C. § 165 to support its request for attorneys' fees. The standard 
for awarding attorneys' fees under section 165 is the same as the standard for awarding attorneys' 
fees under 5 V.I.C. § 541. See Ka/loo v. Estate of Small, 62 V.I. 571,582 (V.1. 2015) (applying 
the attorneys' fees standard of section 5 V.I.C. § 541 to a claim for attorneys' fees under 15 V.I.C. 
§ 165).

LLC v. Bertrand, 57 V.I. 596,614 (V.I. 2012) (citing to 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller 
& Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure§ 2651 (1998)).2 
The orders stemming from the Government's Motion to Intervene and the Government's 
Motion to Freeze Assets are not final decisions. The orders unquestionably do not dispose of the 
litigation. Further, the Court denied the Government's Motion to Intervene without prejudice and 
struck the Government's Motion to Freeze assets-allowing the Government to correct the errors 
identified by the Court. In addition, the Court's orders do not specify that they are final judgments, 
and the Court did not "expressly determine[] that there is no just reason for delay." V.I. R. Civ. P. 
54(b). The Superior Court Judge reviewing the Government's Petition for Review found these 
facts to be determinative in finding that the orders were not final orders eligible for appeal. As 
such, the Court reviewed the Government's Petition for Review pursuant to its reconsideration 
authority under 4 V.I.C. § 123(c), not as an appeal pursuant to section 322(b)(l) or 322.l(b). See 
Feb. 4, 2022 Mem. Order at 3; see also Valerino v. Manning, 68 V.I. 276, 301 (V.1. Super. Ct. 
2018) ("appeal is not the same as reconsideration"). 
Similarly, these orders are not appealable interlocutory orders. Interlocutory orders can 
only be appealed in limited circumstances, such as granting/modifying/refusing an injunction, 
appointing receivers or refusing orders to wind up receivership, and other orders in which the 
Superior Court judge finds a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for 
2 Decisions by the Virgin Islands Supreme Court and Superior Court interpreting and applying the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure remain applicable where the relevant provision of the Virgin 
Islands Rules of Civil Procedure resemble its federal counterpart. See Gov 't of the V.l v. Takata 
Corp., 67 V.I. 316,336 & n.13 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2017).

difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the 
ultimate termination of litigation. See 4 V.I.C. § 33(b). None of those circumstances apply here.3 
8. 
The Epstein Estate Is Not The Prevailing Party 
The test adopted by the Superior Court for determining whether a party is a "prevailing 
party" is whether a party has achieved at least some of the benefits sought in litigation. Rohn v. 
Daily News Pub/'g Co., Inc., 72 V.I. 301, 308-09 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2019). "Under this standard, 
'the operative criteria for such an award of attorney's fees is success at the conclusion of 
proceedings, rather than the means by which success is achieved."' Id. (internal citation omitted). 
As such, attorneys' fees are awarded '"at the conclusion of litigation', not in the beginning or in 
the midst of it." Bell v. Radcl([fe, 2014 V.I. LEXIS 119, at *7 (V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2014) 
("None of the defendants are 'prevailing parties' because this matter is still pending.") (internal 
citation omitted). 
As discussed above, the Court's denial of the Government's Motion to Intervene and 
striking of the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets were not final judgments and did not dispose 
of this litigation. To the contrary, the Government has now filed a claim in this proceeding and is 
free to seek the same type of relief it requested as an intervenor. A warding attorneys' fees to the 
Epstein Estate when the Government may still ultimately prevail and obtain the same relief it 
requested as an intervenor contradicts the entire notion of a prevailing party. 
3 The Court did not deny the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets. The Court simply struck the 
motion, allowing the Government to later refile.

II. 
THE COURT SHOULD EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION UNDER SECTION 541 
TO DENY THE EPSTEIN ESTATE'S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES 
Even if the Court believes the Epstein Estate's request for attorneys' fees satisfies the 
prerequisites of section 541-which the Government strongly disputes-the Court should still 
deny the Epstein Estate's request. It is within the Court's discretion to grant or deny attorneys' 
fees pursuant to section 541. See Mahabir v. Heirs of George, 2021 V.I. 22, 4 (V.I. 2021) ("Section 
541 (b) provides that the court 'may' award attorneys' fees 'in its discretion."'). The policy behind 
section 541 is that "a party should not have to bear the legal expenses of demonstrating either that 
it is not at fault or that it is the victim of another's fault." M & N Aviation, Inc. v. United Parcel 
Servs., Inc., No. 2010-0083, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37382, at *6-*7 (D.V.I. Mar. 21, 2014). As 
discussed above, the Court has not considered, let alone decided, the merits of the Government's 
claims. It is possible (and in the Government's view, likely) that the Government will ultimately 
prevail in its claims against the Epstein Estate, which would make awarding attorneys' fees to the 
Epstein Estate contrary to the policy behind section 541. 
Further, unlike the cases cited by the Epstein Estate, Epstein Estate's Motion at 6, the 
Government's claims relate to a law enforcement action the Government initiated to protect the 
public. The Government filed the underlying motions to ensure the Epstein Estate preserved assets 
to compensate victims and the people of the Virgin Islands for Jeffrey Epstein's illegal conduct. 
The Court directed the Government to enter the probate action as a claimant-rather than an 
intervenor-to accomplish this goal. Requiring the Government to pay the Epstein Estate's 
attorneys' fees under these circumstances is contrary to the spirit of section 541 and unjust.

III. 
THE EPSTEIN ESTATE'S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES IS 
EXTREMELY UNREASONABLE 
The Epstein Estate's request for attorneys' fees is extremely unreasonable. Counsel's 
hourly rates are excessive and their billing entries contain vague descriptions, duplicative tasks, 
unrelated work, and clerical duties. In the event the Court decides to award attorneys' fees, the 
attorneys' hourly rates should be reduced to a maximum of $350 per hour and all inappropriate 
billing entries should be excluded. 
A. 
Counsel's Hourly Rates Are Excessive 
When determining the reasonableness of an hourly rate, courts compare the hourly rate 
being charged with the customary charges of Virgin Islands attorneys. See Lakeview Loan Serv., 
LLC v. Singh, 74 V.I. 439, 449 (V.I. Super. Ct. July 28, 2021 ). "It is universally accepted that the 
party seeking fees bears the burden of 'producing satisfactory evidence-in addition to the 
attorney's own affidavit-that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the 
community for similar services by lawyers of reasonable comparable skill, experience, and 
reputation."' Isaac v. Rhonda Crichlow, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 145, *9 (V.I. Super. Ct. Sept. 29, 2016) 
(citing Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886 (1984)). The Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands has held 
that a reasonable hourly rate is calculated according to the prevailing market in the community. 
See Hodge v. Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110340, at *4 (D.V.I. 
Nov. 25, 2009) (noting requested fees must be based on "counsel's usual billing rates, which are 
in accord with customary and prevailing market rates in the Virgin Islands" for legal services). The 
Estate's reliance on New York rates and rates above the prevailing market rates for attorneys in 
the Virgin Islands is misplaced. Virgin Islands courts have found hourly rates between $250-$350

In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-2019-PB-00080 
Page8 
to be reasonable, including a $350 hourly rate for a trial counsel who had practiced law for 37 
years. See Lakeview Loan Serv., 74 V.I. at 449. In 2019, in Matter of Estate of Benjamin, 70 V.I. 
110, 114, 117-18 (V.I. 2019), the Court found the $350 hourly rate of attorney Marjorie Whalen-
one of the attorneys now representing the Epstein Estate and requesting fees-to be excessive and 
reduced the hourly rate to $300. 
The Epstein Estate is seeking over $112,000 for less than 150 hours of work billed at the 
following hourly rates: 
Attorney Daniel H. Weiner 
Attorney Andrew Heymann 
Attorney Christopher Kroblin 
Attorney Marjorie Whalen 
Attorney Shari D' Andrade 
Legal Assistant Shauna Betz 
$1,315 (2020) 
$1,251 (2021) 
$630 (2020) 
$660 (2021) 
$500 
$360 
$400 
$135 
See Epstein Estate's Mot., Aff. Daniel H. Weiner, Ex. B; Epstein Estate's Mot., Aff. Christopher 
A. Kroblin, Ex. 8. 
These hourly rates are excessive and far exceed the customary charges of Virgin Islands 
attorneys, which range from $250-$350 per hour. Attorney Weiner's rate, for example, exceeds 
the high-end of the customary range by almost $1,000. If the Court awards the Epstein Estate 
attorneys' fees, it should reduce each attorney's hourly rate to no more than $350 per hour.

B. 
Several Billing Entries Are Inappropriate And Should Be Excluded 
Counsel for the Epstein Estate submitted several, inappropriate billing entries that should 
be excluded, including entries that contain vague descriptions, duplicative tasks, unrelated matters, 
and clerical work. A chart identifying the Government's specific objections to counsel's billing 
entries is attached as Government Exhibit 2. 4 
1. 
Vague Descriptions 
Requests for attorneys' fees must be sufficiently specific to allow the court to determine 
whether the hours claimed are unreasonable for the work performed. See Crown Bay Marina, L.P. 
v. Subbase Drydock, Inc., No. 2018-68, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129178, at *6 (D.V.I. July 12, 
2021 ). Courts have found that entries lumping together multiple tasks without identifying the 
amount of time spent on each task are not sufficiently specific. Id . 
. 
Several of the Epstein Estate's billing entries have vague descriptions and contain multiple 
tasks, which makes it impossible for the Government to determine what work counsel performed 
and how much time counsel spent on each task. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 2, 5, 7-10, 14-15, 32-
33, 40-41, 43-44, 46-47, 49, 68-70). For example, Attorney Heymann's description for 5.9 billed 
hours is: "Strategize on opposition to AG motion to freeze assets and standard and research and 
related advice to clients." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 4). Similarly, Attorney D' Andrade's 
description for 1.8 billed hours is: "Calendared deadline for response to GVI's emergency motion; 
tried to gain access to court website for docket; called clerk's office to determine when GVI 
4 Government Exhibit 2 is an annotated version of the billing information the Epstein Estate 
provided in its Motion. The Government created additional columns and rows (all highlighted in 
gray) to state its objections and make the chart easier to read.

Page 10 
emergency motion was filed; communication w/team re strategy." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 33). 
These vague entries should be excluded. 
2. 
Duplicative Tasks 
Courts have previously reduced fee awards for duplication of effort among several 
attorneys, including multiple-lawyer conferences not involving opposing counsel. See Morcher v. 
Nash, 32 F. Supp. 2d 239,258 (D.V.I. 1998). The Epstein Estate's Motion contains several billing 
entries for duplicative work. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 1-6, 8, 11-13, 16-18, 22, 24, 26-28, 30-
32, 36, 38, 50-54, 56-61, 63-70). For example, Attorneys Weiner, Heymann, Kroblin, Whalen, 
and Andrade all billed time to drafting and editing opposition to the Government's Motion to 
Intervene. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 1-2, 5-6, 8, 22, 24, 26-28, 31-32, 50-54). The Government 
should not have to pay counsel's exorbitant hourly rates for several attorneys to perform the same 
tasks. Thus, the Court should exclude all duplicative entries. 
3. 
Unrelated Matters 
The Epstein Estate's Motion also includes tasks unrelated to the Government's Motion to 
Intervene, the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets, or the Government Petition for Review and 
should therefore be excluded. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 2, 5, 7- 10, 14-15, 25, 29, 32, 40, 43, 
50, 55, 62). In some instances, counsel lumps together these unrelated tasks with tasks that do 
relate to the at-issue motions, making it impossible for the Government to separate the appropriate 
and inappropriate billing entries. For example, Attorney Kroblin's description for 2.9 billed hours 
is: "Preparation for hearing including proposed agenda, proposed witnesses, and hearing binders, 
and review of the quarterly accounting and edit of the same." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 7). 
Reviewing and editing the quarterly accounting is not related to the at-issue motions; however, the

Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-2019-PB-00080 
Page 11 
Government cannot determine what portion of the 2.9 billed hours Attorney Kroblin spent on this 
task. As such, these types of entries should be excluded. 
4. 
Clerical Work 
Expenses for clerical work, such as copying and filing, are considered overhead and should 
be excluded. See Crown Bay Marina, L.P., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129178, at *6; see also Matter 
of Estate of Benjamin, 70 V.I. at 117 (excluded hours Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC billed to 
contacting Court's clerks regarding status updates and conferences). The Epstein Estate's Motion 
contains several billing entries for clerical work. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 7, 25, 29, 33, 35, 
40-49). For example, Attorney D' Andrade billed five hours (at $360 per hour) for "prepar[ing] 
binders for February 4 hearing." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 29). 
In addition, the Epstein Estate's Motion includes billing entries for legal assistant Shauna 
Betz. Counsel cites to a case in which Ms. Betz's time was included in an award for attorneys' 
fees, Epstein Estate's Mot. at 14-15; however, counsel failed to explain that in that case, Ms. Betz 
was identified as a paralegal-not a legal assistant-and the tasks she performed included drafting 
pleadings. See Matter of Estate of Benjamin, 70 V.I. at 117-18. Here, Ms. Betz's tasks are entirely 
clerical, such as assisting with copying and filing documents, and should be excluded. See Gov't 
Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 40-49); see also Crown Bay Marina, L.P., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129178, at *6 
(citing Jordan v. SEPTA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42123, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 26, 2013) ("Purely 
clerical or secretarial tasks should not be billed at a paralegal rate ... ").

CONCLUSION 
For all the reasons set forth, the Court should deny the Epstein Estate's Motion for Award 
of Attorneys' Fees. Alternatively, the Court should exclude the billing entries the Government 
identifies herein and in Government Exhibit 2 and reduce counsel's hourly rate to a maximum rate 
of $350 per hour.
