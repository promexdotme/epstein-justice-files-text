I shared your latest email with Mr. McAuliffe and we both agree that it is our position that he needs to honor his 
commitment and complete his community control as agreed. If you feel it necessary to file a motion to modify or 
early terminate on behalf of your client just let me know so I can have enough time to get the Det. and victims 
notified so they can appear for the hearing. Thanks!

It is obvious you have spent a lot oftime on my request for my client and I sincerely appreciate the 
thoroughness and the attention. As my clients case seems to lend itself to misunderstandings and 
miscommunications by others, I thought it important to clarify some facts assumed in error. 
I have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the following: Yes termination of supervision on a 
sex offender is unusual, however a modification to probation from Community control is not uncommon when 
the probationer has been in compliance without violation. In fact the department's current policy on re-entry 
to the community dictates that an offender be stepped down as soon as possible. He was also under the 
misimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein's charges called for sex offender probation. They do 
not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues in my clients case, sterile questions that may 
have been asked tend to lead to answers that though well meaning are not applicable. 
As for the timeliness of the police reports of the attempted breakins, I wanted you to be aware that I confirmed 
with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to the captain on duty, there should be a 
record. I said to you it was my advice to the client that he not file a formal report. 
You have suggested that to resolve all the issues my client move to transfer his community control and that 
your office would support his transfer. I appreciate that and spoke to Mr. Gaines about that and he doesn't 
believe that would be possible to New York. Mr. Gaines suggested an agreement to allow Mr. Epstein to travel 
for business purposes without the present 48 hour limitation but strictly at the discretion and with the 
approval of probation for the remaining short portion of his supervision would be appropriate. He advised me 
that the department would not object to such a modification. This to me is the fairest way to deal with the 
issues, and to insure Mr. Epstein is treated like others, Let me know and I can prepare some proposed 
language that I think would work for everyone

This dragon just keeps raising its ugly head! 
May I tell him to just file his motion to 
modify with the Court? 
I don't know how to convey to him anymore than I already have that 
his client is a registered sex offender that was fortunate to get the deal of the century, 
fortunate enough, even as a sex offender, to be granted work release while serving his 
jail sentences (I am not aware of that ever happening before) and certainly fortunate to 
plea at a time when it was not required by statute that he be placed on sex offender 
probation with all of the restrictive conditions that the vast majority of individuals in 
his similar situation would have been subjected to. 
Please advise.

As per your request I am forwarding the following summary: 
Re: The Burglary/Attempted Burglary allegations, the Palm Beach PD were surprised to hear this and indicated 
that there has never been such complaint(s) since Epstein was place on Community Control. I spoke further with 
Jack Goldberger and he indicated that Epstein employs private security through Wackenhut and they intercepted 
this person who was dressed in black like a Ninja and hiding in some bushes. They chased him to a dark 
Chrysler 300 and took down the tag info. From there they were able to find out that it was registered to a Pl that 
has been associated/linked to Atty. Rothstein and the Gambino family. I spoke with DOC Community Control 
Supervisor, Ofc. Gaines, and he advised me that late last week Epstein informed him of a similar incident. Ofc. 
Gaines went on to say that he spoke with Epstein in late Sept. or possibly Oct. of last year and explained to him 
that he received "the best deal ever heard of for someone in his situation" and that he warned him to follow every 
condition by the letter so as not to get violated. If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which 
would be even more of a restriction to him. 
Re: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8 ½ yrs. of 
doing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no known case where a Sex Offender on 
Community Control has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or 
DOC. There have been rare instances where a person who has been on a very long probation has been given 
early termination of probation after serving a considerable number of years on probation. 
Re: The position of the U.S. Attorney's office on early termination of the State's case against Epstein, I again 
spoke with AUSA Villafana and inquired specifically of any knowledge that she had in reference to 
representations made by her or anyone associated with her office regarding Epstein's efforts to early term his 
Community Control on the State charges. She indicated that she had not made any such representations 
however her boss, interim U.S. Atty. Sloman may have. After checking she sent me a portion of the last letter 
sent to Epstein's attorneys. I have forwarded that to you by attachment. 
Please let me know ifthere is anything else that I can provide to you.

Hi Barbara - Here is the relevant portion of the last letter to JE' s attorneys regarding the termination of 
superv1s1on: 
In light of Mr. Acosta's prior statements to Mr. Epstein's counsel that Mr. Epstein would be 
eligible for any benefit available to other similarly-situated state defendants, the Office agrees that Mr. 
Epstein may apply for early termination or modification of community control in accordance with Fl. 
Stat.§§ 948.05 and 948.10(4), assuming that Mr. Epstein has completed "the sanctions imposed in the 
community control plan." The Office takes no position regarding such an application; it is entirely 
within the discretion of the State Attorney's Office and the Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge as to 
whether it is in "the best interests of justice and the welfare of society" to allow Mr. Epstein to 
terminate prematurely his community control. Mr. Epstein and his counsel may not make a

representation to the State Attorney's Office, the Court, or any victim that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
agrees with, joins in, or does not oppose such a motion. In light of prior erroneous statements in court 
filings, we respectfully request that a copy of any court filing be provided to our office. 
If such a motion is made, in accordance with your proposal, the U.S. Attorney's Office will notify 
the federal victims that the application was filed and, if a hearing is scheduled, the date, time, and 
location of such hearing. The communication will consist merely of a notification and will neither 
encourage nor discourage attendance or submission of materials related to the application.

RE: 
State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein 
Case No. 2008CF009381A 
Dear Barbara, 
PA. 
·•·· JOSEPH R.ATTERBURY

* JASON S. WEISS 
Board Certified Criminal Trial Attorney 
Member of New Jersey & Florida Bars 
Pursuant to our telephone conversation of November 30, 2009 and your subsequent email 
to me, I am providing the following information to you concerning Jeffrey Epstein's air travel 
from May 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009. 
As you know, Mr. Epstein was in the custody of the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office 
until July 22, 2009. I have confirmed that since Mr. Epstein's release from custody, he has 
traveled twice by air. The first trip was on September 14, 2009 when he traveled by 
helicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach 
County by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only 
other passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by 
probation. On August 27, 2009 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to 
Sikorsky Helicopters in northern Pa!m Beach County. LarryVisoski and Nadia Marcinkova 
accompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of 
transportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights 
taken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. I am told there are not flight logs kept for the 
helicopter but I am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another 
document confirming the September 14, 2009 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. I am 
also enclosing documents for the August 27, 2009 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters. 
On another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State 
Attorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of 
his probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with 
probation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. I note that many 
of the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scott Rothstein law

firm which has since filed bankruptcy as a result of massive fraud by one of its partners. 
It is alleged that they used their civil cases filed against Mr. Epstein as one of their more 
lucrative devices to perpetrate this fraud. Based on what I have learned and read, there 
have been false filings, forged judge's signatures, and forged Eleventh Circuit Opinions. 
It is also possible that other third parties have engaged in this conduct by falsely alleging 
Mr. Epstein has violated the terms of his probation. 
With this in mind, It appears that Mr. Epstein could be a victim of fabricated attacks 
designed to do nothing more than question his compliance with his probation and 
community control requirements. I truly want my client, as I am sure you do, to complete 
his probation without continued false accusations being made against him. 
I would 
suggest a meeting so we may discuss these problems. Given the fact that false 
accusations are being made against my client, I would take the unusual step of producing 
my client for such a meeting if you think it would be helpful. 
Please give me a call with your thoughts on this and whether those documents satisfy your 
request.

OUR FILENO.: 080303 
Dear Ms. Hackett, 
As we discussed. J have agreed to cancel the deposition of ASA Daliah Weiss at this time. 
Based on the conversations with Ms. Weiss and you, I do not foresee the need at this time to 
reset this deposition, but I cannot completely foreclose the possibility of deposition in the future 
pending further discovery in the Epstein cases. As I mentioned to you, if r believe there is 
additional infonnation that develops in these cases that would require me to reset Mrs. Weiss for 
deposition. I will provide you with notice prior resening this deposition so that you will have an 
oppornmity to address the court in a timely manner. 
Should you have any additional questions please do not hesilate to contact me at your 
converuence.

Dear Lanna Belohlavek, 
I am at a lost K-r words, and trying to hold the tears back, after rea mg a out t e 
sickening details of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's case. I have to say in this instance, your 
office along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not 
adequately punishing a chronic child molester a ... d rapist. This man of wealth and 
prestige preyed on innocent, poor, GJRLS and systematically raped them at his wi11. He 
lived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the 
corrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be 
facing the death penalty. How can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of 
girls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and now be a free man?! How?!! Because he is 
rich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these 
girls makes me sick. Now, I understand the pressure of taking on a powerful person with 
unlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is better than 
none can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor 
did you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your 
office could have put this monster away for at least 20 years, if not life. 
I'm sure you have read Conchitta Sarnoff's piece on the Daily Beast detailing this 
monsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as 
a cautionary tale on how not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Now, 
I do not know the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, how much hush· 
money was paid out, ect ect. But I do know that aftc:r people such as Jeffery Epstein have 
raped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn't be allowed to do the 
same thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you 
legally could have to put this man in prison. However after researching the case, it seems 
you failed to come down with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA's 
office and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good! 
It would do our s0<;iety much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the 
justice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose 
to defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your little sister 
or daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American 
people deserve better, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the 
anger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the 
whole DA's office neerl to know this- that monster doesn't deserve freedom!

INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM 
TO: Chief Michael Waites 
FROM: Investigator Glenn Wescott 
RE: State Attorney's Investigation 09-002456 
DATE: August 24, 2009 
***************************************************************** 
On 08/21/09 I was assigned to obtain copies of the security 
cameras and log in sheets for 1 Clearlake Plaza in West Palm 
Beach, FL which is the business address for Jeffrey Epstein. On 
08/21/09 I received the copies of the log in sheet and noted that 
Mr. Epstein's name does not appear on the log in sheet which he 
would only be required to do if he were in the building after 
1900 per the Property Manager, Mrs. Michelle Horn. 
On 08/24/09 I received the security camera videos which were 
formatted to DVD. I could not discern Mr. Epstein on the CD's but 
the camera angle is poor and does not allow one to see the entire 
area, just the door area. 
The DVD's and Log In Sheets were TOT ASA Burns per her 
request.

MEMORANDUM 
TO: 
The File 
VIA: 
Direct 
FROM: 
Capt. George Frick 
RE: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
·,. 
~-
DATE: 
08/20/09 
On 8/19/09, at approximately 1635 hours, I was advised that Jeffrey Epstein was 
walking northbound on South Ocean Blvd in the area of Brazilian Avenue. Based on 
my prior conversations with Probation Supervisor Gladstone, I made contact with him to 
discuss the possibility that this was a violation of Epstein's order of community control. 
I made contact with Gladstone who advised in his opinion that this was a violation and 
that based on FSS 948.06, we should arrested Epstein. I advised Gladstone that I 
needed a copy of his Order of Community Control in hand prior to making this arrest. 
At 1642, this order was e-mailed to my office computer. I reviewed and printed the 
order and responded to the area. At approximately 1653, I observed Epstein walking 
southbound on South Ocean Blvd near the intersection of Barton Avenue. At 1655 I 
requested a marked unit respond to Clarke Avenue and South Ocean Blvd as I was 
making contact with Epstein. Epstein was wearing dark sweat pants and a white t-shirt. 
He was sweating profusely. As he approached, I identified myself and began my on-
scene investigation. This was documented in the CAD system, CAD #092310146, 
attached. 
At that time, Epstein advised that his probation officer, Carmen Sloan, had advised him 
he was allowed to walk to and from work, and that he was now en-route to work. He 
further advised that his work address was on Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach. I 
questioned Epstein as to why he was not on a direct route to his work, and why he was 
now walking south when he had just been walking north. He stated that he had walked 
to the area of the North Bridge, but considered it too busy, therefore he was returning to 
the Middle Bridge to cross into West Palm Beach.

TO: Chief Michael Waites 
FROM: Investigator Glenn Wescott 
RE: State Attorney's Investigation 09-002456 
DATE: August 24, 2009 
***************************************************************** 
On 08/21/09 I was assigned to obtain copies of the security 
cameras and log in sheets for 1 Clearlake Plaza in West Palm 
Beach, FL which is the business address for Jeffrey Epstein. On 
08/21/09 I received the copies of the log in sheet and noted that 
Mr. Epstein's name does not appear on the log in sheet which he 
would only be required to do if he were in the building after 
1900 per the Property Manager, Mrs. Michelle Horn. 
On 08/24/09 I received the security camera videos which were 
formatted to DVD. I could not discern Mr. Epstein on the CD's but 
the camera angle is poor and does not allow one to see the entire 
area, just the door area. 
The DVD's and Log In Sheets were TOT ASA Burns per her 
request.

MEMORANDUM 
DATE: 
December 20, 2006 
FROM: 
Gerald B. Lefcourt 
Sheryl E. Reich 
Faith A. Friedman 
TO: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
FILE 
SUBJECT: 
Impeachment Material 
LAW OFFICES OF 
GERALD B. LEFCOURT, P.C. 
(212) 737-0400 
Set forth below is some of the information that demonstrates (a) that the Palm 
Beach Police Department ("PBPD") made a materially incomplete and materially 
inaccurate presentation of the facts in both the probable cause affidavit and in its release 
to the public of the Police Reports, and (b) why the State Attorney's decision to proceed 
as it did with respect to the bringing of any charges against Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") 
was not inappropriate. 1 Note, though the Police Reports are on various dates, since they 
were released to the public with continuous pagination, we refer here simply to the 
"Police Report" and use the numbering provided in the version disclosed to the public. 
I. Inaccuracies and Material Omissions from the Police Reports 
1. 
Polygraph Examination and Report. On May 2, 2006, Epstein submitted to 
a polygraph examination in which he was asked (a) whether he had "s. 
contact with 
(b) whether he "in anyway threaten[ ed] 
-
( c) whether he was told by 
"that she was 18 years 
old"; and (d) whether he "believed 
as 18 years old". As set 
forth in the Report of the examination, t e term sexual contact" was given an 
extremely broad meaning in order to capture any inappropriate conduct that 
could have occurred. 2 The results of the examination confirmed that ( a) no 
such conduct occurred; (b) Epstein never threatened -
told Epstein she was 18 years old; and ( d) Epstein believed ~ 
1 This memo is not exhaustive of facts of which the defense is aware. Nor is it exhaustive of 
Epstein's defenses to the accusations. 
2 The definition included: "sexual intercourse, oral sex acts (penis in mouth or mouth on vagina), 
finger penetration of the vagina, finger penetration of the anus, touching of the vagina for sexual 
gratification purposes, touching of the penis for sexual gratification purposes, masturbation by or 
to another, touching or rubbing of the breasts, or any other physical contact involving sexual 
thoughts and/or desires with another person". 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
years old. Though the results of the examination were given to the PBPD and 
the PBPD was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner in 
order to satisfy itself as to the bona fides of the exam, representatives of the 
PBPD inexplicably declined to attend the meeting and no information 
concerning the fact of the exam or the results appeared in the Police Report; 
the probable cause affidavit; or the public release. 
2. 
Meetings with the State Attornev's Office. On multiple occasions, defense 
counsel met with prosecutors and investigators in the State Attorney's Office. 
Though there is vague reference to one or more meetings with defense counsel 
(see, e.g., pages 64 and 87 of the Police Report), virtually no information 
provided or evidence from witnesses proffered is included in the Police 
Report or probable cause affidavit. Instead, there are misleading or false 
references to such meetings. So, for example, at page 64 of the Police Report, 
Det. Recarey claims he attempted to reach ASA Dahlia Weiss on December 
20, 2005, but she was unavailable that day and for the entire week. In fact, on 
December 19, 2005, Det. Recarey met with ASA Weiss and Epstein defense 
attorney Alan Dershowitz - a meeting at which Dershowitz provided evidence 
impeaching 
(see below). This evidence included excerpts 
from -
MySpace.com webpage, which is not only unnoted in the Police 
Report, but credited as having been found by Det. Recarey. (Police Report at 
page 65.) In another example, the briefest reference is made to a conversation 
Det. Recarey had on June 1, 2006, with ASA Belohlavek regarding a meeting 
earlier that day between representatives of the State Attorney's Office and 
defense attorney Jack Goldberger (Police Report at page 87). Omitted are the 
facts of the meeting (Report at 87): In addition to the presence of other 
defense counsel, there was in attendance both the polygraph expert who 
administered the examination and a psychiatrist who had performed a rigorous 
psycho-sexual evaluation of Epstein and who concluded that Epstein was 
healthy. Both men were made available for questioning by the State Attorney 
and the PBPD; unfortunately, the PBPD failed to attend the meeting. Nor is 
there any mention of the presentat~
ense counsel in which the 
claims being made with respect to-
(by then, the sole focus of 
any potential prosecution) were rebutted. 
3. 
The Video Surveillance Equipment Located in Epstein's Office and 
Garage. Both the Police Report (page 43) and the probable cause affidavit 
(page 18) make particular mention of the PBPD having "discovered" video 
surveillance equipment, or "covert (hidden) cameras" (as the PBPD refers to 
them), at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, specifically in Epstein's garage and 
library/office. By its placement in the probable cause affidavit, it is clear that 
the reader is intended to assume a link between this equipment and "sex 
objects" and that the cameras were used for an improper purpose. As the 
probable cause affidavit states: Det. Recarey "located a wood colored armoire 
beside Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of 'joy jelly', which is used to 
provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the 
second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's 
bedroom ... " Indeed, much is made of the presence of this equipment, noting 
2 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
that it captured images of~
d others. (See probable cause 
affidavit at page 18). In particular, the probable cause affidavit notes that "on 
the first floor of the Epstein residence ... [was] found two covert cameras 
hidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the 
library area behind Epstein's computer .... the computer's hard drive was 
reviewed which showed several images o~ 
and other witnesses 
interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera 
positioned behind Epstein's desk". (Id.) Omitted from the Police Report and 
the probable cause affidavit is the fact that the PBPD had known since 2003 
about the presence of the cameras, and the specific reason for their installation. 
The cameras were installed in 2003 after Epstein discovered that large sums of 
cash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras 
installed at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided 
equipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the installation of the 
equipment Epstein purchased. The cameras ultimately served their purpose 
and captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from 
Epstein's briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of 
Alessi was turned over to the PBPD - indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The 
characterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as 
playing a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein's home (even though 
none of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever 
placed any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading 
and suggests an intention to portray the facts to suit a particular goal. 
4. 
Broken "Sex Toys" in Epstein's Trash. The Police Report details police 
finding in Epstein's trash what is described as pieces of "sex toys" and that 
these "discoveries" purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omitted from 
both the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is the fact that during 
the course of executing the search warrant on Epstein's home, the police 
realized that a key "sex toy" was in fact the broken handle of a salad server. 
Though the "sex toys" play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable 
cause affidavit, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery 
of this new and highly relevant evidence. 
5. 
Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other 
exculpatory and impeaching evidence known by the PBPD was omitted from 
the Police Report and probable cause affidavit by, in our view, manipulating 
the date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police 
Report (at page 85), Det. Recarey "explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the 
PBPD had concluded its case in December of 2005". That assertion, which is 
false, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced 
subsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains 
information obtained after December 2005, the PBPD escaped having to 
consider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause affidavit, 
or what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence 
presented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December 
2005. That evidence is listed below. 
3 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
II. 
Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses 
Relied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits. 
Virtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable 
cause affidavit has a background that casts significant doubt on whether the 
witness is sufficiently credible to support a finding of probable cause, let alone to 
sustain what would be the State's burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the 
witnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which 
undercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence 
was submitted to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the 
probable cause affidavit, or released to the public. Below we address solely the 
omitted criminal histories. Following that, we list other factors that make each 
witness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at 
trial - all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omitted from the 
Police Report, the probable cause affidavit and the public disclosure. 
6. 
Juan Alessi: While the Police Report (at page 57) and the probable cause 
affidavit (at page 21) contain assertions by Alessi which allegedly support the 
bringing of criminal charges, omitted is the evidence revealing Alessi' s 
evident mental instability; prior criminal conduct against Epstein; and bias 
towards Epstein. As the PBPD well knew, in 2003, Alessi was filmed taking 
money from Epstein's home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully 
entering Epstein's home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admitted to 
the PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions, 
stealing cash and attempting to steal Epstein's licensed handgun (which in fact 
went missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report 
detailing Alessi's confession. Also known to the PBPD, but omitted from the 
Police Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to 
kill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination 
of credibility, and was specifically known to Det. Recarey at the time the 
Police Report and probable cause affidavits were written, it was omitted. 
7. 
While the Police Report and robable cause affidavit rely 
the father o 
omitted is 
evidence, known to the PBPD, that casts doubt on 
credibility and 
sustainability as a witness. Omitted from the Police Report and probable 
cause affidavit is 
ederal fraud conviction, which defense 
investigators discovered and turned over to the PBPD during the course of the 
investigation. ~
erved 21 months in federal prison for his offense. 
8. 
While the Police Report and probable cause affidavit rely on 
statements of 
the step-mother of 
omitted is 
evidence, known to the PBPD that casts doubt on her credibility. Omitted 
from the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is-
state 
conviction for identity fraud - criminal use of identification information. This 
information, uncovered by defense investigators, was also turned over to the 
PBPD during the course of the investigation.

was the source of the vast majority of the 
allegations made about Epstein. While the Police Report and probable cause 
affidavit rely on-
numerous assertions, all but omitted is any reference to 
the facts known about her by the PBPD, specifically, that at the time 
was 
making these assertions 
10. 
-
ile the Police Report and probable cause affidavit 
contam numerous assertions of-
omitted is reference to her 
long history of contacts with la~
·Among those are multiple 
runaway complaints by her parents and her assignment to a special high 
school for drug abusers. 
In addition to the prior criminal history of each of these critical witnesses, all of 
which was omitted from the Police Report and probable cause affidavit, significant 
additional material information concerning the credibility of these key witnesses was 
provided to the PBPD but never included in the Police Report, the probable cause 
affidavit or the public release. 
11. 
"came forward" (as the probable 
cause affidavit characterizes it at pages 10-11 ), claiming she had knowledge 
of "sexual activity taking place" at Epstein's residence and misconduct by 
Epstein. Thus, it becomes clear thatlllllllllissertions of misconduct by 
Epstein were likely motivated by a strong desire to avoid the repercussions of 
her 
, which should have been taken into account when 
assessing her credibility as a witness. 
12. 
-
Was 18 at the Time She Inaccuratelv Alleges to Have 
Engaged in Sexual Conduct with Epstein. Epstein denies he ever had sex 
with -
However, even if he did, irrefutable evidence, in the form of a 
credit card receipt, was presented to the PBPD and the State Attorney's Office 
which demonstrates that any such encounters occurred at a time when Ill 
was already 18 years of age. (Indeed, it is our understanding that it was this 
information, combined with the character and credibility problems presented 
by the facts noted herein, that led the State Attorney's Office to conclude that 
~
as neither credible nor a proper complainant.) This information, though 
~
n to the PBPD, was omitted from the Police Report, the probable cause 
affidavit and the public release. 
13. 
Steals From a 
An investigation by 
private investigators working for the defense revealed that in late 2005-

was employed at a 
in Florida. On October 28, 2005, 
some three days aft 
was caught by a 
manager asllllattempte 
eave t e store wit mere an ise in he~
e, 
the security tag still attached. (According to a report of the incident_..,as 
found "kneeling on the floor digging through her purse". As the manager 
approached,-
'pulled out a pair of black SLT panties that had the sensor 
on them".) Seeing the manager, .
claimed "someone is trying to set me 
up". Following an internal investigation, which disclosed additional thefts 
from both the store and a customer, she was fired. (In addition to the theft 
above, she was seen by co-workers with store merchandise in her car; she was 
believed to have engaged in a fraudulent "return scheme"; and she obtained a 
pair of shoes from another store in the same mall by exchanging them for a

Juan Alessi Admitted Burglarizing Epstein's Home and Mental Health 
Issues. As touched on above, in 2003, Epstein noticed that significant 
amounts of cash were missing from his Palm Beach residence. In an effort to 
identify the thief, Epstein had video surveillance equipment installed in the 
library/office and garage. Caught on tape was former employee Juan Alessi 
breaking in and stealing cash. The video evidence was turned over to none 
other than PBPD Det. Recarey. After being confronted, Alessi admitted to 
that break-in and claimed he was suicidal and wanted to steal a gun (which 
Epstein maintained a license and permit for) with which he could kill himself. 
He took cash instead. However, Alessi also admitted that he had repeatedly 
entered the home unlawfully in order to steal money. Although these facts 
were known to the PBPD, and in particular by Det. Recarey, Alessi's criminal 
history and evident mental instability were not included in the Police Report 
or the probable cause affidavit or released to the public.

Juan Alessi Lied. Alessi is significant, of course, because the Police Report 
includes a statement by Alessi that "the bed would almost always have to be 
made after the massage[s]" (at page 57). The implication being that Epstein 
(and presumably the masseuse) used the bed during the massages. Though the 
Police Report is devoid of any accusation by any woman that any activity ever 
occurred on the bed, no evidence concerning Alessi' s motive to lie, his

Hi Barry -1 just left a voicemajl for Claudette, but figured I would send this to you, too. Our plea negotiations are 
not going very well, and I have given the defense a deadline of tomorrow afternoon to provide me with a signed 
agreement. If we cannot reach such an agreement, then I need to indict the case on Tuesday and I will not budge 
from that date. During my last phone call with defense counsel, he told me that they have changed their minds 
again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not concurrent state and federal. I said that is fine, but we will 
need a signed non-prosecution agreement (between the defense and us) by tomorrow afternoon, and an agreement 
at least verbally worked out with your office by Monday. I just think that Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts 
about spending time in jail and paying damages to the girls. I know you are out tomorrow, but if sometlting comes 
up, I will call Claudette and e-mail you. Thanks.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
Jeffrey Epstein is a person who, having been raised in modest, lower middle 
class circumstances in New York City, parlayed an aptitude for Mathematics, a 
teaching experience in a private school, and a chance referral to a Wall Street 
executive into a unique, niche business to the wealthy which in turn has made him a 
wealthy person. 
While this represents Jeffrey's outward achievement in life, it is 
hardly the measure of the man. To those who have known him long or intimately, he is 
a loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. 
To those in the 
scientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his 
largesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and mnst 
importantly, to those who work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary 
citizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding 
person, mentor, andftiend. 
Personal History 
Jeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in 
1953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was 
raised in modest lower middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish 
neighborhood: Jeffrey's father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City 
Parks Department. Jeflrey' s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in 
high school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeflrey recalled that, during· 
his youth, the family often played a card game called "Concentration" for entertainment 
from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a 
normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure. 
Jeffrey attended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident 
early on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. 188 and was subsequently placed in a special 
program which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High 
School. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayette High 
School in 1969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey 
attended Cooper Union in Manhattan for two years where he studied Math and Physics. 
Jeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York 
University. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for 
spending money. 
1 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
Around 1974, Jeffrey decided to try his hand at teaching and obtained a teaching 
position in mathematics with an annual salary of $12,000 at the Dalton School, a highly 
respected private school in uptown Manhattan which caters to the wealthy. Children in 
his classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of 
wealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been 
exposed. 
As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and 
uniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As 
matters would turn out, Jeffrey's experience at the Dalton School would become life-
altering on a number of different levels. 
As Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to attend an art 
gallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached 
by a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially 
talented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working 
on Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even know where Wall Street 
was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns. 
During his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admitted that he did not 
know what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea 
change in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively 
based valuation. Based on Jeffrey's mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a 
job on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year. 
Jeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader, 
and came to know a number of successful investors. His success in the position is 
reflected in the fact that by 1980 he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm. 
Believing, however, that he could do better on his own on the outside, he decided to 
resign from Bear Stearns in 1981. Capitalizing on his knowledge of and experience 
investing in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to 
the unique family and financial problems of the "hyper-rich" gained from his experience 
at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein & 
Company (now Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the 
"hyper-rich." The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice ( on 
investment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the 
2 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
client's family office. 
The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive: 
extreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor, 
i.e., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied 
families possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process, 
insulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members 
affected by the decisions of the family head. 1 In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential 
clients the scenario of "no longer having to worry about their money." Jeffrey continues 
in this unique "niche" business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey's 
business and personal interests currently employ approximately 160 people. Of these, 
however, he is the only income-producing person. 
Jeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied 
away from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allow him 
the kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey 
has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from 1981 to 1990, 
and the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from 1991 to 2000. (These will be treated in 
greater detail below.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West 
Palm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he 
was enrolled as a visiting fellow at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. 
Jeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He 
has preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy 
and well-known people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2005, Jeffrey agreed to 
accompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to 
Africa. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that 
it did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey's profile in the media and 
otherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live. 
1Jeffrey offered the following example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the 
difficulty of knowing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is 
called for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the 
implicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client, 
however, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would inc11r 
and absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.

Personal Characteristics 
Friendships. 
Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close 
relationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of 
these friends attest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always 
accorded them. 
Kathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follows: 
It's difficult to express how much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me 
over the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian 
angel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the 
stresses of his own work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to 
me with gentleness, wisdom and humor. 
I've watched Jeffrey grow from boyhood into one of the hardest working, 
responsible, and generous men I know. For instance, when the time came 
to send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible 
education but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I 
couldn 't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood 
how much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the 
costs of our son 's education. This past June, our son graduated from 
Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible 
without Jeffrey's long term commitment and generosity. 
Terry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has known Jeffrey since 
1958, wrote: 
From the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was 
always in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently 
call upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he 
was doing to listen and help . ... 
I am aware of Jeffrey 's contributions to charitable causes and programs. 
that he believes will make a difference to mankind and society - many of 
which are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can attest that he 
is also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when 
he spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my 19 year old son Philip 
to help him sort out academic problems he was having. 
Warren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from 
Jeffrey's youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days, 
including the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer 
4 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which attests to the playful side of 
Jeffrey's nature: 
In high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were 
jokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just 
didn't take the class seriously. One month before graduation, our phys-ed 
teacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were 
"two smart boys", we would not graduate because we would get a failing 
grade in phys-ed We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it 
was too late. 
After 10 minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff 
convinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until 
graduation. Well, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class 
every day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the 
class did ... including track. 
Our gym teacher gave us "C" and we 
graduated. 
Eisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the 
following words: 
Over the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success 
unattainable by anyone I've ever met. No matter how busy he ever is, no 
matter where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff, 
he was always there. As we 've gotten older, our lives have become more 
complicated, • but we have never missed calling each other on our 
birthdays. It's a small, silly thing, but how many childhood friends do you 
know, who have never forgotten your birthday? The most important thing 
to me is that as vast a difference [ as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep 
seated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have; 
it's just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even 
family. People who are fortunate to have these kind of .frie,uls are the only 
ones who could comprehend this special relationship. 
Jeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his 
adulthood. In about 1981, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (now Andersson-Dubin), then 20, 
who was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still 
enduring friendship. 
The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one. 
During that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He 
encouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She 
reported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with 
her studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to 
cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and 
presently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist. 
5 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
When it became clear, however, that the demands of Jeffrey's life could not 
include staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no 
future as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three 
children. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly 
every day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so 
in the 26 years they have known each other. She described their current relationship as 
follows: 
Today [Jeffeey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is 
the godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as 
well. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the 
evening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and 
conduct science Q & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the 
children's birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational 
games for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey 
was extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could 
not ask for a better friend or godfather to my children. 
Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, 12. Celina wrote 
glowingly of their weekly science lesson when "Uncle Jeff," as she calls him, takes time 
from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science 
and mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for 
example, as why the sky is blue or how fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they 
then spend some time at the piano where "Uncle Jeff' helps her work on her singing 
voice (even though, as she knows, "Uncle Jeff' does not have any real expertise in this 
area). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, however, by an 
incident Celina related in her letter: 
One of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2 
years ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter 
dance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I 
didn't know what 1 would do because you had to bring your father to the 
dance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone 
call to Uncle Jeff didn't leave me standing there, alone for more than I 0 
minutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he 
rushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there. 
After Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey 
entered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning 
6 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
in 1991. Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of 
her life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-known publisher, had been found dead 
floating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers 
were involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they 
were eventually acquitted. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time. 
Ghislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. 
She found the friendship 
immediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation. 
Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period, 
and he never allowed her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical 
things he could do for her. He gave her books to read - good novels, scientific studies -
containing issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the 
process, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to 
comedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her 
depression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen 
into a deep depression. 
Jeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her 
get a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey's way of helping friends 
with his money is always with a view toward maintaining their dignity. He would never 
just give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to 
people he does not know, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to 
give it back. These gifts are meant to allow the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey 
finds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which 
she subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect. 
Over time, their relationship became intimate. However, as with Eva, it ended 
amicably around 2000 upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work, 
i.e., the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world, 
precluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this 
day. She wrote of their relationship: 
.My experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man, 
with a keen sense of humor and a ready smile - a man of principles and 
values and a man of his word If he made a promise, he would always 
follow through. 
In fact, I never saw him break a promise. 
He is 
7 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
disciplined in business and conscientious. A man always quick to help 
someone who is down, or to offer an opportunity to someone to pursue a 
dream or a goal. 
Generosity to Educational. Wellness, Civic and Scientific Organizations. Jeffrey 
has been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scientific 
organizations. Between 2000 and 2006 he donated personally, through his business and 
interests, and through foundations he had established,2 a total exceeding $16,000,000. 
The good generated by his largesse is suggested in the following examples. 
Jeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps 
none more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish 
community at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and 
religious life at the university. Toe fundraising campaign was having difficulties when 
Henry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach 
Jeffrey. Rosovsky wrote: 
At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift 
would allow him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a 
tempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity 
and the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details, 
but in essence this is what happened 
Jeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly 
did not want his name on the building. 
Leslie Wexner would also 
participate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had 
decided - by himself or jointly with Wexner - that my name should be on 
the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a 
long time. I.fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion 
and greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor 
but without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no 
building. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no 
new building and that would have been an enormous loss to the 
community. 
The building that now stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-
Radcliffe Hillel at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a 
noteworthy aspect of Jeffrey's giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his

gifts to be anonymous. Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the 
spotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected. 
Jeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the 
Institute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe 
haven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such 
places as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors 
over the last several years of the "Female Economist of the Year" award offered by the 
Stockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were 
the original sponsors and creators of "The Prize for Promise," a national award program 
designed to "identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance, 
courage, dedication, and vision'' to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of 
endeavor to make improvements in the world. 
Yet another example of Jeffrey's 
generosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former 
President Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the 
room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate 
degree in the . United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton 
Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New 
York where they are expected to graduate in 2008. 
Jeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness 
organizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer 
Research Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the 
Continuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and 
the Center for Health and Healing. 
Jeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in 
both New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a 
major contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in 
New York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty 
fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money 
to literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational, 
sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children's advocacy and 
women's groups. 
One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which 
9 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
in 2005 recognized Jeffrey's generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to attend 
the school who otherwise would not have been able to. 
Perhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey's philanthropy is his no-strings attached 
support of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting "bleeding edge" research. 
As previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in mathematics and science, 
and is particularly attracted to research which focuses on the mathematical foundation of 
life. By his own admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of 
such research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research 
financially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example 
of this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist 
who predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at 
the institute on what has become known as Chaos Theory. 
Another particular example is Martin A. Nowak, Ph.D., Director of the Program 
for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nowak recently wrote: 
Over the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work, 
which deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I 
have had many fruitful discussions with him. 
Often he would ask 
questions, which are surprising for me. 
Often I feel that none of my 
scientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too 
engaged in our own narrow perspective. 
Jeffrey's questions and 
proposals are highly original and always surprising. 
Many of his 
questions an.d ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For 
example, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which 
led me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that 
topic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks 
between people. The result was 'evolutionary graph theory', which is new 
field of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me 
complicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from 
chemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful 
and completely new research project. . .. 
Jeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. 
He has 
donated $500,000 to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where 
I have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from 1998 until 2003. In 
2003, Jeffrey donated $6,500,000 to Harvard University, where I work as 
Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of 
Mathematics and Biology. 
Both donations were meant to support my 
basic research work without any strings attached

Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that 
a particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey's history clearly 
reflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is 
quick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally 
those who work for him and those he knows. Once he learns of and determines through 
conversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee, 
treats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees 
to it that, without strings attached, the solution happens. 
The issues may be 
accommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family 
problems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to better 
himself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to 
address the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this 
capacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor. 
Examples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K. 
Indyke, general counsel to Jeffrey: 
Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the 
workman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman's sister-
in-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen 
of Colombia and the workman did not have the financial resources or 
know how to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey 
arranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law 
and sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law's visit 
to the United States. 
The surgery was a success and both patients 
recovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr. 
Epstein 's expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the 
high school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education 
is now being funded by Mr. Epstein. 
There have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for 
employees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several 
examples follow: 
A father of one of Jeffrey's employees in the Virgin Islands was recently 
diagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for 
the father's treatment and has given the employee financial support and 
complete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order 
to fly to Florida to attend to the employee's father. 
11 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
Lesley Groff, a personal assistant to Jeffrey, reported a number of 
accommodations Jeffrey has made, i.e., purchase of a vehicle for her 
commute, extended maternity leave, a reduced work week and permission 
to work from home, which have strengthened her family life. 
Lauren Kwintner, another New York City-based employee, told of 
accommodations from 2003 to 2005 that Jeffi-ey made for her to attend to 
her father, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, at both 
Sloane Kettering Memorial Hospital and subsequently the Hospital for 
Joint Diseases, until his passing. 
Bella Klein, also a New York City-based employee, was a single mother 
whose son was accepted to Cornell University; Jeffrey has paid up to 70% 
of his tuition expenses; the son now has his Master's Degree and· is 
working on his Ph.D. 
Harry Beller, a sixteen-year employee, is an orthodox Jew who is required 
to be home prior to sundown on Fridays and on all Jewish holidays. 
Jeffrey has always accommodated his religious commitments, on occasion 
permitting pressing Friday transactions to take place on the following 
Monday. Mr. Beller also told of Jeffrey's assistance in making available 
any of his contacts in the medical field and to take any necessary time off 
when one of his sons was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma. 
Jeffrey has been especially generous in funding the educational pursuits of his 
employees (and their family members) as a way of assisting them to better themselves 
and achieve their full potential. Mr. Indyke has written that over the last six years, 
Jeffrey has funded literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to many 
individuals (some of whom Jeffrey has no connection with whatsoever) from the pre-
school to the post-graduate levels. Mr. Beller, mentioned above, for example, has been 
the recipient of tuition assistance for all six of his children! Another employee, Emad 
Hanna, who was hired by Jeffrey at a particularly trying time of his adult life, told of 
Jeffrey's sponsorship of his son's AAU baseball team and of the tuition assistance for his 
son: 
Jeffrey Epstein has paid out of his pocket my son's high school tuition/or 
2 years now totaling around $20,000 and has given him the opportunity to 
get a top notch education at a private all boys catholic high school and my 
son has thrived in that environment and averaged a grade of 91 in his 
freshmen (~ year and from all the travel baseball experience he was 
able to make the JV baseball team at one of the top schools in New Jersey. 
This has paved the way for my son to possibly hav~ the opportunity to 
12 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
attend a college of his choice when the time comes. I would not have been 
able to [ do J this if it wasn 't for Mr. Epstein. 
Another example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is putting 
through vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke 
related that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and 
mentor Mr. Diaz. 
A final education example was related by David Lambert, ~ employee: 
While working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a 
relationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo 
and I reflect life's issues and family matters as best [ as] a Colombian and 
English speaking .friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture 
speaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken 
English and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter attending 
college. Alfredo told me how proud he is of her attending college. "Me 
daughter, she very, very happy. " I could see the emotion in his eyes which 
led to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically "... because, 
Mister Jeffrey. " After many such conversations with Alfredo it's clear to 
me he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the 
dream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such 
consequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one 
man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is 
aware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without 
thought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's 
crisis avoided, human suffering eliminated. 
Jeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to 
face and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings 
the same virtues, i.e., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and 
generosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke 
faced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length: 
Shortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and 
unexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned 
that I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional 
manner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to 
undergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we 
could not afford and which were not then covered by the company's 
medical insurance. 
I meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop 
my wife and me from the company's _medical policy in exchange for a 
13 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally 
asked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a 
moment's consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the 
bills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his 
generosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing 
news. 
In the days and weeks that followed, Jeffrey personally researched 
infertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. 
He 
identified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were 
seeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the 
progress of our treatment cycle. 
Unfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I 
were hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at 
his expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be 
terminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were 
devastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as .financial, 
support and encouraged us to proceed. When the third cycle failed and 
my wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me 
to go over my wife's and my options, which now included in-vitro 
fertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not 
blink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we 
were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private 
adoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey fonded, 
while we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense. 
At the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption 
attempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to 
continue. Without Jeffrey's support and stubborn daily encouragement we 
would not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, 
to meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas 
adoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after 
our fzfth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although 
Jeffrey was adamant that we owed him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by 
agreeing to be the godfather of our children. 
The bottom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably 
successfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous 
human being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but 
has been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with, 
educational institutions, "bleeding edge" scientific researchers, wellness organizations, 
and civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them 
14 

Public Records Request No. 19-372
address life problems and reach their potential; to enable educational, wellness, and civic 
organizations to better achieve their respective purposes; and, to foster the kind of 
scientific research which might potentially benefit all of mankind. 
Finally, in his 
generosity, Jeffrey has sought nothing for himself. To the extent it is possible, his giving 
has always been anonymous; when this has not been possible, it is clear that he does not 
seek the spotlight for these acts.
