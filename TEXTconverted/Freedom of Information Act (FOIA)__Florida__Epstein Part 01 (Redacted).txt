against minors, often pose a high risk of engaging in sexual offenses even after being released

who request such information, and the release of such information to the public by a taw 
enforcement agency or public agency, wilt further the governmental interests of public safety.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 15TH 
JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR PALM 
BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
Case No.: 502006CF009454AXXXMB 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
v. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
COMES NOW, Witness Y. Doe,' by and through undersigned counsel, 
respectfully moves for a protective order pursuant to Florida Rule Criminal Procedure 
3.220(1)(1), requiring that the deposition of Y. Doe be taken in this matter in conjunction 
with and at the same time with the deposition of Y. Doe in the civil case captioned Jane 
Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida. As grounds therefore, Witness Y. Doe 
states as follows: 
1. 
Y. Doe has been subpoenaed for deposition in this case by the Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein. The subpoena schedules the deposition for April 2, 2008. 
2. 
Y. Doe is a victim in this matter who alleges that she was sexually 
assaulted by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein when she was 16 years old. Y. Doe has brought a 
civil case against Defendant Epstein captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case 
' The witness is named here anonymously as "Y. Doe" because of the sensitive 
allegations of sex abuse upon a minor involved in this case. 
07/26/17
Page 37 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District 
of Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein. 
3. 
It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and 
issues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases. 
4. 
It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and 
necessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by 
Defendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and 
traumatic facts in separate depositions for each case. 
5. 
It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this 
case if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same 
time. 
6. 
Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220(1)(1) provides that the Court 
may issue a protective order "as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, 
unnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the 
deposition." Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(h)(1) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe's 
circumstances will only be subject to one deposition: "In any case, no person shall be 
deposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued 
on good cause shown." 
7. 
This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal 
case from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d 1338 (Fla. 1993); State v.  
Tarrago, 800 So.2d 300 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001). A requirement that a single deposition be 
taken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary 
emotional harm to Y. Doe. Finally, the taking of two separate depositions of Y. Doe by 
2 
07/26/17
Page 38 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

Defendant Epstein would be harassment. A protective order under rule 3.220(1)(1) would 
prevent this harassment. 
8. 	
Counsel for Witness Y. Doe has contacted both the attorneys for the State 
and for Defendant Epstein regarding this request, and neither has responded. 
WHEREFORE, Witness Y. Doe respectfully requests a protective order requiring 
that the deposition in the criminal case and the civil case captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v.  
Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for 
the Southern District of Florida, be taken at the same time, and for such further relief as 
this Court deems just and proper.

FLORIDA 
STATE OF FLORIDA 	
CASE NO: 2006 CF 009454 A 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
Defendant. 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
Jane Doe No. I ("Jane Doe"), by and through her mother and natural guardian, hereby 
files this Motion for Protective Order. As grounds for said motion, Jane Doe states as follows: 
1. 
On July 19, 2006 the State of Florida filed a criminal Indictment against Jeffrey 
Epstein ("Epstein"). 
2. 
Jane Doe, a victim of Epstein's actions, recently filed a civil lawsuit against 
Epstein. The complaint alleges among other things that Epstein has a sexual preference and 
obsession for underage minor girls. That he engaged in a scheme in which he gained access to 
minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Jane Doe was 
one of Epstein's victims. She was lured into Epstein's Palm Beach home under false pretenses 
and was sexually assaulted by Epstein. As a result, Jane Doe suffered injuries, including 
intentional infliction of emotional distress damages.

3. 
After the filing of the civil lawsuit and during the week of January 25, 2008, 
Epstein's criminal attorney, Jack Goldberger, Esq., contacted the undersigned to advise that he 
wished to take the deposition, in the criminal matter, of Jane Doe on February 6, 2008. The 
undersigned informed Mr. Goldberger that he would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, but 
was not available on February 6, 2008. Counsel agreed to use best efforts to schedule the 
deposition at a mutually convenient date and time. 
4. 
Despite these assurances and understanding, on Friday evening, February 1, 2008, 
Epstein's process server served Jane Doe at her place of work for a deposition scheduled to take 
place on February 6, 2008. I  See Subpeona attached as Exhibit "A" (Jane Doe's real name has 
been redacted from the exhibit). 
5. 
The undersigned was forced to call Mr. Goldberger on Friday evening and remind 
him of our earlier conversation and agreement and to insist that the deposition be re-noticed.2  
6. 
After the conversation of Friday evening and with the expressed assurances that 
the undersigned would accept service for Jane Doe, two days later on Monday morning February 
4, 2008, Mr. Goldberger had a process server serve Jane Doe's mother who resides out of state in 
Waleska, Georgia. See Subpoena attached as Exhibit "B" (Jane Doe's mother's name has been 
redacted from the exhibit). 
7. 
The service of process on Jane Doe's mother was defective as an Out of State 
Commissioner was never appointed and no order was issued by this court authorizing such 
service. Additionally, Mr. Goldberger had been told not once, but twice that the undersign would 
accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, yet despite this Epstein and/or his attorney has insisted on 
Mr. Goldberger unilaterally set Jane Doe's deposition for February 6, 2008 despite knowing that the undersigned 
was not available on that date. 
2 Mr. Goldberger has now agreed to postpone the deposition.

having the victim's privacy repeatedly intruded upon by process servers seeking her out at her 
employment and then again, intruding upon her mother. 
8. 
Additionally, during this same time period yet another adult male came to Jane 
Does' employment and represented himself as an "attorney" who needed to contract her. Upon 
information and belief that person was also an agent of Mr. Epstein's. 
9. 
It can only be concluded that Epstein and/or his counsel are purposefully 
attempting to harass Jane Doe and her mother. These actions are nothing more than a continuous 
insult to injury upon a young girl who has already been emotionally scarred for life. 
WHEREFORE, Jane Doe, by and through Jane Doe's mother and natural guardian, 
hereby move the Court for a Protective Order prohibiting Jeffrey Epstein and/or his counsel from 
continuous and systematic harassment. 
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was furnished by

minor. 
5. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State of New York. 
6. 
This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million. 
7. 
This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
8. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) as a substantial 
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations  
9. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
10. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one 
of his victims. 
11. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
12. 
An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach

Public Records Request No.: 17-295

Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
13. 
Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at 
Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, 
who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen 
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition 
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter 
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and 
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and 
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
14. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room 
with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He demanded that Jane remove her 
clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her 
underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane. 
15. 
After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought 
Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane 
to him. 
16. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. 
COUNT I 
Sexual Assault 
17. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats 
and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 above. 
18. 
Epstein tortiously assaulted Jane Doe sexually in or about 2005. 
19. 
This sexual assault was in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes, which 
recognizes as a crime the lewd and lascivious acts committed by Epstein upon Jane. 
20. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein's assault on Jane, she has suffered and will 
continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and 
emotional damages. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, 
demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein for compensatory damages, punitive damages, 
costs, and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

parents. 
25.

RE: 	
State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein 
Case No. 06-9454 CF A99 
Dear Ms. Belohlavek: 
Pursuant to the mandatory pretrial intervention provision of Florida Statute 796.07 this 
letter confirms the agreement reached between the parties on July 21, 2006, resolving the 
above referenced matter. 
Mr. Epstein will enter into a pretrial intervention agreement for a period of thirty six (36) 
months. The deferred prosecution and Mr. Epstein's participation in the Pretrial 
Intervention Program will terminate at the end of eighteen (18) months as long as Mr. 
Epstein has successfully completed the conditions of the Pretrial Intervention Program and 
there have not been any violations during that time. 
The conditions of the Pretrial Intervention Program are as follows: 
1. 
Mr. Epstein will refrain from any violation of the law. 
2. 
Mr. Epstein will pay the State of Florida $30.00 per month for the cost of the pretrial 
intervention agreement. 
3. 
Mr. Epstein will not change his current residences without the permission of his 
pretrial intervention officer. 
4. 
Mr. Epstein will not possess or carry any firearms. 
5. 
Mr. Epstein will truthfully answer all inquires by his pretrial intervention officer. 
6. 
Mr. Epstein will not use intoxicants to excess.

ly y urs, 
tr 
ack A. Goldberger 
7. 
Mr. Epstein will submit to any urinalysis, breathalyzer, blood tests, or any other 
testing requested by his pretrial intervention officer. 
8. 
Mr. Epstein, subject to the approval of the pretrial intervention agreement shall be 
permitted to report to his pretrial intervention officer by mail. 
9. 
As special conditions, Mr. Epstein agrees to be polygraphed by George Slattery & 
Associates at his own expense at intervals to be determined by the State Attorney's 
Office upon two weeks notice on any issue that the State Attorney's Office deems 
appropriate. These polygraph examinations will occur no more frequently than 
every two months. The results will be provided to the State Attorney's Office and 
will not be disclosed unless the State Attorney's Office determines that there has 
been a violation of the pretrial intervention agreement and the State Attorney's 
Office gives notice and consults with the defense before taking any action. 
10. 
As an additional special condition, at periodic intervals of six months, twelve 
months, and ten days prior to the termination of the pretrial intervention agreement, 
Mr. Epstein shall engage in sessions with Dr. Stephen Alexander at his own 
expense. Mr. Epstein specifically waives any privilege of confidentiality to the State 
Attorney's Office concerning the sessions. This waiver of confidentiality is limited 
to the State Attorney's Office. The results of the sessions with Dr. Alexander will not 
be disclosed unless the State Attorney's Office determines there has been a 
violation in the agreement and the State Attorney's Office gives notice and consults 
with the defense before taking any action. 
11. 
An additional special condition, Mr. Epstein will have no contact with specified 
individuals to be identified by the State Attorney's Office. 
Finally, Mr. Epstein will provide an admission that will be maintained in the State Attorney's 
Office file admitting that he knowingly, intentionally, and willfully solicited women for 
prostitution on three occasions as contained in the Indictment in Case No. 06-9454 CF 
A99. This admission will be provided to the State Attorney's Office to be used only in the 
unlikely event that there is a violation of the pretrial intervention agreement and the case 
is referred to the court system for prosecution. 
I believe this letter carefully and fully sets out the agreement reached at our meeting on 
Friday, July 21, 2006. If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
