UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 10-80309-MARRA/JOHNSON

Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
__________ / 
PLAINTIFF'S AGREED MOTION FOR FURTHER EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S AMENDED MOTION TO DISMISS 
COUNT VI AND FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT AND TO STRIKE 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 103, by and through her undersigned counsel, moves this Court for 
the entry of an order granting a further extension of time to file response to Defendant Epstein's 
Amended Motion to Dismiss Count VI and for More Definite Statement and to Strike [DE 15], on 
the following grounds: 
1. 
Plaintiffs response to Defendant Epstein's Amended Motion to Dismiss Count VI 
and for More Definite Statement and to Strike is presently due on May 13, 2010, pursuant to an 
earlier extension granted by the Court upon an agreed motion [DE 17]. 
2. 
The Parties are in the process of resolving this matter, and the subject motion and 
response will become moot. 
3. 
An extension of one week should be sufficient to allow the Parties time to complete 
the settlement process, including the filing of the Parties' Stipulation for Dismissal.
