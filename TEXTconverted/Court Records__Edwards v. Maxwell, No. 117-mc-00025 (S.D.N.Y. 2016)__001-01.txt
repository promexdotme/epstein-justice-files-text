10. 
I have received a subpoena to produce numerous documents in the Giuffre v. 
Maxwell case.  I am not a party to that case, but the attorney for the plaintiff, Ms. Giuffre. 
11. 
I was a party to a case styled Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz, 15-000072 
(17th Judicial District, Broward County, Florida).  The production at issue in that case 
spanned several thousand pages of documents.  Production from defendant Dershowitz came 
in several different stages, and various productions involved assertions of privilege.   
Production to defendant Dershowitz of documents and receipt of documents in that case was 
handled by my attorney.  While I have many of the documents that were produced or 
received, I did not maintain a separate file as I was merely a party in the litigation and did not 
keep records of the exact documents produced or received during that litigation.  Id.    
12. 
I am party in the case Epstein v. Edwards et al., Case No. 50-2009 CA 
040800XXXNMBAG (15th Judicial Circuit, West Palm Beach, Florida).  The case has been 
litigated for seven years.  A substantial number of documents are involved in the case.  Many 
of the subjects in the case overlap with subjects in the on-going Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 
v. United States case, as well as the now-closed Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz case.  
Because of this overlap, and because I was merely a party and not the primary attorney 
handling the Epstein v. Edwards case, I have not maintained a separate file for this matter nor 
have I segregated any materials for the Epstein v. Edwards case.  It would be an enormous 
burden and would be impossible to try and identify which discovery materials relate only to 
the Epstein v. Edwards case.   
13. 
Ghislaine Mawell is in a joint defense agreement with Jeffrey Epstein.  See 
Exhibit 5, answers to RFPs 6 and 7.

14. 
I am a counsel of record in the case of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United 
States, No. 9:08-cv-80736-MARRA (S.D. Fla.), along with co-counsel Paul G. Cassell.  We 
filed the case in July of 2008 and have been handling the matter ever since on a pro bono 
basis.   
15. 
Over the course of the nearly eight years of litigation in the case, the 
Government has produced correspondence between attorneys for Jeffrey Epstein and itself 
(i.e., the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and other components of 
the Justice Department).  That correspondence has been produced in multiple steps and 
amounts to hundreds of pages (if not thousands of pages) of material.   
16. 
Defendant Maxwell has sought any engagement letters between me and Ms. 
Giuffre in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, and production has been made.    
17. 
Defendant Maxwell has sought production of Ms. Giuffre’s joint defense 
agreement that pertains to the Giuffre v. Maxwell case.  On May 31, 2016, a copy of the joint 
defense agreement was provided to Ms. Maxwell as Exhibit 5 in support of Ms. Giuffre’s 
Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents. 
18. 
With regard to any work that I have done on behalf of a Florida not-for-profit 
corporation, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. (VRS), that would have been work as an attorney 
for my client Ms. Giuffre and would, accordingly, be protected by the attorney-client 
privilege, a privilege which is my client’s, not mine.   
19. 
My client, Ms. Giuffre, is a “person associated with Victims Refuse Silence, 
Inc.”   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 4 of 7

20. 
With waiving any privilege, any documents that might exist concerning 
disclosures made to me by Ms. Giuffre or consents provided to me by Ms. Giuffre would 
involve confidential attorney-client communications.   
21. 
I have been working on the CVRA case since July 2008.  That case clearly 
“relates” to Jeffrey Epstein, since the main issue in the case is challenging the legality of a 
non-prosecution agreement entered into by him and the Government without prior notice to 
Epstein’s victims. 
22. 
Between July 2008 and today, I estimate that I have received, at a minimum, 
more than 150,000 emails, and have sent, at a minimum, 60,000 emails.    
23. 
It would be significantly burdensome for me to have to review all of my 
emails to try and identify if I have had any “communications” with (for example) 
“journalists” that “related to” Virginia Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell, or Jeffrey Epstein.  It is 
not possible, on quick examination, to determine who is a journalist and who is not a 
journalist.  Moreover, because the CVRA case has continued for nearly eight years, more 
than 200,000 emails would have to be reviewed in multiple files for the relevant time period.   
I would then have to determine which of the emails were covered by, for example, work-
product protection.  A substantial burden would be involved in attempting to respond to the 
broad request for the subpoena, which would require numerous attorneys and staff to work 
countless hours to attempt to respond, and this too would likely prove to be impossible.  
24. 
Because I am attorney in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, I have had occasion to 
come into contact with both witnesses and potential witnesses in the case.  For example, I

have obviously had contact with my client in the case, Ms. Giuffre.  I have also had contact 
with other “potential witnesses” – since there are many potential witnesses in the case.
