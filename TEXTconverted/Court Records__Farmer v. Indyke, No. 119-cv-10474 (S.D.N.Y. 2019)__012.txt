ORDER 
19 Civ. 10474 (NRB) 
Non-party Alan Dershowitz ("Dershowitz") seeks permission to 
file a motion for limited intervention in order to move to strike 
the following allegation from plaintiff's complaint: 
"Among the 
guests that came to the mansion, Maria observed Alan Dershowitz, 
a lawyer, on a number of occasions, and observed that he would go 
upstairs at the same time the young girls were there." 
ECF No. 
1 
<]I 39. 
In the alternative, Dershowitz requests that the Court 
strike the allegation sua sponte. 
Having considered the several letters on this issue, see ECF 
Nos. 9-11, the Court exercises its authority, pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12 ( f) ( 1) , to strike sua sponte the 
aforementioned language. 
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (f) (1) 
(" [O]n its 
own," a court may "strike from a pleading an insufficient defense 
or 
any 
redundant, 
immaterial, 
impertinent, 
or 
scandalous 
matter."). 
The Court briefly addresses its reasons for doing so.

First, 
the allegation is neither material nor directly 
pertinent to any claim or defense in this action. 
Nor does Rule 
8 require plaintiff to plead credibility or to anticipate a 
response to a statute of limitations defense. 
Moreover, there 
already exists 
a 
forum 
for 
exploring 
the 
veracity 
of 
the 
allegation. 
See Giuffre v. Dershowitz, No. 19 Civ. 3377 (S .D.N. Y. 
Apr. 16, 2019), ECF No. 1-12. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
foregoing, 
the 
Court 
denies 
as 
moot 
Dershowitz's request for leave to submit a motion to intervene, 
which was requested solely for the purpose of moving to strike the 
language at issue. 1
