THIRD PARTY WITNESS, IGOR ZINOVIEW'S, 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LA ,v 
Third Paiiy Witness, Igor Zinoview's, ("Mr. Zinoview") by and through his 
undersigned attorney, moves this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a protective 
order regarding his deposition and as grounds therefore would state: 
1. 
As reflected on the affidavit of Igor Zinoview, attached as Exhibit A, he 
works for Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Mr. Epstein") as a driver and bodyguard. He did 
not know Mr. Epstein before November of 2005. He first became employed by Mr. 
Epstein in November of 2005. 
2. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview would testify as set forth on his affidavit, that 
at no time has he discussed with Mr. Epstein any issues involving Mr. Epstein's criminal 
case nor any of the cases or issues involved with civil plaintiffs. 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 2 of 26
3. 
In many of the depositions, counsel for L.M. and E.W., has asked them as 
witnesses to assume ce1iain facts about which they have no knowledge, and he then asks 
their opinions about certain facts. See Exhibit B ~Epstein's Motion for Protective Order 
to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions. 
4. 
There is no information which Mr. Zinoview has relating to the facts and 
circumstances surrounding any of the pending civil cases, in that none of their allegations 
directed to Mr. Epstein extend beyond September of 2005. 
Therefore whatever 
information Mr. Zinoview may have, postdates that time. 
5. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order (DE #377), "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, it 
is not without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 
1570 (11th Cir. 1992). . .. Cou1is have long held that ' [ w]hile the standard of relevancy 
[in discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear ge1111ane 
on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food & 
Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) (string 
cite omitted)." 
6. 
Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that, "[a] party or 
any person from whomn discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court 
where the action is pending.... The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect 
a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense, including one or more of the following: (A) forbidding the disclosure or 
discovery;". 
2 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 3 of 26
7. 
As set forth in his affidavit, Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action. Accordingly, the 
Court should enter a protective order prohibiting his deposition. 
WHEREFORE, third~paity witness moves this comt for a protective order 
pursuant to Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that his deposition not take 
place or the questioning be limited.

CASE NO. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
____________ ____;/ 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO 
PROHIBIT INAPPROPRIATE DEPOSITION QUESTIONS 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 1.280(c), Florida 
Rules of Civil Procedure, moves for a protective order to prohibit argumentative, 
harassing and inappropriate questions in depositions, and states: 
1. 
At numerous depositions, Plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly asked 
argumentative and harassing questions that are irrelevant and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
2. 
In particular, Plc;iintiff's counsel has asked questions that improperly 
sought to illicit lay opinions from fact witnesses, asked questions regarding witnesses' 
feelings towards Mr. Epstein and their beliefs regarding media reports of this case, 
asked whether they would leave their children with Mr. Epstein and asked whether they 
would go back to work for Mr. Epstein assuming the media reports were accurate, 
among other things. 
These questions and the responses thereto will never be 
admissible. 
They are argumentative, irrelevant and seek speculative answers and 
inadmissible lay opinions.

Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 2 of 9 
3. 
For example, in the deposition of Larry Visoski, one of Mr. Epstein's pilots, 
Plaintiff's counsel asked the following questions seeking to obtain Mr. Visoski's beliefs 
and opinions on Plaintiff's allegations: 
Q. 
All right. 
When you read in the newspapers 
the 
allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
numerous 
underage girls for sexual reasons, were you surprised? 
A. I didn't believe it. 
Q. Do you believe it today? 
A. I don't believe it. 
Q. You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was involved with 
underage girls in a sexual way? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion, and I don't 
think my opinion is relevant in that matter. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I think it's relevant. Can you just tell me whether today 
you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has engag.ed in sex with 
underage girls? 
• 
• 
• 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, irrelevant, always. 
THE WITNESS: It's irrelevant. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. I need an answer. 
A. I don't believe he had sex with underage women. 
Q. Or engaged in any· sexual acts with underage women? 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Page 3 of 9 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
You think that this ls just a story that a bunch of 
underage women have made up? 
A. 
Speculatlon. 
* * * * 
Q. 
Then we'll handle the question this way: If you were to 
believe based on information and evidence that Mr. Epstein 
engaged in sex or some form of sex acts with people of the 
age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, would you continue 
your employment with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation. 
THE 
WITNESS: 
I would 
certainly 
be 
speculating 
and I have to discuss it with my wife long and hard. I don't 
think I could give you a correct and honest answer at this 
time. 
See Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Visokski at 66-67; 181-82 (attached as 
composite Exhibit A). Other examples of similar improper questions are included in 
Exhibit A. 
4. 
Not only do these questions seek improper lay opinions, Plaintiff's counsel 
asked Mr. Visoski his belief as to the truth of hearsay newspaper articles. 
The 
foregoing questions are obviously irrelevant, argumentative and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
5. 
Moreover, whether Mr. Visoski would continue working for Mr. Epstein if 
Plaintiff's allegations are true has absolutely no relevance to any claim or defense in this 
case. 
The questions are simply improper and meant to harass and embarrass the

witness. 
6. 
Mr. Visoski was questioned for over four hou'.s and much of the time was 
wasted on irrelevant and harassing questions. 
7. 
Plaintiff's counsel asked similar questions at the deposition of Larry 
Eugene Morrison, another one of Mr. Epstein's pilots: 
Q. 
Certainly you've read certain newspaper articles about 
the allegations, police reports, otherwise, the allegations that 
occurred or have been alleged to have occurred at his Palm 
Beach mansion, correct? 
A. 
Uh-huh. 
Q. 
Correct? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Given the nature of those allegations, would you leave 
your daughter of 17, 16, 15 years old with Mr. Epstein 
alone? 
MR PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. 
* * * * 
Q. 
And despite pleading guilty to procuring underage girls 
for the purposes of sex, you still feel comfortable leaving a 
13, 14, 15-year-old girl around him? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. I mean, with my daughter, yes. I don't know how 
he behaves around anybody else. 
I just know that the 
respect that he showed me, I feel safe with my daughter. 
Q. 
And have you read in detail the reports as to what 
happened at his house with the girls?

LM V. Epstein 
Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMBAB 
Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 5 of 9 
A. 
Only --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
-- what's been in the newspapers and published. 
Q. 
If you read and hear testimony given - well, I can tell 
you now - testimony has been given in this case that what 
happens is: A 13 or 14 year old is led upstairs by herself, 
told to get naked, he lays down on his back, there is a brief 
massage before he turns over, exposes himself erect, 
masturbates while he tells this 13 or 14 year old to pinch his 
nipples as hard as she can while he inserts his fingers into 
their vagina and ejaculates all over them before saying, 
"Take your money and leave." 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Okay? Then, 
11You can continue to come back for $200 
every time or every girl you bring me within your age group 
and I get to do this again, I pay you $200 per person." If that 
is the testimony --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
Q. 
-- that what happens behind closed doors with him, do 
you still feel comfortable leaving a 13 or 14 year old in a 
room with Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
If that, in fact, is what actually happened, no. 
* * * * 
Q. 
[Would you] go back - considering what you've read and 
what you may or may not believe - would you go back to 
working for Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
I can't say. I still work for him on a maintenance - to 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 13 of 26

Page 6 of9 
maintain the airplanes and stuff like that, so. 
§ee Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Eugene Morrison at 135-36; 175-76; 184 
(attached as composite Exhibit B). 
8. 
Again, whether Mr. Morrison would work for Mr. Epstein "considering what 
[he has] read and what [he] may or may not believe" (i.e. considering hearsay media 
accounts and inadmissible lay opinion) has no bearing on the instant case. 
9. 
ln addition, questions regarding whether Mr. Morrison would leave his 
children alone with Mr. Epstein could have only been meant to harass and embarrass 
Mr. Morrison. Nevertheless, Mr. Morrison testified that he would leave his children with 
Mr. Epstein. As Plaintiffs counsel was obviously not happy with the answer to this 
question, he proceeded to press Mr. Morrison with inflammatory statements until he got 
the answer he wanted. 
10. 
Plaintiff's counsel has also asked the same improper line of questions in 
other witnesses' depositions. 
11. 
The above-cited questions exceed the bounds of permissible discovery; 
they have absolutely no relevance to this case. Accordingly, the Court should enter a 
protective order prohibiting such questions and should sanction Plaintiff's counsel if 
such inappropriate questions are asked at future depositions. 
12. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order, 1 "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, lt is not 
1 The Omnibus Order (DE #377) was entered in the federal companion case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-CIV-80119 MARRNJOH NSON in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida.

without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th 
Cir. 1992). ... 
Courts have long held that '[w]hile the standard of relevancy [in 
discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear 
germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United 
Food & Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) 
(string .cite omitted)." §ee also Capco Properties, LLC v. Monterry Gardens of Pinecrest 
Condo., 982 So. 2d 1211, (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding that discovery in civil cases must 
be relevant to the subject matter of the case and must be admissible or reasonably 
calculated to lead to admissible evidence); Morton Plant Hospital Ass'n, lnc. v. 
Shahbas, 960 So. 2d 820, 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (holding that ''discovery should be 
denied when it has been established that the information requested is neither relevant 
F 
to any pending claim or defense nor will it lead to the discovery of admissible evidence," 
citing Tanchel v. Shoemaker, 928 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006)). 
13. 
As illustrated above, the questions are simply not germane to any pending 
'--.. 
claim or defense nor will they lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Whether 
Mr. Visoski believes or disbelieves the media accounts of this case, or whether Mr. 
Morrison would leave his children with Mr. Epstein is not relevant and cannot 
conceivably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
14. 
The Court should curtail these inappropriate lines of questions and enter a 
protective order prohibiting them. 
15. 
Rule 1.280(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides the Court with 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 15 of 26
LM v. Epstein

the power to "make any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense that justice requires including 
... (4) that certain matter not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be 
limited to certain matters." 
16. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests the Court enter a protective order 
prohibiting Plaintiff's counsel from asking witnesses' questions regarding opinions and 
beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case and whether they would 
leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar nature, and limiting the scope 
to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters relevant to the claims and 
defenses in this case. See Shahbas, 960 So. 2d at 824. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests the Court 
enter a protective order prohibiting Plaintiffs counsel from asking witnesses' questions 
regarding opinions and beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case 
and whether they would leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar 
nature, and limiting the scope to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters 
relevant to the claims and defenses in this case and grant any additional relief the Court 
deems just and proper.

MR. EDWARDS: We're going to put something on 
the record about·- well, we'll do It this way -
MR. REINHART: Do it at the end, after we get 
him - whatever you want. It's your show. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. There were --1 don't 
even think Mr. Willits is aware of this. There was 
a subpoena duces tecum for this witness, as well as 
the previous witness, which was another pilot, Dave 
Rogers, and that duces teoum was to bring the 
flight logs related from 1998 through 2005. What 
was produced at the previous deposition were flight 
logs from 2002 through 2005, ancl now Mr. Reinhart 
has agreed to produce the remainder of the flight 
logs requested, those going from 1998 t11rough 2002. 
MR. REINHART; Correct. They're pilot logs, 
not night logs. There are other records we 
indicated are corporate records, and with those you 
have to deal with Mr. Critton. 
MR. CRITTON: However, with the proviso, too,

Q. All right. When you read in the newspapers 
1 
2 
the allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
2 
3 
numerous underage girls for sexual reasons, were you 
3 
4 
surprised?

A. I don't believe it.

THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion,

and I don't think my opinion·ls relevant in that

matter.

14 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
14 
15 
Q, I think it's relevant. Can you just tell rne 
15 
l 6 
whether today you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has

MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, Irrelevant,

THE WITNESS: It's irrelevant.

21 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
21 
22 
Q. I need an answer.

23 
A. I don't believe he had sex with underage 
23 
24 
women.

25 
Q. Or engaged in any sexual acts with underage

argumentative. Who gives a darn what he thinks one 
way or another? If he has personal l<nowledge -
MR. EDWARDS: You're objecting to the form? 
MR. CRITTON: It's argumentative. 
MR. EDWARDS: You're objecting to the form? 
MR. CRITTON: Yes. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q, Is that something that you believe that a 
b1.1nch of women -- some of which know each other, some 
don't, some of which have been on the airplane and some 
which haven'! - made this up, that Jeffrey Epstein 
engaged In some sexual conduct with them? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: What I believe doesn't matter in 
this case, does it? 
68 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. I need an answer. Do you believe it? Do you 
believe these girls made this up? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
MR. REINHART: I'm going to instruct him not 
to answer. Move on. 
MR. EDWARDS: Is there a privilege that we're 
asserting? 
MR. REINHART: No, It's irrelevant. It's 
harassment and not likely to lead to discoverable 
evidence. 
'MR. EDWARDS: I'm going·to--put on the record 
right now that it is -- we are allowed discovery 
into a RICO count. We are also allowed discovery 
into the intent of Mr. Epstein In developing a 
criminal enterprise designed to sexually exploit 
and sexually abuse underage girls. We believe that 
in doing so, he associated intentionally with 
people of similar beliefs that sex with underage 
girls is okay, and that there have been rnany 
discussions with this witness, as well as many 
other witnesses with -- to Ins lire his protection 
from law enforcement that they not answer these 
specific questions. And thus, the opinions and 
beliefs of all of these witnesses that we are

discove1y of admissible evidence. And If you're 
3 
Q, Okay. Isn't It true that at some point in

lime you learned that Jeffrey Epstein has - strike 
5

6 
going to continue to ask the questions and you can

MR. CRITTON: When you ultimately get lo a 
7 
instruct him not to answer and we can go to the 
7 
good place to break, Vllill you let us know? 
8 
Court. 
8 
MR. EDWARDS: Let's break now. 
9 
MR. REINHART: My response is to his opinion 
9 
(A break was had at 11:28 a.m.) 
10 
whether people making allegations in this case are 
10 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
11 
colluding or making up a story is irrelevant to 
11 
Q. All right. Eighteen years of being a pilot 
12 
what you just said. So I am going to instruct him 
12 
for Jeffrey Epstein and in terms of being able to name 
13 
not to answer any question that goes to his opinion 
13 
somebody that you would say you've observed with Jeffrey 
14 
of someone else's motivation or the truth of facts 
14 
Epstein and would classify that person as Jeffrey 
15 
to which he has no knowledge, 
15 
Epstein's friend, can you name anybody? 
16 
So yes, I'm instructing him not to answer,

A. Nadia, Sarah; Just people that we see

MR. CRIHON: Let me add in rny part, Is that I 
17 
routinely on the airplane.

think•· you're certainly not only capable to ask 
18 
Q, ll1at's people you see routinely In the last 
19 
questions with regard to what his personal 
19 
five to ten years, right? 
20 
knowledge is, and if he knows something or he has 
20 
A. Yes. 
21 
reasonable basis for it; certainly you are entitled 
21 
Q, Prior to that time, anybody that you've 
22 
to that information. I think you've asked those 
22 
noticed as Jeffrey Epstein's friend may be Ghislaine 
23 
questions and he's given you straightforward 
23 
Maxwell? 
24 
answers as to what he knew or what he didn't know 
24 
A. What time frame? 
25 
under those circumstances, And as to what his 
25 
Q, 
Is that a person that at some point In time 
70

1 
thoughts are on something which he has no factual

you would classify as Jeffrey Epstein's friend? 
2 
basis or even an assumption to know one way or

A. I would classify it. I don't know If it's

true.

fact-finder in !his case. 
4 
Q. But that's only because they were on the 
5 
While it's interesting, it's argumentative and 
5 
airplane together?

I don't think he's -- I mean, do ii on a 
6 
A. Yes. 
7 
question-by-question basis. if he has knowledge, 
7 
Q, Do you know what Jeffrey Epstein does for a 
8 
that's great, but to argue your case with this 
8 
living In your 18 years of observing and talking with 
9 
witness or any other witness doesn't serve a

10 
purpose and I think is, you !~now -- I think it's

A. No. 
11 
not a good use of our time, I'll put ii !hat way. 
11 
Q, No Idea?

18 years of knowledge, experience and observation of 
23 
Florida and around the world, you have no Idea what he

you were to believe based on information and evidence 
2 o 
that Mr. Epstein engaged in sex or some form of sex act 
21 
with people of the age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years

hard. I don't think I could give you a correct and 
3 
honest answer at this time.

Q. Okay. Given the allegations that have been 
6 
made in this case, is this something that you have 
7 
discussed with anyone other than your attorney? 
B 
A. No, not really. Only from the fact that 
9 
they're allegations and there's still a lot more work,

I'm sure, to be discovered.

If nobody requests the deposilion, I'd just
