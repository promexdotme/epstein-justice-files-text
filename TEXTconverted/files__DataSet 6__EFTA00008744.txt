A. 
Yes. 
MS. 
Ladies and gentlemen, some of the 
testimony you are going to hear from Detective 
will 
include hearsay. That means he is not going to testify only 
from his own personal observations, he will also be 
testifying about what other people have told him and what he 
has read in documents. 
Hearsay evidence, as you know, is admissible and 
proper in these proceedings, and you are permitted to rely 
on it in determining whether there is probable cause to 
indict the defendant, but if you want to hear testimony from 
other witnesses, or see particular documents, please let me 
know, and I will make my best efforts to bring those before 
you.

that behavior as grooming." 
Q. 
"When you say grooming, did she explain what she 
meant by that?" 
A. 
"She meant that they were building a relationship 
with her, giving her things, taking her places, and then 
usually when the grooming happens, an offender will -- once 
they gain that trust -- they will make their relationship 
turn sexual."

grooming her, is that right?"

now?"

realize that at the time."

the term grooming based on your experience investigating 
crimes involving sexual exploitation of minors?"

"Grooming is when someone builds a relationship 
with a child. They will find a vulnerability or a need and 
then they work on gaining that child's trust. And then 
often times gaining a parent's trust. Once they have that 
trust, they show that in ways that they can care about them; 
like giving them gifts and promises. And then once that's 
established, they then turn the relationship sexual; often 
times, making sexual comments and normalizing the behavior."

describing, that 
told you about, did 
say whether 
Epstein ever gave her anything?"

give the cash to her mom because he knew that they needed 
it. He paid for her voice lessons as well."

has 
characterized these visits now, but based on your 
conversations with her, at the time did she feel that these 
visits were strange at all?"

normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister 
and made comments like, this is what grownups do."

Q. 
"So just a small legal instruction on this topic. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I instruct you that the allegations in 
the lawsuit are not being presented to you as evidence that 
those incidents occurred. I instruct you that you should 
not consider those allegations for their truth. Instead, 
the circumstances of the lawsuit are being presented to you 
so that you can consider the context of the case and the 
circumstances under which Maxwell made statements under 
oath. Turning back to the deposition, did Maxwell's 
deposition take place over two different days?" 
A. 
"Yes."
