and spell your name for the record.

Special Agent II 
18 
19 
Q 
And with whom do you work? 
20 
A 
The FBI here in West Palm Beach. 
21 
Q 
And are you here today on the continuing 
22 
investigation known as Operation Leap Year? 
23 
A 
Yes, I am. 
24 
Q 
And you are one of the case agents on this 
25 
investigation, correct? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009513

3 
1 
A 
Yes, I am. 
2 
Q 
The last time you were here we were discussing 
3 
the evidence supporting various overt acts and charges 
4 
related to Jane Does number 1 and 2? 
5 
A 
Yes. 
6 
Q 
Today we are going to start with Jane Doe 
7 
number 3. Can you tell the Grand Jury who that is and 
8 
summarize briefly your previous testimony about her. 
9 
A 
Jane Doe number 3 is 
I and she first 
10 
started, we have first phone contact with 
11 
starting in December of 2004, IIIIIII would have been 16 
12 
or 17 at that time, let me do the math real quick, she 
13 
would have been 16 -- sorry, I am sorry, she would have 
14 
been at that time 17, let's get it right, so she started 
15 
phone contact, 
started calling her in 
16 
September of 2004. 
17 
From testimony we know that 
went there 
18 
earlier, much earlier. 
I, which was Jane Doe 
19 
number 4 you will hear about next, they were good 
20 
friends and they both went in the spring of '04, prior 
21 
to 
17th birthday, so 
did start giving 
22 
mr. Epstein massages when she was 16, she performed a 
23 
few massages for Mr. Epstein and then took kind of a 
24 
little bit of a break. 
25 
The sexual activity that occurred with 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE

4 
1 
Mr. Epstein when 
was under the age of 18 
2 
included 
3 
she was given gifts by Mr. Epstein, she was 
5 
given a 
, she was given Victoria Secret 
6 
underwear, she was also given a car that Mr. Epstein 
7 
rented for her for a number of months, she was paid $200 
8 
by Mr. Epstein and 
was the one that primarily 
9 
called 
to set up appointments and as you can see 
10 
that began in December of '04. 
11 
was also one of Mr. Epstein's 
12 
favorites, according to several of the other girls. 
13 
Q 
Just so the Grand Jury has an idea, how does 
14 
that translate into the number of phone calls between 
15 
and 
that you were able to calculate? 
16 
A 
called her, I guess calls between 
17 
the two of them ranged around 125 phone calls from 
18 
December 6th, 2004 until October, 2005. 
19 
Q 
And just briefly can you remind the Grand Jury 
20 
did 
ever tell Mr. Epstein her age? 
21 
A 
No, they did not ever discuss, she did not 
22 
tell him how old she was, but she did tell him where she 
23 
planned on going to school and that she was in 
24 
she stated that when it came to her age that 
25 
Mr. Epstein didn't care. As I mentioned earlier, 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009515

S 
1 
and IIIIIII were very good friends and IIIII would talk 
2 
about IIIIIII and Mr. Epstein would ask questions about 
3 
when IIIII was providing massages and as we will 
4 
talk about when we talk about Jane Doe number 4, which 
5 
is 
, she told Mr. Epstein that she was a junior in 
6 
high school and that 
and her were in the 
7 
and that they were 
8 
and 
told us that at one point IIIII had come to 
9 
her because she had slipped about prom and she was 
10 
worried because Epstein was supposed to think she was 18 
11 
and she had talked about the prom and 
said she 
12 
never heard anything else about it and they never 
13 
brought it up. 
14 
Q 
Because, according to 
, Mr. Epstein 
15 
didn't care really how old the girls were? 
16 
A 
Exactly. 
17 
Q 
And she never mentioned he asked her for her 
18 
age or asked for any form of identification to show 
19 
whether she was or was not over 18? 
20 
A 
No. 
21 
Q 
Now, if you could turn to the proposed 
22 
indictment and if I could ask you to look at overt act 
23 
number 59. 
24 
A 
we had a little knock at the door 
Do you 
25 
want me to get it?

And just so the record is clear, those are the 
8 
photographs that we showed to the Grand Jury last week? 
9 
A 
Yes, it is. 
10 
Q 
So if you could turn to overt act number 59 
11 
which appears on page 12, and if you could explain to 
12 
the Grand Jury the evidence we have related to that 
13 
phone call or phone calls on December 6th, 2004.

16

3 
Q 
And just so that it is clear to the Grand 
4 
Jury, when the overt acts says that defendant IIIIII

made one or more telephone calls, that means that the 
6 
call is originating from IIIII 
phone, is that

12 
Q

21 
indicates and shows that 
was clearly 16 years of 
22 
age when she started going to Mr. Epstein's and 
23 
performing massages for Mr. Epstein. 
24 
I, our Jane Doe number 1, was the one 
25

that she

could make $200, she needed to dress cute, he might try 
2 
to touch you, but if you feel uncomfortable just let him 
3 
know and he will stop, and the first massage that 
4 
did he repeatedly told 
, and I mentioned this to 
5 
you in the last Grand Jury session, she was very shy and 
6 
he would repeatedly tell her not to be so shy, that she 
7 
didn't have to be so shy. 
8 
Epstein asked her to remove her clothing and 
9 
she told him no, and throughout the massage he would 
10 
repeatedly grab at her, 
he did 
11 
through this first massage and pulled her 
12 
clothes, she would pull away and she was paid $200 for 
13 
that. 
14 
Upon leaving the first massage Mr. Epstein 
15 
told 
that if 
was willing to do more she 
16 
would get paid more. He also informed 
that if she 
17 
would bring her pretty friends he would also pay her for 
18 
bringing her pretty friends. He told 
that 
19 
would get her phone number. 
20 
says that she performed three to four 
21 
massages for Mr. Epstein. we have with 
22 
approximately a hundred phone calls between 
23 
and 
24

she became very upset 
25 
when we got to the sexual massages that she did for 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE

19 
1 
Mr. Epstein. At this point, this is as much as we know 
2 
at this point of what occurred with Mr. Epstein and 
3 
4 
she did three to four massages and those last 
5 
massages they became more sexual in nature, he asked her 
6 
again to remove her clothing, this time she took her 
7 
shirt off, he asked her to take her bra off, she said 
8 
no. 
9 
He again would 
, he did continue 
this time 
11 
she 
He continued to compliment 
12 
her, tell her she had a nice body and that she was 
13 
pretty. 
14 
says that he was very nice and engaged 
15 
her in conversation, asked her, you know, if she had a 
16 
boyfriend. In the last massage she discusses with me, 
17 
and this massage Mr. Epstein told her to stop being shy 
18 
and asked her to take her clothes off and 
said 
19 
that she had a boyfriend and she didn't feel comfortable 
20 
taking her clothes off and he told her you should know 
21 
what to expect by now when you come here, and he jerked 
22 
on her pants as to like jerk them down, so she did on 
23 
this last massage get down to her bra and underwear. 
24 
She describes his tone at this time being 
25 
frustrated and irritated, she stayed in her bra and

underwear, but during the massage he grabbed her bra and 
2 
pulled it down and 
, he had 
3 
instructed her to 
while she 
4 
was massaging his chest, he tried to grab her all over, 
5 
he knew that she was upset with this massage. 
6 
At one point Mr. Epstein asked her if she had 
7 
sex with her boyfriend, 
informs him that she is 
8 
still a virgin and he responds what, you don't like sex? 
9 
And that's pretty much the way that last massage went. 
10 
Q 
Now, Special Agent 
, just to 
11 
interrupt you, you mentioned that lane Doe number 4 
12 
became very upset as you were asking her about the 
13 
massages, correct? 
14 
A 
Yes. 
15 
Q 
And when she was describing this incident with 
16 
him grabbing at her breast and trying to pull her pants 
17 
down and instructing her to remove her pants, correct? 
18 
A 
Yes. 
19 
Q 
You had talked last week about the expert that 
20 
you had spoken with about interviewing victims of these 
21 
types of offenses? 
22 
A 
Right. 
23 
Q 
And you had told us about how a victim may be 
24 
reticent at first to tell the entire story until a 
25 
rapport is built? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009531

21 
1 
A 
Right. 
2 
Q 
Can you tell the Grand Jury your impressions 
3 
of your interview with 
4 
A 
She became so visibly upset, and a lot of the 
5 
girls are embarrassed of what took place, but when she 
6 
talked about the last massage and him grabbing her 
7 
breasts and fondling her breasts she was in tears and we 
8 
stopped the massage and we calmed her down, trying to go 
9 
back there was just too difficult, I could not get her 
10 
back to discussing anything further that had taken 
11 
place. 
12 
I have since then -- I have since talked to 
13 
again and I feel there is more there, but I just 
14 
don't think she is ready to disclose what took place. 
15 
Q 
So based upon the more than 60 telephone calls 
16 
as well as --
17 
A 
Approximately a hundred. 
18 
Q 
-- 100 telephone calls and your conversations 
19 
with 
you think there is probably more than four 
20 
massages that happened? 
21 
A 
Yes, I do. 
22 
Q 
was there anything else that you wanted to 
23 
discuss with the Grand Jury? 
24 
A 
Just, as I stated in the beginning of those 
25 
massages, they engaged in conversation and throughout 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
Copy I of 13 
EFTA00009532

22 
1 
that conversation, you know, she did inform mr. Epstein 
2 
that she was a junior in high school and again she is 
3 
one of the girls that talks about 
being Mr. 
4 
Epstein's favorite, so because Mr. Epstein knew they 
5 
were friends they would engage in conversation about 
6 
, and 
would mention they were in the 
7 
and they would discuss the friendship 
8 
they had between the two girls with Mr. Epstein and 
9 
think that's it. 
10 
Q 
All right. If we could turn to the 
11 
post-indictment to overt act number 4 which appears on 
12

Yes. 
16 
Q 
And did you compare those with the phone 
17
