Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, “Defendants”; and Defendants together with Plaintiffs Jane Doe 15, 
Mary Doe, and Teala Davies, the “Parties”) in the referenced actions.  Pursuant to the Court’s 
direction at the initial conference, we write on behalf of all Parties to report to the Court 
regarding status on these actions.  
First, with respect to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”), Plaintiffs’ 
counsel in these actions have reviewed the Program’s protocol and begun to propose 
substantive changes to it and to confer with the Program’s designers and administrator, and are 
considering whether their clients will participate. 
Second, with respect to the litigation of these three actions, the Parties conducted their Rule 
26(f) conference by telephone yesterday, and are proceeding to finalize stipulations with respect 
to anonymity (to the extent that is relevant, for two of the three actions) and a Protective Order; 
the Parties further agree to exchange initial disclosures by January 23, 2020, proposed 
discovery schedules by January 30th, and then to propose a jointly agreed upon (or, absent an 
agreement, our alternate proposals) to Your Honor by February 6, 2020.  
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz
