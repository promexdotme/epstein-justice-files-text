THE COURT:  Okay.  All right, so good morning. 
3 
Of the many cases that have been referred to me 
4 
for supervision, two have been stayed at the request of the 
5 
parties.  All of you who are here today on these cases, 
6 
they're not stayed.  We need to put discovery schedules in 
7 
place.  I would like to get the latest, though, with 
8 
respect to potential for settlement.  I've been hearing 
9 
various and assorted rumors about the difficulties of 
10 
trying to progress with settlement.  Can you give me a -- 
11 
I'll turn to on defendants' side first -- tell me what the 
12 
latest is? 
13 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  And do I recall correctly 
14 
you prefer that we stand? 
15 
THE COURT:  Sure.  Just if you're talking for 
16 
some long period of time and you need to be looking at

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I prefer it. 
19 
THE COURT:  -- I'll let you sit. 
20 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you.  And I appreciate the 
21 
opportunity to explain what's going on in terms of 
22 
potential resolutions of these actions and specifically 
23 
with respect to the Epstein victims compensation program, 
24 
which as the Court knows, is a completely voluntary 
25

6 
program. 
2 
Well, a lot has certainly happened since the last 
3 
time we were before your Honor back on November 21, 2019.  
4 
What I'm pleased to report, before I get to some of the 
5 
more difficult issues, is that the vast majority of 
6 
plaintiffs here today, and, in fact, the vast majority of 
7 
alleged victims of Mr. Epstein have, through their counsel, 
8 
voiced unequivocal support for and intend to participate in 
9 
the voluntary program, which is great.  And as your Honor 
10 
just mentioned, though it's not even required and it was 
11 
not something I asked, five plaintiffs, soon to be six, 
12 
because of a proposed amendment, in one case plaintiffs 
13 
have already voluntarily stayed their litigation in favor 
14 
of their participation in the program.  Again, that's not 
15 
something that's required but they saw the wisdom of doing 
16 
that and conserving resources, which is something we 
17 
welcome. 
18 
The plaintiffs' support for the program followed 
19 
the numerous discussions we had since we appeared before 
20 
your Honor and you suggested everyone should be speaking 
21 
and speaking often.  There were many discussions among 
22 
myself and many attorneys in this room, as well as separate 
23 
meetings between the claims program designers and 
24 
administrators.  Again, that's Ken Feinberg is the 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 6 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
7 
designer; Jordana Feldman is the designer and the sole 
2 
administrator; and Camille Biros, who's also a designer.  
3 
They met with, I understand, several times the various 
4 
plaintiffs' counsel here today and other ones not here 
5 
today.  And through all of these, you know, efforts over 
6 
the past several months, we have a great showing of 
7 
participation or intended participation in a program which 
8 
has great promise of resolving many of these claims.  In 
9 
fact, the protocol, which if your Honor may recall, that's 
10 
the nuts and bolts of the program.  Plaintiffs' counsel has 
11 
weighed in on that protocol.  The current draft reflects 
12 
some of their input.  And that's all great. 
13 
But here's the tricky part, if you will.  There is 
14 
one reason, and only one reason, that the claims program 
15 
hasn't commenced, and that is because the attorney general 
16 
for the Virgin Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, who we 
17 
firmly understand represents no victims -- zero -- has, for 
18 
whatever reason that we don't understand, impeded the 
19 
formal establishment of the program, against our wishes, 
20 
and more strikingly, against the wishes of the plaintiffs' 
21 
counsel in this room and other plaintiffs' counsel not here 
22 
today.   
23 
And if I can just -- and I'll try to do this 
24 
succinctly as a matter of context of how we got to this 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 7 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
8 
place where the attorney general has done this -- on 
2 
November 14, 2019, the co-executors filed a motion in the 
3 
probate court for the formal approval of the establishment 
4 
of the claims program.  Of course, everything runs through 
5 
the probate court.  The probate court has ultimate control 
6 
and authority over all assets of the estate, and hence, we 
7 
needed to seek formal approval.  We then had the conference 
8 
with your Honor about a week later.  All of the good things 
9 
that followed from that which I just went over, all the 
10 
efforts that yielded the almost uniform support for the 
11 
program among plaintiffs and alleged victims that I just 
12 
described.   
13 
Very regrettably, however, in the meantime and 
14 
much more recently, long after everyone in this room was 
15 
working very diligently to come together on the program, 
16 
the attorney general for the Virgin Islands has again, for 
17 
whatever reason, decided to impede the program.  So on 
18 
January 15, which is by the way more than five months after 
19 
Mr. Epstein died, the AG in the Virgin Islands publicly 
20 
announced that earlier that day she filed a complaint 
21 
against Mr. Epstein's estate and certain related entities 
22 
under what is known as the Virgin Islands Criminally 
23 
Influence and Corrupt Organization Act, which I understand 
24 
is referred to as a CICO action.  So in the CICO action, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 8 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
9 
very briefly, although it's very difficult to follow and 
2 
far from clear, the USVI government appears to seek 
3 
forfeiture of all assets in Mr. Epstein's estate even 
4 
though he was never charged with, let alone convicted of, 
5 
the underlying CICO allegations and notwithstanding that, 
6 
with few exceptions, a lot of what's alleged has no nexus 
7 
to the Virgin Islands.  Yet, the government comes in five 
8 
months later and says, "We get everything."  And, again, 
9 
they represent no victims. 
10 
So we understand, from counsel admitted in the 
11 
Virgin Islands, that this is without precedent in the 
12 
Virgin Islands or elsewhere, for that matter, as far as we 
13 
can determine.   
14 
Shortly after filing the complaint, the attorney 
15 
general for the Virgin Islands purported to issue liens 
16 
against each of the defendants named in the CICO action, 
17 
okay, including the estate, and even including -- and 
18 
everything, by the way, everything within the estate, 
19 
including the estate's operating account that it needs to 
20 
function to pay lawyers, to pay house managers, people that 
21 
mow the grass, to simply function.  The attorney general 
22 
came in and said, "We have a priority lien over everyone 
23 
and anything that exists, and everything is within the 
24 
scope of these liens." 
25

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
10 
On January 23, to make matters worse, the attorney 
2 
general sought to intervene in the probate proceedings to, 
3 
among other things, oppose -- I mean, this is really 
4 
amazing stuff -- oppose the establishment of the claims 
5 
program that the victims are for, the alleged victims that 
6 
have already spoken about, almost uniformly, for the 
7 
establishment.  Unfortunately, most of what the attorney 
8 
general said in the attorney general's various filings, 
9 
including the motion to intervene, about the claims program 
10 
was just simply wrong.  For example, the attorney general 
11 
made a bunch of criticisms that would have only made sense 
12 
if it was an involuntary program.  But it's voluntary, it's 
13 
completely voluntary; no one is forced to do anything.   
14 
On February 4, last week, I observed a hearing at 
15 
which USVI counsel for the estate appeared and actually 
16 
several attorneys in this room -- I'm sure they will speak 
17 
for themselves -- were also in attendance at this hearing 
18 
in the probate court.  And the hearing was on all pending 
19 
motions to date, some of which, including the one for the 
20 
establishment of the claims program, had been pending for 
21 
quite some time, to say the least.  So this was, obviously, 
22 
an important hearing.  The attorney general's motion to 
23 
intervene, the assumption of the claims program, everything 
24 
was heard last Tuesday.  Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Feldman 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 10 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
11 
testified at the hearing to address the attorney general's 
2 
various concerns, again, from my view, not speaking for Mr. 
3 
Feinberg and Ms.  Feldman but just based on complete 
4 
misunderstanding of what the program is and does.  The 
5 
probate judge acknowledged very clearly -- I don't have the 
6 
transcript yet -- and as soon as I get it, I respectfully 
7 
request the opportunity to submit a copy to your Honor; I 
8 
think it's very important for your Honor to see it directly 
9 
as it bears directly on all these cases here and the 
10 
prospect for settlement.  Getting back to the probate 
11 
judge, she acknowledged that the estate wants the program 
12 
to go forward, the alleged victims want the program to go 
13 
forward, and that it would be much quicker, more cost 
14 
effective than drawn-out litigation. 
15 
The testimony of Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Feldman was 
16 
also, from my viewpoint, well received and addressed just 
17 
everything that the attorney general purported to be 
18 
concerned with.  However, because of what the attorney 
19 
general did with these liens, the probate judge asked the 
20 
parties and voiced concern that the probate court's hands 
21 
are effectively tied.   And thus, what the probate judge 
22 
has done is asked the estate, asked the attorney general, 
23 
anyone else who's interested, to brief that court on the 
24 
effect of the liens. 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
12 
So as I appear here today, I don't know when the 
2 
program will be established.  But time is, of course, of 
3 
the essence.  If the AG does not very quickly remove all 
4 
perceived impediments to the establishment of the program, 
5 
we may miss the window for fulsome participation in the 
6 
program.  This is something your Honor heard last time, 
7 
that people wanted -- if there's going to be a program, 
8 
they want it to move quickly.  Well, we were all here ready 
9 
to go, and the AG had a different idea, I suppose. 
10 
I do want to be clear, since I mentioned these 
11 
liens, by the way, the estate's position is they're 
12 
invalid.  We briefed some of this with the Court already, 
13 
addressed it in court, in the probate court.  And that's 
14 
something we will deal with, but in the meantime, like I 
15 
said, time is of the essence with the program. 
16 
I do want to address an entirely related but 
17 
separate issue that the AG's actions have caused.  And this 
18 
is also something we just don't understand.  You know, as I 
19 
said, the AG has purported to put liens on everything in 
20 
the estate, including the operating account.  Even if it's 
21 
not the AG's intention, if she maintains those liens and 
22 
says effectively, "Estate, you can't pay anyone.  You can't 
23 
pay your attorneys," well, then, the co-executors have no 
24 
way to litigate all of these cases that are here and in 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 12 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
13 
other courts.  That came up at the February 4 hearing, and 
2 
the Court denied, by the way, the AG's motion to intervene.  
3 
It was procedurally improper.  And the Court specifically 
4 
addressed the liens, acknowledging that they have potential 
5 
disastrous effect if the AG contends that those liens 
6 
should freeze all assets including those necessary for the 
7 
estate to simply function, pay taxes, attorneys, whatever.  
8 
Counsel for the AG on the record informed the Court that 
9 
the AG did not intend for the liens to prohibit the co-
10 
executors from paying the estate's administration expenses 
11 
or to preserve its assets.   
12 
Regrettably, right after that hearing, counsel for 
13 
the co-executors received formal notification from the bank 
14 
where the estate's operating account is, informing the co-
15 
executors that, because of the lien, the bank has placed a 
16 
hold on the estate's accounts.  And the AG, as we sit here 
17 
a week later, after this representation in court by one of 
18 
her attorneys, has not lifted the lien.  So very soon the 
19 
estate's not going to be able to make payroll for people 
20 
that help take care of the decedent's properties, attorneys 
21 
will go unpaid, and everything is going to come to a 
22 
screeching halt.  We hope that doesn't happen.  I can 
23 
assure the Court I'm not for the inability of the estate to 
24 
pay its counsel, but here we are.  And there are various 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 13 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
14 
constitutional issues, of course:  How can someone be 
2 
forced to defend actions when they can't pay their counsel?  
3 
But, again, we hope the AG will remove these impediments 
4 
and these actions won't need to be stayed; and, more 
5 
importantly, the program will go forward.  USVI counsel for 
6 
the estate is very diligently working to resolve these 
7 
issues with the attorney general, but it's been very 
8 
difficult.  And as I sit here today, this is the 
9 
unfortunate mixed news that I have to report to your Honor 
10 
about the claims program. 
11 
And thank you, by the way, for giving me the time 
12 
to address it. 
13 
THE COURT:  Anyone on plaintiffs' side want to 
14 
address anything that's just been said? 
15 
MS. KAPLAN:  Yes, your Honor, briefly.  Roberta 
16 
Kaplan.  Your Honor, there's no small degree of irony in 
17 
what you just heard from my friend on the other side, given 
18 
the fact that two days before he died, Mr. Epstein signed a 
19 
will that specifically designated the Virgin Islands for 
20 
the probate of his estate.  This is a problem of his will 
21 
and his own making.  And the idea that they thought it was 
22 
going to go well for them in the Virgin Islands and now it 
23 
hasn't is somehow unexpected.  It was obviously quite 
24 
deliberate that the Virgin Islands was chosen as the 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 14 of 67

15 
jurisdiction. 
2 
In terms of the settlement process and the 
3 
procedures set up with Mr. Feinberg and others, we of 
4 
course, as you've heard, want it to work out.  But one of 
5 
the reasons for the attorney general's objections are the 
6 
same reasons that we said to your Honor at the first 
7 
hearing we had that it was done unilaterally, that there 
8 
was no consultation.  The Court seems to be extremely 
9 
concerned about the amount in fees being paid out of the 
10

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, the court, the probate 
13 
court? 
14 
MS. KAPLAN:  The court in the Virgin Islands -- 
15 
THE COURT:  The probate court? 
16 
MS. KAPLAN:  -- seems to be concerned about the 
17 
amount that's being paid without any supervision.  On 
18 
Friday there was an article in The New York Times, which 
19 
I'm sure your Honor saw, about millions of dollars being 
20 
run through a previously defunct bank that Mr. Epstein has 
21 
set up.  There's no clarity, no diligence, no knowledge of 
22 
anyone about any of this.  And while we certainly want the 
23 
fund to go forward, we certainly want people to have that 
24 
option, the concerns on the part of both the judge in the

PROCEEDINGS 
16 
Virgin Islands and the attorney general in the Virgin 
2 
Islands are not unfounded. 
3 
With respect to meetings with Mr. Feinberg, yes, 
4 
we had those meetings.  Changes were recommended to the 
5 
protocol based on those meetings.  I hadn't seen yet 
6 
whether they were adopted.  I'm glad to hear from my friend 
7 
on the other side that they were, but we have not received 
8 
a copy of that.  One thing Mr. Feinberg did say at those 
9 
meetings -- and I think it's very crucial -- we put this in 
10 
our letter to your Honor -- it was absolutely his explicit 
11 
requirement that in order for him to do what he was going 
12 
to do, no plaintiff could be required or asked to stay the 
13 
litigation in this court in order to proceed with the 
14 
proceedings.  So that is an absolute explicit precondition 
15 
of what he's doing, and there is no stay required or asked 
16 
of any plaintiff proceeding in these cases.  And for those 
17 
reasons -- and I'm sure we're going to talk about it today, 
18 
given what you've heard -- 
19 
THE COURT:  No stay required or asked for by 
20 
defendants, is that what you're saying? 
21 
MS. KAPLAN:  So that in order -- if a plaintiff 
22 
wants to participate in the settlement process, the 
23 
defendant can't ask them to stay their cases.  And staying 
24 
the cases is not a precondition or a requirement --

PROCEEDINGS 
17 
THE COURT:  All right, plaintiffs can ask; and if 
2 
plaintiffs ask, defendants can agree. 
3 
MS. KAPLAN:  Of course, plaintiffs can always ask.  
4 
If it's by mutual agreement of the parties, that can always 
5 
happen. 
6 
But I think that only highlights the importance of 
7 
getting these cases moving, getting discovery moving, 
8 
particularly with what you've heard from the other side, 
9 
that there's no prediction at this point of when any 
10 
settlement process can even begin.  And none of us, we're 
11 
sitting here before on this side table, we have no idea how 
12 
long these things will take in the Virgin Islands.  At 
13 
least speaking for my client, we would prefer to have a 
14 
judgment, given the uncertainty in this court, and we'd 
15 
like to get moving. 
16 
THE COURT:  Anyone else? 
17 
MR. EDWARDS:  Brad Edwards, your Honor.  I'd only 
18 
like to address a few points.  I was in the Virgin Islands 
19 
last week.  And after the hearing, we went and personally 
20 
met with the attorney general and explained what it was 
21 
about the current setup of the protocol and the program 
22 
that many of the victims liked.  And the attorney general 
23 
specifically addressed some of the things about the program 
24 
she did not like, most notably the fact that all three of 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 17 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
18 
the administrators were chosen by the estate unilaterally.  
2 
And the attorney general did not say the lien is for the 
3 
purposes of taking everything into the Virgin Islands and 
4 
to disenfranchise the victims.  What she has said and as of 
5 
yesterday disseminated a letter to many of us -- I know to 
6 
the estate counsel as well as to myself -- I think it's 
7 
most appropriate probably to file it with your Honor so 
8 
that you understand exactly where things stand with the 
9 
attorney general's position as to the claims protocol.  She 
10 
put in writing 13 what she called commitments that she 
11 
wants from the estate in order to allow the claims program 
12 
to -- a claims program to go forward.  Some of them are 
13 
fairly minor; it looks like it could be worked out.  Some 
14 
of them may be more difficult to work out.   
15 
But the probate judge recognized that there was 
16 
going to be this discrepancy; and until something is done 
17 
with the attorney general's lien, the probate court simply 
18 
can't allow any program to go forward.  So that court asked 
19 
both the estate lawyers and the AG to continue working 
20 
together with one another to reach a compromise and allow a 
21 
program to go forward.  Like I said, we have very specific 
22 
commitments that the AG wants in writing from the estate; 
23 
and so long as those commitments are met, some of which are 
24 
fairly minor, she is willing to allow -- to withdraw some 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 18 of 67

19 
major portion of her lien to allow the program to begin. 
2 
So I don't think it's as far apart as was 
3 
represented earlier, but I do think it would help your 
4 
Honor to have, you know, possession of the AG's recent 
5 
letter that she circulated yesterday. 
6 
MS. McCAWLEY:  This is Sigrid McCawley on behalf 
7 
of Bois Schiller.  I just wanted to address the importance 
8 
of because of the dynamic with what's happening with the 
9 
estate and the AG, much of which is not within our 
10 
control -- 
11 
THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  Just move the mic 
12 
a little closer for the sake of the recording of the 
13 
conference. 
14 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course.  -- so much of which is 
15 
not within our control, what's going to happen with the 
16 
estate and the AG.  There's clearly a division there.  That 
17 
just emphasizes the importance of this Court's power to 
18 
move these cases forward.  It's really important to these 
19 
victims to seek justice in this circumstance.  They want to 
20 
move their cases forward.  Of course they're interested in 
21 
the claims program, if that comes to fruition.  But at this 
22 
point there's a lot that needs to go on before that can 
23 
happen.  We're here to try to move our cases forward.  
24 
We've put forth, we think, reasonable schedules to your

Honor that we'd like to move forward with as swiftly as 
2 
possible. 
3 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I don't have much 
4 
control over what happens in the Virgin Islands, as in 
5 
none.   
6 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Can I briefly respond, your Honor? 
7 
THE COURT:  Go ahead. 
8 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  You know, it's interesting.  I was 
9 
in the Virgin Islands last week, Mr. Edwards was there, 
10 
Mr. Schiller was there.  You heard a completely different 
11 
tone with respect to the same, assuming Ms. Kaplan, that 
12 
she's not included in this -- clearly, she had some issues 
13 
with the program, that's fine.  That's her view of what's 
14 
best for her client.  That's not for us to argue with. 
15 
The same attorneys I just mentioned, excluding 
16 
Ms. Kaplan, their Virgin Islands counsel stood up and 
17 
unequivocally voiced that they want this program to go 
18 
forward.  That's what they want.  We want it to go forward.  
19 
I can assure you, speaking directly on behalf of the 
20 
estate, that we have tried to discuss this with the 
21 
attorney general.  At every attempt things become more 
22 
difficult in terms of being able to see eye to eye.   
23 
And I'd like to point out, in addition to the 
24 
problem of attorneys not being paid and the estate coming 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 20 of 67

21 
to a screeching halt, everyone in this room I trust 
2 
recognizes that, according to the attorney general, her 
3 
liens are number one.  You can get a judgment -- if you 
4 
think you're going to get a judgment one day, you can try, 
5 
and maybe you will, maybe you won't.  According to the 
6 
attorney general, she goes first.  She represents no 
7 
victims, but she goes first.  So it's not just some 
8 
amorphous problem that's out there that's for me to deal 
9 
with because Mr. Epstein's will is being probated there at 
10 
his decision.  No, the attorney general's actions are 
11 
problems for everyone in this room. 
12 
THE COURT:  All right, again, I can't do anything 
13 
about the attorney general in the Virgin Islands.  I can 
14 
ask counsel to keep reporting back to me as to what's 
15 
happening.  I'd appreciate that.  If you think the Court 
16 
would benefit from seeing a transcript, seeing a letter, by 
17 
all means file whatever you think is useful. 
18 
I'm not going to worry right now about defendants 
19 
not being able to represent themselves in these cases.  If 
20 
that happens, it happens.  You have potentially some 
21 
individuals who could represent themselves pro se if they 
22 
wanted to.  It might be rather difficult.  Any corporate 
23 
entities, of course, would be in default if defendants stop 
24 
litigating the matter and don't have counsel paid for and 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 21 of 67

22 
able to appear.  But we'll jump off that bridge when we get 
2 
to it.  It seems to me that you're not there.  Hopefully 
3 
you won't get there.  If you do, we'll have a whole, you 
4 
know, slew of motion practice on defaults.  Let's assume 
5 
that's not going to happen, at least for the moment. 
6 
I do think I need to set discovery schedules. I'd 
7 
like to get a feel for what the discovery would entail:  
8 
what we're talking about in terms of volume of documents; 
9 
what we're talking about in terms of number of witnesses on 
10 
each side; what we're talking about in terms of experts, 
11 
just to get a feel because understanding scope of potential 
12 
discovery helps the Court understand what a reasonable 
13 
schedule would be, as opposed to just saying this many 
14 
months, that many months, understanding. 
15 
In addition, you all have proposed deadlines for 
16 
motions to amend.  I want to understand how likely it is 
17 
that there'll be amendments, what you would need to know in 
18 
order for there to be an amendment, because the amendment 
19 
deadlines, which I realize are largely guided by the 
20 
individual rules of a lot of the district judges here who 
21 
have very tight proposed deadlines, the amendment deadlines 
22 
that are being proposed would come up fairly quickly, and I 
23 
don't know that plaintiffs would have any more information 
24 
available to them than they have now.  Is there information 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 22 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
23 
plaintiffs would need in discovery in order to determine 
2 
whether they really need to amend, and what kind of 
3 
information is that?  I'd just like to get an overall feel 
4 
so I can do something sensible.  And as I said in my order, 
5 
the schedules for these cases need not be identical.  But 
6 
I'd like to understand what differences there are if we're 
7 
going to have different schedules. 
8 
Okay, so let me first get a feel for, on the 
9 
amendment question, since that would be an early deadline.  
10 
There's already one case where there's a proposed 
11 
amendment.  There are some differently named defendants in 
12 
these cases.  What are plaintiffs thinking in terms of 
13 
whether there's a likelihood of amendment and what they 
14 
would need to know, what they would need to learn in 
15 
discovery, if anything, in order to determine if there 
16 
should be an amendment?   
17 
Anyone want to field that? 
18 
MR. EDWARDS:  Sure.  I don't mind.  So we have 
19 
sued not only the estate but several corporate entities.  
20 
And we would at least need 30(b)(6) depositions from the 
21 
corporate entities to learn what other related corporations 
22 
performed certain similar acts that we've alleged against 
23 
these corporate entities in their negligence of simply 
24 
enabling Mr. Epstein's abuse.  I think that it would go a 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 23 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
24 
long way to get a 30(b)(6) deposition of the estate, as 
2 
well. 
3 
THE COURT:  Could you do this by way of 
4 
interrogatory? 
5 
MR. EDWARDS:  We could.  We actually expected, 
6 
especially given how long of extensions were given in order 
7 
to -- or how much time passed before initial disclosures, 
8 
we expected to get a lot of that information in initial 
9 
disclosures in terms of what other witnesses were available 
10 
and what other documents pertained to each one of our 
11 
clients.  Instead, we got back that there are none. 
12 
Now, I realize with initial disclosures the 
13 
position being taken is there are no documents that we 
14 
intend to produce to support our defenses, and we don't 
15 
necessarily have to give you right now what you're asking 
16 
for in terms of what's relevant to the claim.  So we're 
17 
going to have to at least propound discovery.  I imagine if 
18 
the current circumstance carries on in terms of what I feel 
19 
is a lack of production, that we're going to get basically 
20 
nothing, and then we're going to be left taking 30(b)(6) 
21 
depositions, anyway, so that at least get a human being on 
22 
the other side of the table to tell us what you know, what 
23 
you don't know and why you don't know anything.  Because 
24 
right now we're not being given any information, which just 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 24 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
25 
is totally unreasonable, especially given the breadth of 
2 
documents that we who have litigated these similar cases 
3 
know exist out there. 
4 
For instance, I would expect flight logs that have 
5 
my clients on them to have been listed as some documents 
6 
that would be used either as a defense or that could 
7 
possibly be relevant to the claims.  Instead we're getting 
8 
back there are no documents.  There are emails on 
9 
Mr. Epstein's server.  Somebody has to be in possession or 
10 
control of those emails, but the appearance that we're 
11 
being given is that it's nobody. 
12 
So if we continue down this course of having to 
13 
kind of pry open every single fact and detail, it's going 
14 
to take us a little while.  And that's why when we were 
15 
negotiating a discovery schedule, I was asking for the 
16 
amendment or the -- for the amendment of the complaint to 
17 
be three months down the road for this exact point.  I need 
18 
a lot of information, at least some information, in order 
19 
to know what parties to add to this complaint or what 
20 
causes of action need to be amended. 
21 
THE COURT:  So a couple of you have -- actually 
22 
for three of plaintiffs' counsel, Ms. Kaplan, Ms. Wang, and 
23 
Edwards, I believe, you seem to have an agreement on a 
24 
motion to amend deadline, which is not very far away.

They're not identical, but they're in March.  What makes 
2 
you think that makes sense? 
3 
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, we don't anticipate any 
4 
amendments in our case.  We perceive intent to go against 
5 
the estate.  We don't think it's worth our client's time or 
6 
money to be looking into other entities.  The estate has 
7 
more than sufficient assets to satisfy any judgment here. 
8 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
9 
MS. KAPLAN:  So in our case we're very differently 
10 
positioned than Mr. Edwards, and 30 days is more than 
11 
enough for us. 
12 
MS. WANG:  And, your Honor, we take a slightly 
13 
middle-road view -- Mariann Wang for three of the 
14 
plaintiffs -- we put the standard date down that the 
15 
district judges have marked on our cases has -- primarily 
16 
because we don't anticipate amending; and if we do, it 
17 
would be because we've really obtained new information that 
18 
makes us think that actually the estate is not the right 
19 
defendant.  So we don't really anticipate amending; 
20 
otherwise, we would do it not by right or -- you know, we 
21 
would just make a motion that some new information came 
22 
out.  But we would anticipate as a general matter in terms 
23 
of -- and maybe I'm jumping ahead -- in terms of number of 
24 
witnesses on our side probably having about three to five, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 26 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
27 
more like three, per plaintiffs' side, so a plaintiff and 
2 
representatives of either therapists or medical providers 
3 
or individual emotional-harm witness.  And then on the 
4 
other side, I would anticipate doing very early 30(b)(6)s 
5 
similarly to determine who if any is going to be put up or 
6 
who we would want to put up on the defense side at trial, 
7 
because right now we similarly are getting nothing out of 
8 
initial disclosures or any kind of information from the 
9 
estate about who is relevant for our clients' claims. 
10 
THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  I threw out a lot 
11 
of questions at once, so let's take them in pieces.  For 
12 
plaintiffs deposing defendants -- well, for what 
13 
plaintiffs need from defendants, documents, depositions, 
14 
how voluminous are the demands that plaintiffs are 
15 
planning to make on defendants, and how many witnesses are 
16 
you looking for from defendants? 
17 
MS. KAPLAN:  Again, your Honor, I think there's 
18 
going to be -- you're going to see great variation, you 
19 
know, which is what you see in the proposed schedules.  
20 
I'm not sure we need a 30(b)(6) from the estate.  My 
21 
client knows what happened; she knows who was responsible.  
22 
I think maybe two witnesses on their side, both of whom I 
23 
assume will plead the Fifth.  They're really non-parties, 
24 
the two women who did scheduling for Mr. Epstein.  And 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
28 
maybe three witnesses on our side, and that's the whole 
2 
thing.  I -- 
3 
THE COURT:  How about documents? 
4 
MS. KAPLAN:  Any documents they have relating to 
5 
our client, and that's it.  We're talking -- I mean, I 
6 
find myself -- 
7 
THE COURT:  You're looking for something much  
8 
more streamlined? 
9 
MS. KAPLAN:  Yeah, I find it very unusual for 
10 
myself saying this, having spent 20 years as a partner of 
11 
Paul Weiss, but this is not a case from our perspective 
12 
that's going to take very much discovery or take very long 
13 
to get to trial.  She'll take the stand and she'll testify 
14 
about what happened.  We'll put on an expert.  There may 
15 
be one or two corroborating witnesses.  And that's the 
16 
whole thing. 
17 
THE COURT:  And some of you are looking for a 
18 
lot of documents, and you're talking about potentially a  
19 
number of witnesses, right?  Who's looking for a lot of 
20 
documents from defendants?  I've heard flight logs and 
21 
emails. 
22 
MS. McCAWLEY:  This is -- yeah, this is Sigrid 
23 
McCawley from Bois Schiller.  I think "a lot of documents" 
24 
may not be the correct characterization, but certainly we

29 
put forth in our Rule 26 disclosures a good, substantial 
2 
amount of information that we know exists based on the 
3 
work that we've done over the last several years.  So 
4 
we've already identified that as a body of documents 
5 
that's relevant to the case.  But what we don't have, your 
6 
Honor, is the information that we know exists from Jeffrey 
7 
Epstein's electronic files.  For example, he had 
8 
MindSpring accounts, he had house electronic accounts that

he used to communicate with the employees, all of which he 
10 
claimed the Fifth before he passed away.  So we have never 
11 
obtained those in discovery unless it came from another 
12 
individual who was copied on an email.  We know that he 
13 
used other aliases for his email addresses, things of that 
14 
nature, all of which is now accessible and that we want.  
15 
So we are going to seek that in discovery.  It will be 
16 
streamlined in the sense it will be responsive to our 
17 
clients' claims and the claims that they have and the 
18 
trafficking that was occurring with Jeffrey Epstein and 
19 
his co-conspirators. 
20 
Similarly, with respect to witnesses, we 
21 
anticipate that we will call not only someone from the 
22 
estate but a number of the co-conspirators that were 
23 
involved.  We anticipate many of them will take the Fifth, 
24 
as they have in the past.  And then on our side we will

have supportive witnesses, witnesses who saw our clients 
2 
in the places that they say they were; obviously, our 
3 
clients themselves to substantiate those claims; and a 
4 
very limited number of experts. 
5 
THE COURT:  When you say "a number of witnesses 
6 
on defendants' side, some of whom would take the Fifth," 
7 
what are you talking about by "a number"? 
8 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Just a couple.  I mean, really 
9 
the, you know, the main -- in my view, the main people who 
10 
were part of the operation.  So you have Sarah Kellen, who 
11 
was copied on documents with my clients; Leslie Groff, as 
12 
well, who was doing the scheduling, communicating between 
13 
my clients and Jeffrey Epstein.  So individuals that we 
14 
believe were facilitating this along with Jeffrey Epstein 
15 
would be part of our case. 
16 
THE COURT:  Any possibility for having multiple 
17 
lawyers sit in on any particular depositions? 
18 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, we have five cases 
19 
before you.  We're happy to coordinate with other 
20 
plaintiffs' lawyers and have those, for example, if it's a 
21 
30(b)(6), have those coordinated.  We would, of course, 
22 
want an allocated amount of time to be able to take care 
23 
of our cases, but we would coordinate that certainly to 
24 
make sure that we're streamlining that process.

MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, one thing that may be 
2 
helpful in that regard, Ms. Kellen and Groff, if we get an 
3 
early -- if we can get an early indication, which we 
4 
assume has to be the case if they're going to take the 
5 
Fifth, those are the only two witnesses that I would even 
6 
share with some of these other cases.  Then I don't -- you 
7 
know, we may just be able to streamline that right out of 
8 
the way. 
9 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, your Honor. 
10 
Well, to go back to -- but I'll try to hit on 
11 
what matters most.  First, this notion that we're somehow 
12 
not -- we're stonewalling.  These were initial 
13 
disclosures.  Mr. Edwards was correct when he said that 
14 
the rule is very clear; the parties have to disclose 
15 
things that they may use for their claims or defenses.  A 
16 
lot of people kind of gloss past that and give short 
17 
shrift to initial disclosures, but that's what they are so 
18 
they can't sandbag people.  And it's hardly surprising 
19 
that as an attorney for executors of an estate and not the 
20 
alleged tort feasor himself, that after due diligence that 
21 
we're all required to do as counsel with regard to initial 
22 
disclosures for the most part, but it's not true as to 
23 
every action -- but for the most part, I don't have such 
24 
information or people to disclose at this time.  It's not 
25

32 
that unusual.  
2 
I actually agree with a lot of what Ms. Kaplan 
3 
said in terms of how she views the scope of discovery.  And 
4 
that shows why the cases where people have a much broader 
5 
scope, relatively speaking, should not proceed on the same 
6 
track.  So in terms of the Bois Schiller cases -- because 
7 
what we've done, and I'm sure your Honor appreciated this, 
8 
is we were on the plaintiffs' side we negotiated discovery 
9 
schedules with each set of plaintiffs' attorneys.  And we 
10 
think it makes sense for there to be coordination in those 
11 
actions for, say deposition.  I will say we are not in 
12 
favor of people sharing discovery with each other across 
13 
the cases.  We think that puts plaintiffs at an unfair 
14 
advantage if something's disclosed because it pertains to 
15 
person X's claims but doesn't pertain to person Y, person Y 
16 
shouldn't get a free shot at discovery.  I'll just throw 
17 
that out there for now because it came up.  
18 
But in terms of the scope, yeah, the initial 
19 
disclosures were actually quite -- 
20 
THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  You would rather 
21 
have one of your witnesses deposed multiple times rather 
22 
than have one deposition where multiple lawyers sit in? 
23 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, it depends how long the 
24 
deposition is, same what the scope is.  So related to that, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 32 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
33 
the Bois Schiller firm has a much broader scope, according 
2 
to their initial disclosures, of what they want here.  They 
3 
listed dozens -- dozens -- of people and categories of 
4 
documents:  movie stars, politicians.  That's fine.  If 
5 
that's their disclosure, fine; but you don't get to proceed 
6 
then, from our view, on the same track as someone like 
7 
Ms. Kaplan, who says, "I'm not doing all that."  It just 
8 
doesn't -- it doesn't seem reasonable to us for those kinds 
9 
of different views to proceed on the same track.  And I 
10 
don't see, to your Honor's question, how you can have a 
11 
single tenable deposition of a representative of the estate 
12 
when one person says these 20 categories are in the scope 
13 
and another plaintiff's attorney says, "I just need to know 
14 
about my client's allegations," which by the way -- and, 
15 
again, I think Ms. Kaplan's view is the more reasonable 
16 
one. 
17 
And if I can -- I think it's related -- pardon me 
18 
for just an extra moment.  You know, one of the other cases 
19 
that I don't think lines up with the others and which you 
20 
may have discerned a disagreement, there's relatively 
21 
speaking, I think there is a lot of -- more agreement than 
22 
disagreement in the proposed discovery schedules.  And one 
23 
place where we don't see eye to eye with the Bois Schiller 
24 
firm is that in the Annie Farmer case they sued defendant 
25

Maxwell.  They've made a motion to approve alternate 
2 
service.  I don't know what the status is.  I don't believe 
3 
there's been an opposition yet.  I don't know if one's due 
4 
yet.  But I don't see why that case should move forward at 
5 
the same pace with discovery when, as they stated in their 
6 
papers, it's inevitable in their mind that Maxwell will 
7 
have to deal with this case.  So they're going to have 
8 
another defendant who might have nothing to do with coming 
9 
after things are already done and then want to do 
10 
depositions and document requests.  We just said hey, why 
11 
don't we build in some extra time, an extra 30 days of our 
12 
proposal for that action, which I think is absolutely 
13 
reasonable, given where they stand with serving Maxwell. 
14 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, just two things very 
15 
briefly.  First on the characterization of our discovery, I 
16 
want to be very clear we took our Rule 26 disclosure 
17 
responsibilities very seriously, and we identified those 
18 
individuals who witnessed the crime, were around at the 
19 
time, would have information that's relevant -- directly 
20 
relevant to those claims.  So they are fulsome in the sense 
21 
that we took that obligation seriously, and we put that 
22 
forth in our disclosures.  That's different than who we 
23 
will necessarily call at trial, but we did comply with that 
24 
obligation.  So he's talking about politicians and famous 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 34 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
35 
people.  That is just the realm of what was going on in the 
2 
circumstance, so if one of our clients came into contact 
3 
with that person, they were listed on the Rule 26 
4 
disclosures. 
5 
With respect to Maxwell, our motion for 
6 
alternative service is -- under the general reference order 
7 
is before your Honor.  We have had that same issue in other 
8 
cases.  In Judge Koeltl's case, similarly, she would not 
9 
accept service, and we got the motion for alternative 
10 
service granted there.  She has active counsel litigating 
11 
in front of Judge Preska two weeks ago, fighting to not 
12 
disclose documents.  This is not an individual who cannot 
13 
be -- who is not found through her counsel.  While we can't 
14 
physically find her right now, she is actively litigating 
15 
in this courthouse.  And so what we've asked this Court to 
16 
do is grant alternative service, which we think is 
17 
abundantly reasonable, considering that we've served her in 
18 
her email address, we've tried to go to the locations where 
19 
we knew she had a residence, and we've approached her 
20 
counsel, not only through email and phone, but also in 
21 
person, and were denied the acceptance of service.  So we 
22 
believe that, you know, this is not supposed to be a cat-
23 
and-mouse chase; it's something where a defendant of this 
24 
kind, through their counsel, should accept service.  And we 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
36 
believe we've taken all the steps necessary to move that 
2 
forward.  So we don't think that should be an impediment to 
3 
moving discovery forward in our case. 
4 
THE COURT:  All right. 
5 
MS. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, I forgot to mention one 
6 
thing, and I should mention it.  The U.S. Attorney's Office 
7 
of the Southern District is -- obviously is in possession 
8 
of a lot of documents relevant to these claims, has been 
9 
very cooperative and has told us all that there's a 
10 
procedure where we can put in a form, and whatever 
11 
documents they have, subject to grand jury secrecy 
12 
requirements, will be produced in the cases.  I just wanted 
13 
to give them those kudos. 
14 
THE COURT:  All right.  Just as a side note, the 
15 
two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of 
16 
what's happening in the Virgin Islands, they may end up 
17 
unstayed.  So I'm just going to address those separately 
18 
since I don't have those counsel here today.  We may need 
19 
to get them on -- I'll just tell defense counsel we may 
20 
need to get them on a discovery track, as well. 
21 
All right, so thank you, all, for background.  I 
22 
have, I don't know how many cases at this point, 16, maybe, 
23 
in front of me.   
24 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I counted 15, your Honor.

PROCEEDINGS 
37 
THE COURT:  Well, there's going to be 16 because 
2 
the one that was just filed before Judge Koeltl -- 
3 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Koeltl, okay.  Then that would 
4 
be -- 
5 
THE COURT:  -- I'm pretty sure that that's -- 
6 
that was designated to Judge Moses; it will be redesignated 
7 
to me.  And I'm fairly certain Judge Koeltl will refer for 
8 
general pretrial supervision, so -- and I think I have 
9 
local counsel, at least, right here just as an observer 
10 
today.  So you might want to meet each other and talk about 
11 
the case briefly. 
12 
Of these cases, a number of them are pending 
13 
before district judges who have preferences in their 
14 
individual rules regarding timelines for discovery, which 
15 
may not be the same as what I typically do.  Some of them 
16 
do not.  Judge Gardephe has the most stringent 
17 
requirements.  He generally likes fact discovery done in 
18 
three months' time.  Judges, as I have reviewed it, Nathan, 
19 
Castel, Failla, Engelmayer, Schofield, Liman, and Woods 
20 
like fact discovery done within four months, 120 days.  And 
21 
then there are a few judges who don't seem to have the 
22 
individual preferences stated in their own scheduling 
23 
orders that they like to put in place. 
24 
Given that I guess the majority of the district 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 37 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
38 
judges whose cases these are ultimately like to see fact 
2 
discovery within no more than four months' time, 120 days, 
3 
and that pretty much accords with the range that I would -- 
4 
I might go a little longer in some cases if they're really 
5 
complex, I might go five or six, but four or less is 
6 
certainly fine with me.  It seems to me for starters I 
7 
shouldn't go beyond the 120 days for fact discovery. 
8 
Now, let me just say this about any discovery 
9 
deadlines that I set.  A couple of things.  One, it is not 
10 
uncommon for lawyers to ask for extensions.  Here is my 
11 
general philosophy and approach with respect to requested 
12 
discovery extensions.  If you've been making diligent 
13 
efforts to get discovery done, if something outside your 
14 
control holds it up, you know, you're looking for documents 
15 
from a third party who's being recalcitrant, someone falls 
16 
ill, you know, something happens that really is not a 
17 
matter of the parties not trying hard and counsel not 
18 
trying hard, I'm reasonably generous about extensions.  If 
19 
it looks like you've been sitting on your hands, not really 
20 
trying, then I'm less generous about extensions.  So if you 
21 
ask for an extension, expect to show me why you need it, 
22 
that there's some good reason for it. 
23 
Settlement is another reason why it might make 
24 
sense to extend the deadlines, even to stay deadlines, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 38 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
39 
depending upon what's going on.  I don't want people to be 
2 
wasting resources if cases are legitimately capable of 
3 
being settled and if parties are seriously working on it 
4 
and have some degree of optimism.  If it looks pointless, 
5 
there's no reason to stay a case or put things on hold or 
6 
extend out deadlines; but if things get on track and you 
7 
really want to focus on that instead of spending the 
8 
resources on discovery, especially if it's joint, you come 
9 
to me together and say, "This is what we are doing," I will 
10 
certainly take a good look at that and may well move your 
11 
deadlines out to give you a window to try to get the case 
12 
resolved.   
13 
The other point I would make about discovery 
14 
deadlines is especially when settlement is a possibility is 
15 
that there is no magic about how discovery must be 
16 
structured.  People tend to go in kind of a lockstep order.  
17 
And it makes sense you want documents produced before 
18 
depositions so you can put the documents in front of the 
19 
witnesses at depositions; everyone understands that.  But 
20 
there may be reasons why it makes sense to do something 
21 
earlier and something else later, including the cost of it.  
22 
If you're trying to save some resources and you think some 
23 
particular discovery is more costly, you want to put it 
24 
out, if an expert would be really useful for some reason, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 39 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
40 
usually that starts out in the process.  Here I'm not sure 
2 
how that works with this concept of a fund and claims.  But 
3 
there's no absolute reason why you must go exactly in a 
4 
certain order.  What we usually look for is are you all 
5 
done by a certain point in time, not how did you get there. 
6 
So if you want to modify interim deadlines among yourselves 
7 
by stipulation, that's fine with me if the end comes in the 
8 
same place.  So, for example, on a deadline for a motion to 
9 
amend, if I set a deadline, again, most of these judges 
10 
have or many of them have sample scheduling orders that 
11 
have 30 days.  To me that doesn't make a huge amount of 
12 
sense if there's really a potential for amendment because 
13 
you at least, I would think, would need to serve initial 
14 
document requests for interrogatories and get the responses 
15 
back.  But if you want to by stipulation agree to move 
16 
something -- and you can always request to move an interim 
17 
deadline if you can't get them to step on it -- what I care 
18 
about more is where the end date comes out, where you're 
19 
all ready to move onto the next stage.   
20 
So I'm going to start with that end date of 120 
21 
days in most of the cases, and I'll hear about exceptions 
22 
when there should be exceptions, and then talk about 
23 
interim deadlines within that period.  That 120 days seems 
24 
to have been agreed in Ms. Kaplan's case.  There seems to 
25

have been different proposals set forward in Ms. Wang's 
2 
cases.  Plaintiff was proposing June 10, which would be 
3 
about that four-month period.  Defendants were saying 
4 
instead of June 10, June 30.  I'm not sure I understand 
5 
what the difference is realistically between June 10 and 
6 
June 30.  It's 20 days different.  It doesn't seem to me to 
7 
be huge at this point in the game.  Why are you not 
8 
agreeing on June 10 there and saying June 30?  And in the 
9 
case with Mr. Edwards, I've got June 30 as the agree date.  
10 
Why did you kick it out beyond June 10? 
11 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  So for -- I agree that the 
12 
20 days doesn't really matter as much with respect to that 
13 
one deadline.  The difference with Ms. Wang that we had was 
14 
kind of sequential over the whole period.  And one of the 
15 
differences we had that then impacted going backwards was, 
16 
you know -- and some of the district judges do have this; I 
17 
don't understand it.  They insist -- Ms. Wang's firm 
18 
insisted that expert reports coincide with the completion 
19 
of fact discovery.  I don't get that.  You should finish 
20 
discovery first and then, say, have 30 days for experts to 
21 
then, based on all discovery, once it's completed, render 
22 
initial reports and then have, in a case where it's not the 
23 
most simple expert testimony, which this is not among 
24 
those, in our view, have another 30 days for rebuttal 
25

reports.  We had disagreement on that.  It kind of impacted 
2 
everything from the start back to that point. 
3 
MR. WINTER:  Just to be clear, we weren't saying 
4 
that the expert discovery had to be finished by fact 
5 
discovery; we were following the approach that the district 
6 
judges had, which is fact discovery within four months, and 
7 
then that ends also with the disclosures of the names of 
8 
the experts, and then an additional period of time for the 
9 
expert discovery. 
10 
THE COURT:  No, both of your proposals -- just in 
11 
your case, Ms. Wang, both your proposals have an expert 
12 
discovery period following the close of fact discovery. 
13 
MS. WANG:  Right. 
14 
THE COURT:  You had June 10 and July 27.  You had 
15 
June 30 and August 31. 
16 
MS. WANG:  Yes. 
17 
THE COURT:  So just starting with the June 10 and 
18 
June 30 -- and I'll also note that the parties seem to have 
19 
agreed with June 30 in the five cases that Mr. Edwards has.  
20 
Why June 30 when you've got all these judges that are 
21 
saying -- 
22 
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, we proposed 120 days, 
23 
and we're trying to bring to you an agreement.  I couldn't 
24

thought okay, 20 days is not the biggest deal, so to the 
2 
extent that we can agree.  But we would much prefer 120 
3 
days, and so -- 
4 
THE COURT:  All right, look, unless we have a 
5 
case with an exception, I'm going to go with the 120 days, 
6 
which will take us to, I'm assuming June 10.  And so many 
7 
people came up with that date, I'm assuming that is the 
8 
120-day mark.  And, like I said, if you really need it, you 
9 
can get an extension based on an actual need.   
10 
Hold on for a minute on expert discovery -- we'll 
11 
talk about that separately. 
12 
The case where Ms. Maxwell has been named -- 
13 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Annie Farmer, that's the -- 
14 
THE COURT:  Right, right.  That case, that 
15 
motion, is in front of me.  I've taken a quick look at it.  
16 
I haven't taken a thorough look at it.  My initial reaction 
17 
is I'll likely grant the motion.  I don't think it ought to 
18 
hold up the discovery schedule.  If there really is certain 
19 
discovery in that case where you are concerned that if an 
20 
attorney for Ms. Maxwell shows up on the scene is going to 
21 
want to redo a deposition, you should be talking in that 
22 
particular case about a scheduling of a particular 
23 
deposition or something so it doesn't have to be redone.  
24 
All right.  But I don't think that that should alter the 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 43 of 67

44 
basic time frame unless and until something happens that 
2 
throws it off course. 
3 
As I understand on that case -- and I don't really 
4 
want to hear argument on that motion particularly -- but I 
5 
gather you have made efforts to locate her and have been 
6 
unable to do so? 
7 
MS. McCAWLEY:  That's correct, your Honor.  We -- 
8 
through investigation and also the other sources that we 
9 
had of information of where she has been living. 
10 
THE COURT:  Yes, I'm likely going to approve the 
11 
alternate service, and I'll try to do that relatively soon.  
12 
If I've had a problem with it, I will let counsel know; if 
13 
I have a change of heart before I -- you're suddenly going 
14 
(indiscernible). 
15 
All right, so amendments, deadlines for 
16 
amendments.  First of all, initial disclosures, if you've 
17 
already done them, great.  If you haven't already done 
18 
them, within two weeks of today would be, I think, sensible 
19 
for everybody.  Does anybody have a problem with that? 
20 
MR. EDWARDS:  No, your Honor. 
21 
MS. McCAWLEY:  No, your Honor. 
22 
THE COURT:  No.  All right.  So two weeks from 
23 
today is what?  Today is what, February 11?  So February 25 
24 
for initial disclosures.  Once you get in the initial 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 44 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
45 
disclosures, which you already have in some cases, you 
2 
should know what it is you need to ask for that you haven't 
3 
already gotten.  So I want a deadline for getting out your 
4 
initial document requests and your initial interrogatories.  
5 
I will let you all go outside of Local Rule 33.3A -- is it 
6 
A? -- with the three categories of interrogatories.  The 
7 
first category of interrogatories, those really basic ones; 
8 
and the second category, sort of what you ask throughout 
9 
the rest of discovery; and the last category, the 
10 
contention interrogatories, I'll let you skip the first 
11 
category to have things move a little bit more efficiently.  
12 
I really don't like those objections where you refuse to 
13 
answer because it goes outside the local rule.  Because all  
14 
one has to do is serve another set, and then you have to 
15 
answer.  So it seems silly.   That ought to help speed you 
16 
up a little bit.  That doesn't mean use interrogatories 
17 
improperly.  Don't ask interrogatories that call for long, 
18 
narrative responses; you know, be sensible.  But hopefully 
19 
that will help the parties figure out if there is a 
20 
potential amendment before the need for a 3(b)(6) witness, 
21 
hopefully. 
22 
So you get in your initial disclosures.  Some 
23 
already have; others will have them by the 25th.  The 
24 
deadlines for getting out your initial document requests 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 45 of 67

and interrogatories should be soon after that.  And, you 
2 
know, a week after that would be March 3; two weeks after 
3 
that would be March 10.  Is there any reason you can't get 
4 
those out, just the requests for things? 
5 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's fine.  And I do have a 
6 
question about that, your Honor.  Ms. Wang served us before 
7 
we even submitted to your Honor a joint proposed discovery 
8 
schedule with discovery requests.  I'm not going to rehash 
9 
how we strongly found that to be improper.  What should the 
10 
deadline be for those? 
11 
THE COURT:  Right. 
12 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We agreed that, to avoid burdening 
13 
your Honor, we agreed we'll -- 
14 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.   
15 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  -- give it by February 28, but -- 
16 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  Any issue -- if I set a 
17 
deadline for the requests to go out, any problem with 
18 
having those deemed to have been served as of that date? 
19 
MS. WANG:  Well, your Honor, I just want to say we 
20 
very carefully and thoroughly conducted a Rule 26(f) on 
21 
January 8, and we then served discovery requests, which the 
22 
rules allow for, on January 15.  We didn't say you have to 
23 
respond in 30 days.  We came to an agreement with them that 
24 
they would respond by February 28.  So I don't see why we 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 46 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
47 
can't stick to the agreement.   
2 
We're also going to get document requests from 
3 
them and respond as quickly as possible.  They've agreed 
4 
that they would respond by the 28th, by February 28th, so I 
5 
don't see -- 
6 
THE COURT:  No problem with that? 
7 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's fine, but I do want to 
8 
correct.  Yes, they did say 30 days.  And I'm happy to 
9 
share all correspondence with your Honor where we said, 
10 
well, we need more time.  And we thought -- and I can ask 
11 
the Court now -- that it stood to reason that, since your 
12 
Honor had said that one of the things that should be 
13 
negotiated between counsel and then addressed with the 
14 
Court were initial service of discovery requests -- that 
15 
was in your order -- that it didn't make sense to us that 
16 
you could already serve requests and it was improper.  So I 
17 
would like the additional time, actually. 
18 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  If you've already agreed 
19 
that you can respond to these things by February 28, is 
20 
there some reason you cannot? 
21 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  It's very burdensome.  It can be 
22 
done.  If we had a little more time, it would be better. 
23 
THE COURT:  Is it burdensome to the extent that 
24 
you feel you need to negotiate the scope, in which case you 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 47 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
48 
should be conferring in good faith to negotiate the scope? 
2 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We will do so.  That is part of 
3 
the problem. 
4 
THE COURT:  Well, respond to the extent you're 
5 
able to do so by the 28th, since you've already agreed to 
6 
that.  I'm not going to undo that agreement.  And in 
7 
general, if you have -- what do I have here on these 
8 
different proposals?  Let me set them out next to each 
9 
other.  You have March 12 for the most part; you're 
10 
agreeing to serve by March 12, is that right?  Am I reading 
11 
this right, counsel? 
12 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I'm sorry, I don't know what your 
13 
Honor's looking at. 
14 
THE COURT:  Requests -- I'm sorry -- a deadline 
15 
for service of initial document requests and 
16 
interrogatories.  You gave me different variations of 
17 
proposals.  I'm trying to summarize them and put them next 
18 
to each other.  Am I looking at the right date, that you 
19 
were agreeing to do that by March 12? 
20 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  With -- I trust you mean in 
21 
Ms. Wang's actions? 
22 
THE COURT:  No. 
23 
MS. WANG:  No. 
24 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's my confusion.

PROCEEDINGS 
49 
MS. WANG:  I don't believe for most of our judges 
2 
we only needed to put in a discovery deadline.  And then, 
3 
as your Honor advised, we can sort of work throughout 
4 
within those four months how things are done.  But I don't 
5 
believe there's a deadline for that, but -- (Stopped 
6 
talking.) 
7 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley 
8 
again.  Our five, we did have for the initial 
9 
interrogatories and document requests, the March 12 date.  
10 
And then they had proposed -- they didn't agree with that 
11 
one because 60 days from the entry. 
12 
THE COURT:  I thought a few of you had proposed 
13 
March 12. 
14 
MS. KAPLAN:  Yes, we had proposed 30 days from 
15 
entry of the order, as well, your Honor. 
16 
THE COURT:  Which would be March 12? 
17 
MS. KAPLAN:  If I'm looking at the date correctly, 
18 
yes. 
19 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So, look, here's what makes 
20 
sense to me.  You get your initial disclosures done.  If 
21 
you've already done them, great; if not, by two weeks.  Two 
22 
weeks is February 25.  At most, the initial requests should 
23 
go out within two weeks after you get back -- after you get 
24 
in the initial disclosures.  You see what you've got, you 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 49 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
50 
figure out what else you need, you serve your requests.  If 
2 
you can do it sooner, that would be great.  If you can do 
3 
it within a week of that, that's March 3.  If you need two 
4 
weeks, March 10.  I'll go with March 10, since a lot of you 
5 
are proposing March 12.  So March 10 for service of initial 
6 
document requests and interrogatories.  If you have already 
7 
agreed to something, in one case perhaps or in a series of 
8 
cases -- I'm not sure -- where the requests were served 
9 
already and you've negotiated a time to respond, live with 
10 
that.  If you have issues that come up along the way, 
11 
you'll raise them.  So if you get them out by March 12 -- 
12 
I'm sorry -- by March 10, you're going to get in responses 
13 
to those hopefully by April 9. 
14 
Now, here's the thing:  the motion to amend 
15 
deadline.  You're getting in those responses by April 9.  
16 
It doesn't make sense to me to have a motion to amend 
17 
deadline of a month earlier than that.  It just doesn't 
18 
really make sense.  So I am -- and here's another thing 
19 
about that.  If there's a motion to amend -- I'm sorry -- 
20 
if there's a proposed amendment and your adversary isn't 
21 
going to fight it, isn't going to oppose it if you make a 
22 
motion, I'm not going to require you to make the motion.  
23 
It's silly.  There's not going to be an opposition.  So if 
24 
you think you have a potential amendment, draft it up, send 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 50 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
51 
it to your adversary saying, "Would you oppose it?"  If the 
2 
answer is, "No, I wouldn't oppose it," just let me know 
3 
there would not be an opposition.  It's not the same thing 
4 
as consenting; it's just not opposing.  If there's not 
5 
going to be an opposition, I'll just take it for filing; I 
6 
will not require a motion.  If there is going to be an 
7 
opposition, then I need a motion for leave to amend. 
8 
So the deadline I want to set is for motions.  So 
9 
you have to back it up in your head and think, I have to 
10 
draft it, send it to my adversary, give him a chance to let 
11 
me know if he's objecting or not; if there is an objection, 
12 
I've got to draft up a motion.  So if you're getting in the 
13 
responses to the initial document requests and 
14 
interrogatories in the middle of April and you need time to 
15 
figure out if there is an amendment, logically, end of 
16 
April makes sense for motions to amend.  I'd be inclined to 
17 
set April 30 for that deadline.  Anybody have a problem 
18 
with that? 
19 
MR. EDWARDS:  No, your Honor. 
20 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No, your Honor. 
21 
THE COURT:  All right, April 30.  And the reason 
22 
why I'm doing it and not sticking with the earlier date is 
23 
because I know we have at least one amendment in one case.  
24 
I'm seeing different names of different defendants in these 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 51 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
52 
cases.  I think there is a possibility in at least some of 
2 
the cases.  If there's not going to be an amendment, fine; 
3 
the date comes, the date goes, there's no amendment.   
4 
If you need more time to figure out if there is an 
5 
amendment, put your hand in the air before that date comes 
6 
and ask for it to be extended.  That deadline in 
7 
particular, of all the deadlines in a case scheduling 
8 
order, can come back and bite you because under Rule 15, 
9 
amendments are very freely granted in the court.  But under 
10 
Rule 16, if you miss a deadline in a scheduling order, you 
11 
have to show good cause why you couldn't have met the 
12 
deadline.  So if you miss a deadline for a motion to amend, 
13 
you're not in Rule 15 land anymore, you are in Rule 16 land 
14 
first.  If you can't show good cause, that leave to amend 
15 
is freely given standard can go out the window.  All right?  
16 
So if something comes up that you really could not have 
17 
anticipated, some new name of some new person or new entity 
18 
you couldn't have known about comes up late, you'll have 
19 
good cause and you'll be able to meet a Rule 16 standard.  
20 
But if it's something where it's right there in the 
21 
document staring you in the face earlier, someone might say 
22 
hey, you could have anticipated that sooner, you may be 
23 
stuck under Rule 16 not being able to show good cause for a 
24 
late amendment.  So if you really think you might need to 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 52 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
53 
amend and you really are worried about that deadline, say 
2 
something before it runs, don't wait until later because 
3 
you may end up being caught.  All right?  It's another 
4 
reason to move it out a little bit further so we try to 
5 
avoid those issues. 
6 
All right, close of fact discovery, June 10.  I'll 
7 
deal with any exceptions, if you think your case has some 
8 
extraordinary reason why these shouldn't be the deadlines, 
9 
separately.  But for the most part, June 10.    
10 
And expert discovery, what kind of experts are we 
11 
talking about here?  On plaintiffs' side, what kind of 
12 
experts? 
13 
MS. WANG:  For my plaintiffs, it would be 
14 
emotional harm, mental health experts. 
15 
THE COURT:  All right, anyone else have any other 
16 
sort of experts in mind? 
17 
MS. McCAWLEY:  And that's the same for us, as 
18 
well. 
19 
THE COURT:  And how about defendants' side, what 
20 
kind of experts do you think you might -- 
21 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  It would be rebuttal experts, your 
22 
Honor. 
23 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So are you confident that you 
24 
would have such experts; it's just a matter of waiting to 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 53 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
54 
see what plaintiffs' experts say?  So, in other words, 
2 
okay, you would want to have examinations done? 
3 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, correct. 
4 
THE COURT:  Do you want for the examinations to 
5 
have the plaintiffs' reports in hand before the 
6 
examinations are done? 
7 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That's exactly right, your Honor, 
8 
to understand specifically.  I mean, one of the issues 
9 
we're having, discovery hasn't started yet in earnest, so 
10 
it's not something to fully address now, but is a lack of 
11 
understanding of what are the alleged damages, in which 
12 
category, which is, unfortunately, a sneak preview, 
13 
something that I don't see eye to eye with, the 
14 
completeness of initial disclosures in that regard on 
15 
plaintiffs' side.  So to answer your question, yes, for 
16 
those reasons and others, I would like to see the expert 
17 
reports first and have an opportunity to do a full 
18 
rebuttal. 
19 
THE COURT:  All right, and on plaintiffs' side, 
20 
this doesn't sound like the kind of expert that would need 
21 
fully discovery before you can have your clients examined 
22 
and have a report about emotional distress, is that right? 
23 
MS. McCAWLEY:  That's correct. 
24 
MR. EDWARDS:  I think that's right, your Honor.

PROCEEDINGS 
55 
THE COURT:  Because usually, in most cases I 
2 
would say get the fact discovery done, and then 30 days 
3 
after the close of fact discovery, have an expert report.  
4 
That's not really what's needed here? 
5 
MS. McCAWLEY:  No. 
6 
MS. KAPLAN:  That's correct, your Honor. 
7 
MS. WANG:  That's correct. 
8 
THE COURT:  Is there any case represented by any 
9 
plaintiffs' counsel where you don't think you could get out 
10 
the expert report the same time the fact discovery is done? 
11 
MS. McCAWLEY:  I think that's fine. 
12 
THE COURT:  Does anyone think that's going to be 
13 
a problem, to get it done by June 1?  Then I can have 
14 
defendants 30 days after that, and we're not too slowed 
15 
down. 
16 
MR. EDWARDS:  Okay. 
17 
THE COURT:  Yes? 
18 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Right. 
19 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
20 
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you. 
21 
THE COURT:  June 10 for plaintiffs' expert 
22 
reports.  Thirty days thereafter would take us to July 10.  
23 
The good thing about this schedule is you don't end up with 
24 
experts in August.  Having experts in August is almost a 
25

guarantee of falling behind on a schedule.  So July 10 for 
2 
rebuttal experts.  End of July to get these people deposed 
3 
if they're going to be deposed.  July 31?  Close of all 
4 
discovery, July 31. 
5 
I would not be surprised if some of these dates 
6 
move, but that's not an invitation to go slowly.  The only 
7 
invitation to go slowly is if the settlement process heats 
8 
up, and then I expect you to let me know about that and

that it's realistic and that there's, you know, agreement 
10 
on the need to slow down the cases to try to get the 
11 
settlement process moving.  But, other than that, if that's 
12 
still stalled, I don't see any reason why we can't stick to 
13 
a schedule like this. 
14 
Now, on cases where there's any other 
15 
extraordinary circumstances, I already addressed the one 
16 
with the additional defendant who hasn't been served.  
17 
Other than the scope of discovery requests, is there any 
18 
reason why in any of these defendants or anybody else 
19 
thinks there should be a different schedule? 
20 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No, your Honor. 
21 
THE COURT:  Okay.  With respect to the scope of 
22 
discovery, I anticipate some discovery disputes.  Again, 
23 
it's not an invitation; I just expect that they will come 
24 
along.  I enforce the good-faith conference requirement.

57 
By that I mean you have to really talk to each other, and 
2 
you have to really see if you can resolve your discovery 
3 
disputes or at least narrow them before you bring them to 
4 
my attention.  That doesn't mean you send somebody an 
5 
email and you don't get a response right away.  It means 
6 
you pick up the phone, you talk to each other, you work 
7 
through them.  Right?  Pet peeve -- don't have this 
8 
happen -- I get a letter, motion to compel, all this 
9 
detail; I get an opposition, all this detail; I get a 
10 
reply saying in light of what's said in opposition, never 
11 
mind on some of these issues.  I've wasted my time, you've 
12 
wasted your time.  That just tells me there's a failure of 
13 
good-faith conferences.  So, really, on any discovery 
14 
requests, have that conversation.  What's the heart of 
15 
what you're really looking for?  How can we get you that 
16 
without undue burden?  How can we prioritize?  Can we get 
17 
you this first and can we produce the rest on a rolling 
18 
basis?  Here's why this is a burden.  Here are some ideas 
19 
to ways to, you know, alleviate that burden. 
20 
With respect to ESI, you have been -- I'm not sure 
21 
if I've seen things come across my desk or not.  You've 
22 
been talking about protocols? 
23 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We've been negotiating with, 
24 
again, each group of plaintiffs' counsel, protective order, 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 57 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
58 
and have agreed that it makes sense to have a standard ESI 
2 
protocol.  And that -- I believe we're in agreement that 
3 
there should be a standard Clawback Provision in the 
4 
protective order.  So as I sit here now, I don't foresee an 
5 
inability to come to agreement on those issues. 
6 
Don't know how many email accounts you've got 
7 
access to? 
8 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yeah, it's -- among the many 
9 
discussions that counsel need to have with each other are 
10 
what they think needs to be searched, why, etc.  So to 
11 
answer your question, I don't know how many there are that 
12 
matter, if any. 
13 
THE COURT:  Well, if it was something in Jeffrey 
14 
Epstein's control, presumably it needs to be searched, and 
15 
you're going to have to figure out how to get access. 
16 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Correct. 
17 
THE COURT:  But if you've got other individuals, 
18 
if they're named defendants and they have email accounts or 
19 
other social media accounts -- 
20 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I only represent the co-executors 
21 
of the estate related to the alleged torts.  I mean, we've 
22 
heard a lot about these other people who are out there, 
23 
just to be clear for -- 
24 
THE COURT:  There are some other defendants named 
25

PROCEEDINGS 
59 
in some of these papers -- 
2 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, there are entities in 
3 
Mr. Edwards'.  And what I -- to my knowledge -- and I'm 
4 
still looking into it -- I don't think that that changes 
5 
the landscape in those actions in terms of what emails are 
6 
potentially subject to review. 
7 
THE COURT:  But you're representing these 
8 
entities? 
9 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, correct.  They're all part of 
10 
the estate. 
11 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
12 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I was speaking more about -- you 
13 
know, there's been discussion about the addition of 
14 
Maxwell, Kellen and others -- 
15 
THE COURT:  No, I wasn't assuming you were 
16 
representing that person.  Okay. 
17 
MS. KAPLAN:  Judge Freeman -- 
18 
THE COURT:  Yes. 
19 
MS. KAPLAN:  -- one thing that may be helpful -- 
20 
and we've encountered this issue in my Charlottesville 
21 
litigation recently -- is it would be helpful to know from 
22 
the estate whether there are any email accounts or other 
23 
accounts that Mr. Epstein was -- were in his name that they 
24 
do not have passwords to.  In other words, do they actually 
25

60 
have access to be able to search all the email accounts 
2 
that he had, any social media accounts, texts, etc. 
3 
THE COURT:  It's a conference issue first. 
4 
MS. KAPLAN:  Okay. 
5 
THE COURT:  I mean, look, ESI is a subject you 
6 
should be having conversation on.  You don't want to have 
7 
requests, be responding in a limited way, have plaintiffs' 
8 
counsel surprised at the way in which you're responding, 
9 
have them jump up and down and say there were a million 
10 
other accounts that should have been searched.  You know, 
11 
if you see something you anticipate you're not going to be 
12 
able to do everything that's being asked for, well, you 
13 
should be having conversation.  If you know of certain 
14 
accounts and you're concerned there may not be passwords, 
15 
you should be having conversations, try to talk about 
16 
those issues.  If you run into a discovery issue, you have 
17 
conferred fully in good faith, you can't work it out, 
18 
whoever's got the issue, put a letter on ECF and tell me 
19 
what the issue is.  I'll wait for a response.  If I can 
20 
resolve it on paper, I will.  I might just do a text order 
21 
or something if it's easy.  Or I'll set up a conference to 
22 
deal with that issue.  These issues might start varying 
23 
case by case; they might not.  If I'm seeing issues across 
24 
the board or in a number of cases, we'll do something like 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 60 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
61 
this.   
2 
If I'm seeing a discrete issue in a particular 
3 
case, I might have a conference just in that case to deal 
4 
with it, if I need to.  I'm hoping that you are going to 
5 
be able to confer.  You've been able to confer about other 
6 
things so far.  I'm hoping you'll be able to confer on 
7 
discovery disputes and get them at least as narrow as 
8 
possible.  If you really are stuck on something, don't 
9 
send me one of these letters that's all, you know, waving 
10 
your arms around in general terms.  If there's a 
11 
particular request where you think the response is 
12 
inadequate, one side or the other, tell me what the 
13 
request is, tell me what the response was, tell me what 
14 
your discussion has been, tell me where you're stuck; you 
15 
know, let me look at it, let me understand each side's 
16 
position.  Joint letters on discovery are always welcome 
17 
that lay out here's the dispute, here's each side's 
18 
position.  A million letters back and forth and back and 
19 
forth and back and forth endlessly is not welcome.  All 
20 
right.  One letter, one response is fine.  Joint letters 
21 
are great.  You know, suddenly being overwhelmed with, you 
22 
know, 20 letters on one dispute is unnecessary, and I hope 
23 
you will avoid that kind of approach. 
24 
Is it useful to set -- this is a rhetorical 
25

62 
question -- of course, it's useful -- to set a follow-up 
2 
date for a report on how it's going, both with respect to 
3 
settlement and with respect to discovery, just to give me 
4 
an idea of how it's going?  Yes, I think so.  So the 
5 
question is what's the right touch-base point? 
6 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, in terms of the claims 
7 
program issues, I think the next 30 days are going to have 
8 
a lot of movement one way or the other.  I don't 
9 
necessarily know that that's the case with discovery. 
10 
THE COURT:  Well, when there is a meaningful 
11 
development, I think a report would be in order.  So if 
12 
something -- I don't mean every single development, but 
13 
something really significant as in "we're back on track" 
14 
or, you know, "we can't litigate this case anymore because 
15 
the lawyers are not being funded," something significant, 
16 
regardless of any date I set, let me know. 
17 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Okay. 
18 
THE COURT:  Otherwise, maybe we gear it to when 
19 
you're expecting to get responses in on the written 
20 
discovery requests, just to see how things are looking at 
21 
that point, maybe you have a little better idea. 
22 
With respect to deposition -- by the way, what 
23 
was that date?  That was -- that was right, middle of 
24 
April.  Why don't we say end of April?  If nothing else, I 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 62 of 67

63 
get status reports.  I'd welcome clusters of them.   
2 
Whatever makes the most sense.  April 30 for status 
3 
reports, written status reports.  Joint would be nice.  In 
4 
fact, why don't I just say that?  Joint status reports in 
5 
these different cases. 
6 
MS. KAPLAN:  When you say "joint," your Honor, 
7 
you mean plaintiff and defendant? 
8 
THE COURT:  Plaintiff and defendant, right.  So 
9 
you can have -- if you have five cases on plaintiffs' one 
10 
counsel, you can send me one and so it's spread across 
11 
five cases.  If you can do a joint one with all the 
12 
lawyers, that's lovely, but that -- you know, I don't want 
13 
to make things impossible for you.  But at least joint 
14 
with defendant.  The way you did the joint reports on 
15 
settlement was fine.  I had four of them or something.  
16 
That's fine. 
17 
What was I going to say?  I do not remember what 
18 
I was going to say.  What was I going to say?  Was I 
19 
start -- my clerk tells me I was starting to talk about 
20 
depositions.  I don't know what I was going to say.  Oh, I 
21 
do.  So one reason why discovery schedules get extended is 
22 
people don't plan early enough for what's coming later.  
23 
So if you know who needs to be deposed, you can start 
24 
talking about it.  You can open your calendars, you can 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 63 of 67

1                       
PROCEEDINGS 
64 
start talking about availability of witnesses.  You can 
2 
sketch out a plan how you're going to get these things 
3 
done by June 10.   
4 
So it sounds like May will be a month when 
5 
you'll be involved in depositions.  Figure out sooner 
6 
rather than later what witnesses' availability would be 
7 
for May.  With respect to someone like a 30(b)(6) witness 
8 
where it may make sense to have one deposition attended by 
9 
multiple counsel, talk about that sort of thing.  That 
10 
won't be a one-day deposition; you've got too many lawyers 
11 
who want to ask questions.  How many days it should be, 
12 
how that should be structured, talk about it; see if you 
13 
can come up with a plan, reserve some time for it.  But if 
14 
you wait until the end of April to start talking about how 
15 
you're going to conduct depositions in May, you're going 
16 
to find oh, this person's not available or this other 
17 
person has some commitment or whatever.   
18 
So the sooner you can block out time, come up 
19 
with, you know, a general plan of how this is all going to 
20 
happen, the better, because otherwise, I'll be hearing at 
21 
the end of May, "We have two weeks left on our schedule, 
22 
and we don't have dates yet for depositions."  And that's 
23 
-- (indiscernible) litigation, try to avoid it by advanced 
24 
planning.  If any depositions involve travel, figure it 
25 
Case 1:19-cv-07625-AJN-DCF     Document 56     Filed 02/13/20     Page 64 of 67

PROCEEDINGS 
65 
out sooner rather than later.  Try to make the plans ahead 
2 
of time.  If there are witnesses who are going to take the 
3 
Fifth, try to find that out; try to, you know, identify 
4 
who you're talking about.  Try to find out on your side if 
5 
that's going to happen, let plaintiffs' counsel know.  It 
6 
will affect the planning, it will affect overall 
7 
scheduling.  You know, everybody's schedules will benefit 
8 
from that kind of communication.  All right?  The most 
9 
effective litigation in terms of efficiency are the ones 
10 
where the lawyers, you know, sit down, open their 
11 
calendars -- old-fashioned? -- you know, smartphones, 
12 
whatever they are, and try to figure it out.  All right?  
13 
Especially if you want to coordinate any depositions.  
14 
Right?  You've got a lot of people; start talking about it 
15 
sooner rather than later.  All right? 
16 
Okay.  Anybody have anything else for me?  Are 
17 
there any other cases where I should diverge from this 
18 
schedule in any way?  Probably not, right? 
19 
MR. EDWARDS:  No, your Honor. 
20 
THE COURT:  All right, I will issue -- 
21 
MS. WANG:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  I don't have 
22 
anything on the schedules.  I just wanted to flag that 
23 
there was one set of briefing around which we jointly 
24 
submitted a briefing schedule and your Honor just said 
25

that you had wanted an update on settlement discussions 
2 
before entering that order.  So I can just point out that 
3 
it's -- 
4 
THE COURT:  That's fine.  I know what that is. 
5 
MS. WANG:  It's in the Davies case. 
6 
THE COURT:  That's fine.  Even though I said I 
7 
was -- I might well set different schedules in each case, 
8 
I don't really see the need to do that.  So you're on the 
9 
same track.  You know, it may happen that, you know, one 
10 
or two of them or three or four of them end up on a 
11 
different schedule as we go, but for now let's keep them 
12 
where they are.  And hopefully, all of that good-faith 
13 
conference you're going to have about discovery will help 
14 
keep you moving along.  If not, you know where I am.  All 
15 
right? 
16 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you. 
17 
THE COURT:  Thank you, all.  Good luck with the 
18 
settlement fund concept.  I'm rooting for you.
