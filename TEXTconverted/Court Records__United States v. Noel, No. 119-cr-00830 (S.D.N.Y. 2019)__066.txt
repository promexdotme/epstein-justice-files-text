Re: 
US v. Tova Noel, et al 
 
 
Docket # 19 cr. 830 (AT) 
 
 
Order to Release Firearm and any other Property 
 
Dear Judge Torres: 
 
On January 3, 2022, the Court filed the fully executed Nolle Prosequi Order formally 
terminating the prosecution and dismissing all criminal charges in the above 
referenced criminal action.  In November of 2019, Ms. Tova Noel was released with 
conditions.  One of the conditions required the surrender of her firearm to the New 
York City Police Department (NYPD).  As required, Ms. Noel promptly surrendered 
her firearm to the 44th Precinct of the NYPD in the Bronx. 
 
On January 4, 2022, Ms. Noel went to the 44th Precinct to retrieve her firearm with 
a copy of the Nolle Prosequi Order.  She was referred to the NYPD property clerk’s 
office located in the basement of the Bronx Criminal Court.  The NYPD property clerk 
was presented with the Nolle Prosequi Order, however, the property clerk refused to 
release the firearm.  The NYPD property clerk indicated that they would only release 
the firearm pursuant to a court order. 
 
Attached is a proposed order mandating the release of Ms. Noel’s firearm and any 
other property that was surrendered as a condition of release.  I have spoken with 
the Government regarding this application, and they have no objection.  Thank you 
for your thoughtful consideration. 
 
Sincerely,
