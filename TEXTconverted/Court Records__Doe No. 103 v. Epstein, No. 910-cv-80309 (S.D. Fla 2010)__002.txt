UNOPPOSED MOTION TO SEAL AND PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 103, by and through her undersigned counsel and pursuant to Rule 
5 .4 S. D .Fla.LR., moves this Court to enter an Order granting Plaintiff permission to file her identity 
under seal and to proceed in this action under the pseudonym "Jane Doe No. 103" and, as grounds, 
states as follows: 
1. 
As outlined in detail in the Complaint, Jane Doe No. 103 was sexually abused by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, when she was under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a result of Defendant's sexual abuse, Plaintiff has in the past suffered, and will 
in the future suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and/or 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss of educational 
opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy, and other damages 
associated with Defendant's manipulating and leading her into a perverse and unhealthy way oflife 
for a minor.

CASE NO. 
3. 
Disclosure of Plaintiff's name would cause her much additional embarrassment, 
humiliation, and psychological trauma. 
4. 
The subject matter of the Complaint clearly contains highly sensitive and intimate 
information about Plaintiff. 
5. 
Plaintiff was an identified victim by the State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office in their criminal investigations against 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. 
6. 
During the related criminal investigations, and up and to this point in time, Plaintiff's 
identity has been sealed, as all parties recognize the highly sensitive subject matter of the charges 
and the need to protect the privacy interest of Plaintiff's identity. 
7. 
In this civil action, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, already knows Plaintiff's identity and 
will be privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiff's name. Therefore, he knows the identity 
of Plaintiff and will not be prejudiced by public non-disclosure of Jane Doe No. 103 's identity. 
8. 
There is great need, in this case, to protect intimate information about Plaintiff, Jane 
Doe No. 103, and to protect her privacy interest. 
Memorandum of Law 
The general presumption against anonymous or pseudonymous pleadings, is commonly 
overcome in certain types of cases, and courts have discretion to permit such pleading in appropriate 
circumstances. "[P]rivacy or confidentiality concerns are sometimes sufficiently critical that parties 
or witnesses should be allowed this rare dispensation." James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233,238 ( 4th Cir. 
1993 ). As is ordinarily the case where trial courts have discretion, judicial guidelines exist for the

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 2   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/09/2010   Page 3 of 7
CASE NO. 
exercise of such discretion in the form of factors that courts should consider in deciding whether to 
grant anonymity requests. They are not many, for the question happily is one that is seldom raised. 
Nevertheless, some guidelines can be gleaned from the relatively few cases-both at the trial and 
appellate levels-that have wrestled with the problem. Among them are the following that have 
relevance to this case: whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid 
the annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or to preserve privacy in a matter of 
sensitive and highly personal nature; whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or 
mental harm to the requesting party or, even more critically, to innocent non-parties; the ages of the 
persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected; and, relatedly, the risk of unfairness to 
the opposing party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously. See id. (internal 
citations omitted). 
In deciding whether to permit pseudonymous pleadings, courts must balance "the plaintiff's 
right to privacy and security against the dual concerns of (1) public interest in identification of 
litigants and (2) harm to the defendant stemming from [suppression] of plaintiff's name." Doe v. 
Smith, 105 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (internal citation omitted). The ultimate test for 
permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the plaintiff has a substantial privacy right 
that outweighs the customary presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. See Doe v. Stegall, 
653 F.2d 180, 185-86 (5th Cir., 1981). Courts typically accept pseudonym filing in cases where the 
nature of the pleading unveils highly sensitive information and detail about the plaintiff, such that 
the non-disclosure of the party's name is necessary to protect her from harassment, injury, ridicule, 
or personal embarrassment. See United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920, 922 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981); see

also Doe v. Smith, 429 F.3d 706 (7th Cir. 2005) (court required to consider whether the interests of 
justice required adult woman, who was videotaped having consensual sex with her boyfriend when 
she was a minor, to disclose her name as plaintiff in lawsuit against boyfriend alleging that boyfriend 
illegally distributed videotape); Does IThruXXJJiv. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-
68 (9th Cir. 2000) ( district court abused its discretion in denying permission to proceed anonymously 
to Chinese employees working in garment industry in Mariana Islands where employees were 
vulnerable to retaliation); Stegall, 653 F .2d at 185-86 ( anonymity warranted to protect minor 
plaintiffs against risk of violence from revelation of unpopular personal beliefs); Doe v. United 
Servs. Life Ins. Co., 123 F.R.D. 437 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (anonymity allowed because of sensitive 
privacy and retaliation concerns in suit by homosexual against insurance company alleging 
discriminatory practices; no unfairness to defendant, who was aware of claimant's identity); Candy 
H v. Redemption Ranch, 563 F. Supp. 505 (M.D. Ala. 1983) (anonymity allowed in suit by pregnant 
19-year-old alleging fraudulent inducement to enter defendant's Home for Girls). 
It is clear from the allegations of sexual abuse of a minor in the Complaint that the 
information is of a highly sensitive nature. Jane Doe No. 103 's name remained anonymous in the 
related criminal cases, and Defendant's attorneys, the State Attorney's Office, as well as the United 
States government, redacted all documents containing her name. The present case is not one in 
which permitting Plaintiffs identity to be kept under seal and allowing her to proceed anonymously 
will disadvantage Defendant in any way. Defendant already knows Plaintiffs identity and will be 
privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiffs name. While the public normally has a right to 
the openness of judicial proceedings, the victim's privacy interest greatly outweighs the right to

know the identity of a victim of child sex abuse. Other than the identity of Plaintiff, the aspects of 
this case will be available to the public. Evidently, the balance weighs overwhelmingly in favor 
sealing Plaintiffs identity and allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously. 
This Court recently has allowed at least 15 other plaintiffs who were underage sex abuse 
victims ofDefendant, Jeffrey Epstein, to proceed anonymously, including the following: See C.M.A. 
v. Epstein et al., Case No. 9:08-cv-80811-KAM; Jane Doe No. 1 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-cv-
80069-KAM (Dismissed); Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, Case No.9:08-cv-80119-KAM; Jane Doe No.

9:08-cv-80994-KAM; Jane Doe No. 7 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-cv-80993-KAM; Jane Doe v. 
Epstein, Case No. 9:08-cv-80893-KAM; Jane Doe v. Epstein et al., Case No. 9:08-cv-80804-KAM

No. 9:09-cv-80591-KAM (Closed); Jane Doe No. 102 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:09-cv-80656-KAM 
(Closed); Jane Doe No. 8 vs. Epstein, Case No. 9:09-cv-80802-KAM; L.M. vs Epstein, Case No. 
9:09-cv-81092-KAM. Accordingly, this Court should likewise permit Jane Doe No. 103 to proceed 
anonymously.
