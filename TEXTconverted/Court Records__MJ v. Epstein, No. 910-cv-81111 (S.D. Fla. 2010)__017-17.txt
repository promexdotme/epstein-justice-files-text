UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 08-CIV- 80893 -MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE, 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendants. 
____________ __:! 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR LEAVE/PROTECTIVE ORDER TO REDACT PORTIONS 
OF TAX RECORDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAST PORTION OF DE 572 AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, moves for the entry of an order, protective order or modification of the order 
under DE 572 allowing for the redaction of certain tax records, or that the records are for 
"Attorneys or Experts' Eyes Only," and states: 
I. 
On February 4, 2010, this Court entered an order (DE 462) requiring that Epstein 
produce his tax returns, passport and certain information provided to him by the federal 
government during certain criminal proceedings. 
2. 
After Motions for Reconsideration and Rule 4 Appeal/Responses were fully 
briefed, this court entered its order at DE 572 requiring that Jeffrey Epstein produce his tax 
returns, his passport and the information the federal government gave to Epstein's lawyers 
during said criminal proceedings. See DEs 462 and 572. The Order requires that Epstein, 

Case 9:08-cv-80893-KAM   Document 182    Entered on FLSD Docket 06/30/2010   Page 2 of 6
Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 17-17   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 2 of 6
through his couusel, comply within 3 days (i.e., by Juue 30, 2010). As such, this motion must be 
timely addressed. 
3. 
As part of that order at DE 572, this court ruled that" ... Plaintiff shall not disclose 
Defendant's tax returns to any third parties without Defendant's consent and/or further court 
order. .. [ and] Plaintiff may disclose this information to an expert witness retained to testify at 
trial, but only on condition that the expert will agree to retain the confidentiality of the 
information and not disclose it to any third parties without the agreement of defendant or further 
order of the Court." The order went on to state that it " .. .is without prejudice to any future 
motion by defendant to exclude any of the information produced pursuant to this order at trial." 
4. 
Plaintiff's counsel here, and in other cases, has always been quick to respond to 
media inquiries. The court has directed that the tax returns themselves remain confidential. 
Defendant expects that the information contained therein will be afforded that same protection. 
However, if Plaintiff's couusel provides information (such as the identification and sources of 
Defendant's income) to others (i.e., non-lawyers, investigators, etc ... ), they will use that 
information in an improper manner and in violation of the court's order. As set forth in DE 569, 
Mr. Edwards admittedly has provided the journal and/or book secured from Alfredo Rodriguez 
to his investigators "who are now following-up [alleged] significant discovery leads found in the 
book." 
5. 
Therefore, Epstein, in good faith, moves this court for an order allowing him to 
redact certain information or designate the documents produced "Attorneys and Experts' Eyes 
Only." 
6. 
While the tax returns in this case are to be maintained as confidential, certain 
information should be redacted in those tax returns including, but not limited to, the names of the 
2

companies, trusts, properties and other investment vehicles EPSTEIN has invested in over the 
years. This information is personal, confidential and trade secret information. The commercially 
sensitive and trade secret information contained in the tax returns could result in irreparable harm 
to Epstein if disseminated, and thus should be protected. Lynch v. Silcox, 2001 WL 1200656 
(S.D. Fla. 2001); Saye v. Old Hill Partners, Inc., 478 F.Supp. 248, 274-276 (D.Ct. Conn. 
2007)(question of fact existed as to whether investment company's business formula, which 
included investment trading strategy, investor lists, portfolios, financing methods ... was trade-
secret); see also U.S. v. Baez-Alcaino, 718 F. Supp. 1503, 1505-06 (M.D. Fla. 1989) (affirming 
lower court's decision to file redacted plea agreements to serve compelling government 
interests); In re Duque, 134 B.R. 679, 687 (S.D. Fla. 1991) (finding that court's procedure 
requiring attorneys to provide privileged documents to court for in-camera inspection while 
providing redacted versions to the bankruptcy trustee was proper). 
7. 
No figures or income information in the tax returns will be redacted. 
8. 
Moreover, the right to privacy encompasses at least two different kinds of 
interests, the individual interests of disclosing personal matters and the interest in independence 
in making certain kinds of important decisions. Favalora v. Sidaway, 966 So.2d 895 (Fla. 4th 
DCA 2008). Likewise, Article I, s. 23, Right of Privacy, provides that every natural person has 
the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person's private life. 
Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S. 367, 387 (1986); State v. Jardines, 9 So.3d I (Fla. 3d DCA 
2008)(the Fourth Amendment clearly protects the right of people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers and effects from intrusion). 
9. 
While the scope of discovery is broad, it is not without limits. Washington v. 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th Cir. 1992). Courts have long held 
3 

Case 9:08-cv-80893-KAM   Document 182    Entered on FLSD Docket 06/30/2010   Page 4 of 6
Case 9:10-cv-81111-WPD   Document 17-17   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2010   Page 4 of 6
that while the standard of relevancy in discovery is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a 
party to roam in the shadow zones of relevancy and to explore matters which does not presently 
appear germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so. Food Lion, Inc. v. United 
Food & Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) (string 
cite omitted). See also Capco Properties, LLC v. Monterry Gardens of Pinecrest Condo., 982 So. 
2d 1211, (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding that discovery in civil cases must be relevant to the 
subject matter of the case and must be admissible or reasonably calculated to lead to admissible 
evidence); Morton Plant Hospital Ass'n, Inc. v. Shahbas, 960 So. 2d 820, 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 
2007) (holding that "discovery should be denied when it has been established that the 
information requested is neither relevant to any pending claim or defense nor will it lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence," citing Tanchel v. Shoemaker, 928 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 5th 
DCA 2006)). 
10. 
At this juncture, and in an effort to comply with the above order, Epstein is 
producing the redacted versions of the tax returns until further order from the court. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, requests the Court enter an order 
and/or protective order allowing Epstein to redact the above information and grant any additional 
relief the Court deems just and proper. 
Local Rule 7.1 Statement 
Pursuant to the above rule, the undersigned counsel and Plaintiffs counsel have
