UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA  
 
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
 
JANE DOE, a/k/a 
JANE DOE #1, 
  
 
Plaintiff, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vs. 
 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY ROBSON, 
and SARAH KELLEN, 
 
 
Defendants. 
_________________________________/ 
 
EPSTEIN’S RESPONSE TO 
MOTION TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE [DE 12] 
 
 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein hereby responds to the plaintiff Jane Doe’s motion to preserve 
evidence, as follows:   
1. 
The Certificate of Compliance annexed to the plaintiff’s motion states that 
plaintiff’s “counsel conferred with counsel for [Mr. Epstein] . . . and [Epstein’s] counsel advised 
that [Epstein] oppose[s] this motion.”  DE 12 at 2 (emphasis added).  That certification is 
inaccurate.   
2. 
On August 21, 2008, counsel for the plaintiff called Kathryn Meyers, Esq. of the 
Lewis Tein law firm to elicit Epstein’s position on this motion.  Ms. Meyers responded that she 
would confer with Mr. Tein and call them back.  Less than thirty minutes later, however, 
plaintiff’s counsel - - without waiting to hear back from us - - electronically filed the motion, 
incorrectly certifying that we had actually opposed it.   
3. 
Upon receipt of the motion via CM/ECF, Ms. Meyers immediately notified 
plaintiff’s counsel of their error.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not notify the court of the incorrect

certification, leaving the Court with the impression that Epstein opposed the motion and perhaps 
prompting the Court to order an expedited response. 
4. 
In fact, Epstein has no opposition to the relief requested.   
5. 
It is worth noting that the motion for return of property filed in the State criminal 
matter has not been noticed for a hearing, has not been argued or ruled upon, and no property has 
been returned.    
Respectfully submitted,
