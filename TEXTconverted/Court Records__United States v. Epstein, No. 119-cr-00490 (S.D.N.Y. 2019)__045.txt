August 12, 2019 
Thank you for your letter of Augu~t l 0, 2019 rcgarcHng the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. 
Epstein's death iis a tragedy to everyone involved in his case. 
One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your 1.etter 
will include th~ incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23,2019., To my 
knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP concluded abo\lt that incident.
