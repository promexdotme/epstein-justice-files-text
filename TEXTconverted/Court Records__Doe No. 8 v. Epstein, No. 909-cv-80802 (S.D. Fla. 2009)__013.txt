JEFFREY EPSTEIN,

____________________________________/ 
 
PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 8’s MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN  
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT 
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 8, submits this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion to 
Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint, pursuant to S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1(C), as follows:  
INTRODUCTION 
 
As with the related cases in this Court against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, Plaintiff Jane Doe 
No. 8 alleges that she was the victim of a plan and scheme by Defendant Epstein to lure her to his 
Palm Beach mansion, where he sexually molested her.  The Complaint in this case sets forth state 
law claims and a federal law claim under 18 U.S.C. §§2422 and 2255.  Defendant relies exclusively 
on the statute of limitations as grounds for dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).   
 
With respect to Plaintiff’s state law causes of action for assault and battery, Defendant 
incorrectly applies a four-year statute of limitations.  Florida Statute §95.11 is clear that a seven-year 
statute of limitations applies to the state law claims alleged by Plaintiff.  As a result, the state law 
cause of action for assault and battery is timely.   
 
In contending that Plaintiff’s federal claim should be dismissed based on the statute of 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 1 of 10

limitations, Defendant wrongly assumes that this claim accrued on the date when Defendant’s 
wrongful conduct occurred.  Defendant’s argument fails to recognize that the “discovery rule” is 
applicable, which provides that an action does not accrue until the Plaintiff knew or should have 
known of both her injuries and their cause.  Given the nature of the discovery rule and the factual 
inquiry it necessitates in the context of childhood sexual abuse, Plaintiff’s federal claim is not 
susceptible to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss should be denied in its entirety.  
ARGUMENT 
I. 
DISMISSAL IS NOT WARRANTED UNDER  
 
FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6) AS TO ANY OF PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS 
 
Defendant moves for dismissal of Counts I and III of the Complaint exclusively on grounds 
of statute of limitations, which is an affirmative defense.  Such a dismissal “is appropriate only if its 
is apparent from the face of the complaint that the claim is time barred.”  Tello v Dean Witter 
Reynolds, Inc., 410 F.3d 1275, 1288 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).  “This standard for dismissal 
can be met only if the complaint shows the date on which the time-barred claim accrued.”  Durden v. 
Citicorp Trust Bank, 2008 WL 2098040 *3 (M.D.Fla. 2008) (citing Avco Corp. v. Precision Air 
Parts, Inc., 676 F.2d 494, 495-96 (11th Cir. 1982)) (emphasis supplied).  Accord Del Monte Fresh 
Produce Co. v. Dole Food Co., 136 F.Supp. 2d 1271, 1294 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (Gold, J.) (“[t]he 
absence of an indication of the date on which Del Monte discovered the alleged misappropriations 
prevents the Court from determining from the face of the complaint at what time Del Monte’s 
actions accrued.”).  It is not apparent  from the Complaint in this case that any of Plaintiff’s claims 
are time barred.   In particular, nowhere does the Complaint allege the date on which any of her 
claims accrued.  Therefore, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied in its entirety.

II. 
COUNT I OF COMPLAINT IS NOT TIME BARRED UNDER THE 
 
SEVEN-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, FLA. STAT. §95.11(7) 
 
 
Count I (assault and battery) and Count II (intentional infliction of emotional distress) allege 
claims under state law. 1
The Complaint in this case alleges “abuse” under the broad definition of §39.01.  Specifically, Count 
I alleges willful acts (Complaint ¶¶ 8-13, 18-19); resulting in physical, mental or sexual injury 
(Complaint ¶¶ 13,17); that cause or are likely to cause the child’s physical, mental or emotional 
   Defendant asserts that Count I should be dismissed because a four-year 
statute of limitations applies to that claim, and it is apparent from the face of the Complaint that 
Plaintiff filed her claim past this limitations period.   Defendant recognizes that, for this argument to 
succeed, he must establish that Fla.Stat. §95.11(7), providing a seven-year limitations period after the 
Plaintiff reaches the age of majority for claims based on abuse, is inapplicable in this case.  A review 
of the language of the Statute, however, and applying basic tenets of statutory construction, reveal 
that §95.11(7) is clearly the statute of limitations pertinent to Plaintiff’s state law claims.   
 
Section 95.11(7) provides a seven-year limitations period, as follows:  
(7) For intentional torts based on abuse. – An action founded on 
alleged abuse, as defined in s. 39.01, . . . may be commenced at any 
time within 7 years after the age of majority, or within 4 years after 
the injured person leaves the dependency of the abuser, or within 4 
years from the time of discovery by the injured party of both the 
injury and the causal relationship between the injury and the abuse, 
whichever occurs later.  
 
The term “abuse” is defined in Fla.Stat. §39.01(2) as follows:  
“Abuse” means any willful act or threatened act that results in any 
physical, mental or sexual injury or harm that causes or is likely to 
cause the child’s physical, mental, or emotional health to be 
significantly impaired.  
 
                                                 
1 Defendant did not move for dismissal of Count II. 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 3 of 10

 
 
- 4 - 
health to be significantly impaired (Complaint ¶¶ 14, 20).  Under §95.11(7), therefore, the Plaintiff 
has until seven years after she reaches the age of majority to bring suit (i.e. until she is 25 years old), 
or within four years from the time she discovers both the injury and the causal relationship between 
the injury and abuse, whichever occurs later.  Accordingly, the statute of limitations cannot expire 
before the Plaintiff’s 25th birthday, and her Count I claim is timely under §95.11(7). 
 
Defendant nonetheless asserts that the pertinent limitations provision is §95.11(3)(o), 
providing a four-year limitation period, not §95.11(7).  Section 95.11(3)(o), lists causes of action 
subject to a four-year limitations period, as follows:  
An action for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, 
malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional 
tort, except as provided in subsections (4), (5), and (7). 
 
(Emphasis supplied).  Section 95.11(3)(o), by its express terms, is subject to an exception, as 
provided in § 95.11(7).  The plain meaning of this language is that an intentional tort claim alleging 
“abuse” against a child, as described in Fla.Stat. §39.01, is controlled by §95.11(7), which trumps 
§95.11(3)(o).  The seven-year limitations period (or four years after discovery) thus applies in this 
case.  See H.T.E. v. Tyler Technologies, Inc., 217 F.Supp. 2d 1255, 1259 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (where 
language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given its plain and obvious 
meaning).  
 
Defendant nonetheless seems to argue that §95.11(3)(o) applies because it expressly 
references the intentional torts of assault and battery, ignoring that the Complaint at issue alleges 
“abuse” as defined in Florida Statute §§95.11(7) and 39.01(2).  This is a strained and plainly 
incorrect construction of the language in §§95.11(3)(o) and 95.11(7).  Defendant essentially contends 
that only a claim of “abuse” would be controlled by §95.11(7), while other intentional torts would

necessarily fall under §95.11(3)(o).  However, as one Court has recognized, there is no Florida cause 
of action for abuse, and §95.11(7) did not create one.  Zlotogura v. Geller, 681 So.2d 778 (Fla. 3d 
DCA 1996).  Accordingly, if §95.11(7) is to have any meaning, it necessarily must encompass claims 
of assault and battery and other intentional torts involving “abuse” upon a child as defined in 
§39.01(2).  
 
Even assuming that §§95.11(3)(o) and 95.11(7) were ambiguous, it is a basic rule of statutory 
construction that two sections are to be read in para materia, such that all sections are given effect 
and are read as a consistent whole.  H.T.E., 217 F.Supp. 2d at 1259.  Doing so in this case compels 
the conclusion that the seven-year limitation of §95.11(7) applies to Plaintiff’s Count I claim.  
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count I must accordingly be denied.  
III. 
THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT SHOW ON ITS FACE  
 
THAT PLAINTIFF’S COUNT III CLAIM IS TIME BARRED 
 
Count III of the Complaint alleges a claim of coercion and enticement to sexual activity 
against a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422.  A victim who suffers personal injuries as a result of 
a violation of this statutory provision is granted a private right of action under 18 U.S.C. §2255.  A 
limitations provision is included on this statute at subsection (b), which provides that a claim is 
barred unless it is brought “within six years after the rights of action first accrues or in the case of a 
person under a legal disability, not later than three years after disability.”2
                                                 
2 Under Florida law, a person is under a disability as a minor until age 18.  See Fla. Stat. §743.07. 
 
 
  The pertinent issue, then, 
for purposes of this statute of limitations, where the victim is over the age of 21, is when the action 
accrued.  Defendant Epstein assumes in his Motion to Dismiss that the action accrued on the date 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 5 of 10

 
 
- 6 - 
when Epstein’s sexual misconduct occurred.3
 
A claim does not necessarily accrue when the wrongful conduct occurs.  Rather, the 
“discovery rule” applies to accrual of federal causes of action.  See White v. Mercury Marine, 129 
F.3d 1428, 1435 (11th Cir. 1997) (noting that use of word “accrue” indicated approval of discovery 
rule in statute of limitations in accordance with federal precedents adopting discovery rule).  Under 
this rule, an action accrues “when the plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury and its 
cause.”
  That assumption is incorrect under federal law and the 
allegations of the Complaint.  
4
                                                 
3 The Motion to Dismiss asserts that “it has been at least 8 years since the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN, well past the six year statute of limitations, thus requiring dismissal of Count III.”  
(Motion to Dismiss, p. 4).  
 
4 The case of Smith v. Husband, 376 F.Supp. 2d 603 (E.D.Va. 2005) is inapposite.  While that case 
was brought under 18 U.S.C. §2255 for a violation of 18 U.S.C. §2251, alleging sexual exploitation 
of a minor for the purpose of producing a sexually explicit videotape, the plaintiff did not argue the 
discovery rule.  Rather, the plaintiff contended that the continuing violation rule applied to toll the 
statute of limitations, which the Court rejected.  As a result, the Court never considered application 
of the discovery rule.  
 
  Id. (emphasis supplied).  See also Lavellee v. Listi, 611 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir. 1980) (in 
a case analyzing accrual under federal law for a civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983, noting 
that the Supreme Court in United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 100 S.Ct. 352 (1979), “has 
rejected the standard which would allow the statute of limitations to commence running before the 
plaintiff was or should have been aware of the causal connection between his injury and the acts of 
defendants”) (emphasis supplied).  Accord Diaz v. United States, 165 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir. 
1999) (in wrongful death case under Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), holding that claim accrues 
when the plaintiff knows or should have known both of the decedent’s death and its causal 
connection to the government); Stoleson v. United States, 629 F.2d 1265, 1270-71(7th Cir. 1980) 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 6 of 10

 
 
- 7 - 
(holding that claim under FTCA did not accrue until the plaintiff had knowledge of a causal 
connection “to tie together” the breach of duty and her injury); Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64, 
76-83 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 903 (2004) (holding that discovery rule, requiring that 
accrual does not occur before the plaintiff knew or should have known of injury and its causal 
connection to the defendant, applies outside the medical malpractice context).  
 
In  a case where a minor is sexually abused, or wrongfully enticed or coerced into sexual 
activity by an adult, the victim is unlikely in the exercise of reasonable diligence to be (i) 
immediately aware of her injuries given the subtle and pernicious effects of childhood sexual abuse; 
or (ii) able to connect those injuries to the defendant’s misconduct.  See Doe v. Paukstat, 863 
F.Supp. 884, 890-91 (E.D. Wis. 1994) (noting that application of discovery rule in case of childhood 
sexual abuse is “amorphous”, and holding that when cause of action for abuse accrues is a question 
for the trier-of-fact); cf. R.L. v. Voytac, 971 A.2d 1074 (N.J. 2009) (holding that “it is necessary to 
consider all relevant facts and circumstances”, including expert psychological testimony, in applying 
discovery rule to claim of childhood sexual abuse, and that the issue is “when the injured party in 
fact discovered, or when a reasonable person subjected to child sexual abuse should have discovered, 
that the claimed injury was causally related to the asserted child abuse by the defendant”).  The 
determination of when the limitations period accrues under the discovery rule, in a case involving the 
defendant’s sexual misconduct with a minor, therefore, requires a detailed and complex factual 
inquiry.  The date of accrual certainly is not obvious nor is it otherwise alleged in the Plaintiff’s 
Complaint.5
                                                 
5 As discussed in §I above, dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on statute of limitations grounds is 
only appropriate when the date of accrual is alleged in the complaint itself.  
 
   As a result, Count III cannot be dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on the basis of

6 It would also be inappropriate to dismiss this case on limitations grounds because Defendant has 
argued in one of the related cases that 18 U.S.C. §2255 requires a prior federal conviction.  (See Jane 
Doe 101 v. Epstein, case no. 09-CV-80591, Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint, p. 15, 
§II(A), DE 29).  If that argument were correct then the Plaintiff’s claim in Count III has not yet 
accrued.  Defendant should not be heard to whipsaw the Plaintiffs and take such inconsistent 
positions in these related cases.
