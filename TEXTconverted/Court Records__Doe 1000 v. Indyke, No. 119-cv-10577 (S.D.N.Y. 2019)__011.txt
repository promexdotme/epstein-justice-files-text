Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses of Serving a Summons 
Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons 
and complaint. A defendant who is located in the United States and who fails to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in 
the United States will be required to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the fa ilure. 
"Good cause" does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the cou11 has 
no jurisdiction over th is matter or over the defendant or the defendant's property. 
If the waiver is signed and returned, you can sti ll make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of 
a summons or of service. 
If you waive service, then you must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff 
and file a copy with the court. By signing and returning the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.
