PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102’s  MOTION FOR 
LEAVE TO FILE UNDER SEAL RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO 
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO UNSEAL 
THE NONPROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
 
 
 
Pursuant to Rule 5.4 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida, Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (together, 
the “Plaintiffs”) by and through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this Motion For 
Leave to File Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102’s Response in 
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time Certain 
Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated Memorandum of 
Law Under Seal, and, as grounds, state as follows: 
1. 
Undersigned counsel seek to file this Response in Opposition to Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion to Stay under seal in order to abide by this Court’s August 21, 
2008 Order to Compel Production and Protective Order entered in Case No. 08-80736-
CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON (the “Protective Order”).  The Protective Order prohibits 
Plaintiffs from disclosing the Non-Prosecution Agreement (the “NPA”) or its terms to 
any third party.   The sealed document should be maintained under seal for the duration 
of this Court’s August 21, 2008 Protective Order.   
Case 9:09-cv-80591-KAM   Document 37   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 4 of 10

5/29/2009 
4:41:55 PM 
2. 
Undersigned counsel recognize that this Court has previously unsealed 
documents referring to the NPA.  We seek to comply with the Protective Order for this 
new and independent filing in an abundance of caution, until directed otherwise by the 
Court.   
3. 
If this Court denies Plaintiffs’ instant motion, Plaintiffs seek appropriate 
disclosure of the NPA pursuant to this Court’s recent order in Case No. 08-80736-CIV-
MARRA/JOHNSON (DE #36) denying Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2’s 
motion to unseal the NPA.  As stated in that Order, the NPA has not been filed with the 
Court.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 would then have “a specific 
tangible need to be relieved of the restrictions” of the Protective Order because 
consideration of the terms of the NPA is necessary for this Court to resolve Defendant’s 
Motion to Stay.   
 
WHEREFORE,  
1. 
Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to enter an Order granting 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 the right to file under seal their 
Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time 
Certain Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated 
Memorandum of Law.   
2. 
In the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to unseal the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement in order to allow Plaintiffs to concretely respond to 
Defendant’s Motion to Stay.    
3. 
Finally, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to grant such other and 
further relief to which this Court finds the Plaintiff otherwise entitled.
