DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR LEA VE TO FILE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE UNDER SEAL 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby respectfully moves 
this Honorable Court for leave to file under seal his supplemental financial disclosure. As noted in 
Mr. Epstein's bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial 
disclosure. Counsel's advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the infmmation provided to the Comt. Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his 
fmthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal. As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein relies 
on the exceptional amount of publicity that has been generated by this case, much of which relates 
specifically to his finances. Under the Bail Ref01111 Act, financial information provided by a 
defendant to a pretrial services officer "shall be used only for the purposes of a bail determination 
and shall othe1wise be confidential." 18 U.S.C. § 3153( c)(l ). Here, in the event Mr. Epstein is 
required to publicly file his financial statement, the information contained therein will inevitably be 
widely disseminated in the news media, contrnvening the statutmy requirement of confidentiality.
