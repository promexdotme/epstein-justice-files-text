STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
Upon information and belief, the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, has 
demonstrated a sexual preference and obsession for minor girls. 
9. 
The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, developed a plan, scheme, and criminal 
enterprise that included an elaborate system wherein the then-minor L.M. was brought 
to the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's residence by the Defendant's employees, recruiters, 
and assistants. When the assistants and employees left the then-minor L.M. (and, on 
some occasions, other minor girls) alone in a room at the Defendant's mansion, the 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, himself would appear, remove his clothing, and direct the 
then-minor L.M. to remove her clothing. 
He would then perform one or more lewd, 
lascivious, and sexual acts, including, but not limited to, masturbation, touching of the 
then minor Plaintiffs sexual organs, coercing or forcing the then-minor L.M. to perform 
oral sex on him, using vibrators or sexual toys on the then-minor L.M., coercing the

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 3 of 82
then-minor L.M. into sexual acts with himself or others, and digitally penetrating the 
then-minor L.M .. He would then pay L.M. for engaging in this sexual activity. 
10. 
L.M. was first brought to the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's mansion in 2002 
when she was a fourteen-year old in middle school. 
11. 
The then-minor L.M. was a vulnerable child without adequate parental 
support at all times material to this Complaint. 
The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, a 
wealthy financier with a lavish home, significant wealth, and a network of assistants and 
employees, used his resources and his influence over a vulnerable minor child to 
engage in a systematic pattern of sexually exploitive behavior. 
12. Beginning in approximately August 2002 and continuing until approximately 
the end of October 2005, the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, repeatedly coerced, induced 
and/or enticed the impressionable, vulnerable, and economically deprived then-minor 
L.M. to commit various acts of sexual misconduct and sexually abused L.M. These acts 
included, but were not limited to, fondling and inappropriate and illegal sexual touching 
of the then-minor L.M., forcing the then-minor L.M. into oral sex, sexual misconduct and 
masturbation of the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, in the presence of the then-minor L.M., 
handling and fondling of the then-minor L.M.'s sexual organs for the purpose of 
masturbation, and encouraging the then-minor L.M. to become involved in prostitution; 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, committed, and conspired with others to commit, numerous 
criminal sexual offenses against the then minor Plaintiff including, but not limited to, 
sexual battery, solicitation of prostitution, coercing a minor into a life of prostitution, and 
lewd and lascivious assaults upon the person of the then-minor L.M. Defendant Jeffrey

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 4 of 82
Epstein knowingly transported L.M. and other minors in interstate commerce with the 
intent that the L.M. engage in prostitution and in other sexual activity for which he and 
others could be charged with criminal offenses. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein also 
knowingly used means of interstate commerce to knowing persuade and induce minors, 
including L.M., to engage in prostitution and other sexual activity for which he and 
others could be charged with criminal offenses. 
13. 
In addition to the direct sexual abuse and molestation of the then-minor 
L.M., Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, instructed, coerced and otherwise induced the then-
minor L.M. to bring him numerous other minor girls (some as young at 12 years old) for 
the purposes of further satisfying his deviant sexual attraction to minors and for 
purposes of prostitution. On information and belief, Epstein sexually abused hundreds 
of minor girls through his recruiting system. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, used his 
money, wealth and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then-
minor L.M. to bring him these other minor girls for purposes of prostitution and in 
exchange for money. This influence led the then-minor L.M. away from the life of a 
middle school aged child and into a delinquent lifestyle. This conduct also involved 
transporting L.M .. and other minors in interstate commerce and using means of 
interstate commerce, to persuade and induce L.M. and others to engage in prostitution 
and in other sexual activity for which he and others could be charged with criminal 
offenses. 
14. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, at all times material to this Complaint, knew 
and should have known of L.M.'s minority. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, at all times

material to this Complaint, knew and should have know of the minority of the other girls 
he was sexually abusing 
15. 
The acts referenced above in paragraphs 10 through 14, committed by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, against the then-minor Plaintiff L.M. were committed in 
violation of numerous State criminal statutes condemning the sexual exploitation of 
minor children, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses, sexual performances by a 
child, lewd and lascivious assaults, sexual battery, contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those criminal offenses 
outlined in Chapters 794, 800, 827 and 84 7 of the Florida Statutes, as well as those 
designated in Florida Statutes §796.03, §796.07, §796.045, §796.04, §796.09, §39.01, 
and §827.04. 
16. 
The acts reference above in paragraphs 10 through 15, committed by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, against the then-Minor Plaintiff L.M. were committed in 
violation of numerous federal criminal statutes condemning the coercion and 
enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to 
engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor 
children, child exploitation enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not 
limited to, those crimes designated in 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), § 2423(b), and§ 2423(e). 
17. The crimes committed against L.M. by Epstein were committed, on average, 
four times per month from the beginning of August 2002 through the end of October 
2005, the exact dates being unknown to L.M ..

18. 
In June 2008, after investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department, 
the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the 
United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, entered pleas of "guilty" to various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation 
of minors for prostitution and the procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution 
in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in the Palm Beach County, Florida. Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, is in the same position as if he had been tried and convicted of the sexual 
offenses committed against Plaintiff and, as such, must admit liability unto Plaintiff, 
Jane Doe No. 101. 
In this action, Plaintiff hereby exclusively seeks civil remedies 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255. 
19. As a condition of his plea, and in exchange for the Federal Government not 
prosecuting the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, for numerous federal offenses, Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal Government to 
the following: "Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the 
United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was 
prepared to name in an indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. 
Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
evidentiary burdens if any a Plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the 
parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 7 of 82
had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less." Plaintiff L.M. is covered by 
this paragraph and entitled to rights under this paragraph. 
20. The defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is thus estopped by his plea and agreement 
with the Federal Government from denying the acts alleged in this Complaint, and must 
effectively admit liability to the Plaintiff, L.M., including admitting liability for all counts 
enumerated in this Complaint. Plaintiff L.M. is entitled to damages, as further alleged 
below, including damages as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 2255, as amended by Pub. L. 
109-248, Title VII, § 707(b) and (c), 120 Stat. 650.
