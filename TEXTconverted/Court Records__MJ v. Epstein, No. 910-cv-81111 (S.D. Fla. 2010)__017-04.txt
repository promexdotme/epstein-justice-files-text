PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S NOTICE OF 90 DAYS EXPIRING  
ON MOTIONS TO COMPEL  
 
 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, pursuant to Local Rule 7.1.B.3, to give notice that more than 
90 days have elapsed on three pending motions regarding her case (No. 9:08-CV-
80893-KAM).  Because these motions are discovery motions, they were filed in the 
consolidated case (9:08-cv-80119-KAM) pursuant to this Court’s consolidation order.   
 
1. 
On July 10, 2009, Jane Doe filed (1) a Motion to Compel Responses to 
Plaintiff’s Request for Production (dkt. #194 in 9:08-cv-80119-KAM), (2) a Motion to 
Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production (dkt. #195), and (3) a Motion to 
Compel Answers to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories (dkt. #196).
