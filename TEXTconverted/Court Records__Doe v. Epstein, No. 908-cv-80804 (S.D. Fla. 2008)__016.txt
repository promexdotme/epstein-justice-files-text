CASE NO. 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Pursuant to Local Rule 12.1, as well as a proposed order on said motion. (True 
and correct copies of these documents are attached hereto as Exhibit A.) The 
Motion inaccurately certifies that opposing counsel conferred with counsel for 
the Defendants and that Defendants' counsel do not oppose the motion. Neither 
of the undersigned attorneys, whom are lmown to represent Defendant Haley 
Robson, were consulted in any way regarding this Motion and most certainly did 
not communicate to opposing counsel regarding whether said Motion would be 
opposed or not. Therefore the certification is incorrect as was the presentation to 
the Court of the Motion and the proposed order as being unopposed.

foregoing document with the Clerk of the Court using CM/ECF. I also certify that the
