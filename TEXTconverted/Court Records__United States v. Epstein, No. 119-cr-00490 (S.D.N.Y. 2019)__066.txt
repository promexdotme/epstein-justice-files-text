I. 
Preliminary Statement 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders 
concerning the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 61; Maxwell 
Dkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 1–3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 1–3). 
This memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted 
in the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63 
at 1–3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 1–3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process … not be 
at the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 61 
at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental 
submission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or 
others referenced in the transcripts.   
II. 
The Court’s Orders 
As the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 1–2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 1–2), the Second 
Circuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury 
records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d 
Cir. 1997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. 1973) (supplemental opinion) 
(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of 
grand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).1 The Second Circuit 
enumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions: 
 
1 There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1233 & n.6 (11th Cir. 
2020) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); In re Petition for Order Directing Release of 
Records, 27 F.4th 84, 90–91 (1st Cir. 2022) (same). In light of this split, when the Government 
sought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida 
from 2005 and 2007 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the 
Eleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Pitch—denied that motion. In re 
 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 2 of 10

(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure; (ii) whether the 
defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes 
the disclosure; (iii) why disclosure is being sought in the particular 
case; (iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure; 
(v) how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi) the 
current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that 
of their families; (vii) the extent to which the desired material—
either permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously made 
public; (viii) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who 
might be affected by disclosure are still alive; and (ix) the additional 
need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question. 
In re Craig, 133 F.3d at 106. 
On July 22, 2025, the Court directed the Government to file a memorandum of law 
“addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as germane to 
its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). The Court also directed the 
Government to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, counsel for the Government 
reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government provided notice to the 
victims of the motion to unseal,” and to submit: (1) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand jury 
materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of the 
Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein 
and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand 
jury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 
3).

III. 
Discussion 
A. 
The In re Craig Factors 
The Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [In re Craig] factors 
and any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 
at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follows is a discussion of each of the In re Craig factors, which 
are designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in 
public disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest 
and the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. In re Craig, 
131 F.3d at 104. 
1. 
The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure 
The first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the 
identity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106.   Here, 
the Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with 
increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.2 The Government’s position “serve[s] as 
a preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not 
dispositive.” Id.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can 
government opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknowledges the extraordinary 
 
2 See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at 
Federal Prison - United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and 
circumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense 
public interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the 119th Congress, on February 11, 2025, the 
Committee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a letter to the U.S. 
Department of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession 
regarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.’ On May 8, the Task Force 
sent another letter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein 
files’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).  
 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 4 of 10

4 
nature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the 
underlying proceedings. 
2. 
Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the 
Government Opposes the Disclosure 
The second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure 
of grand jury materials. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106; see also Lawyers’ Committee for 9/11 
Inquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285–86 (2d Cir. 2022) (affirming denial of motion to disclose 
grand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public 
disclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 800 F.2d 1293, 
1305 (4th Cir. 1986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and 
exhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).  
Defendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position.3 Defendant Maxwell 
has indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell 
Dkt. 793). 
3. 
Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case 
The third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. The Second Circuit in In re Craig held: “It is . . . entirely conceivable that 
in some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury 
information.” Id. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly 
expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes.  Beyond 
that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See In re Am. Hist. Ass’n, 49 F. 
 
3 As noted below, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family 
concerning the instant motion. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 5 of 10

5 
Supp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (applying In re Craig) (“Many historians … have spent 
countless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the 
public’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). Attention given to the 
Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2025 Memorandum 
announcing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.  
The instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in 
that memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information 
to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims. 
4. 
What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure 
The fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury 
transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). As 
stated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to 
appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein 
Dkt. 61 at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2). 
5. 
How Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place 
The fifth factor asks how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. In re Craig, 131 
F.3d at 106.  The grand jury met in June and July of 2019 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met 
in June and July of 2020 and March of 2021 in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has 
not dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107 (“if historical interest 
in a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that 
the public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 6 of 10

6. 
The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings 
and that of their Families 
The sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings 
and that of their families.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death 
of the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.” 
Id. at 106. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.” 
Id. 
In this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges 
proposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached 
the Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members 
previously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the 
Government responded to that request, and no litigation ensued.  Maxwell currently is 
incarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the 
motions. 
7. 
The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or 
Impermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public 
The Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly 
leaked to the public. 
Certain aspects and subject matters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial. 
To the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the 
Government’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.  
Many of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject 
of grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent 
and the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and 
some have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.  The 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 7 of 10

7 
Government is providing under seal a list of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand 
jury proceedings and a corresponding list noting which witnesses testified at trial. 
8. 
Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be 
Affected by Disclosure Are Still Alive 
The eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might 
be affected by disclosure are still alive.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106.  
Here, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings. 
There were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a 
detective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and 
Human Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.  
Both witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the 
Detective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.  
Consistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the 
grand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning 
victims, many of whom are still alive.  In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the 
Government will note which victims are still alive. 
9. 
Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the 
Particular Case in Question 
Finally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the 
particular case in question.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. In addition to the typical reasons for 
grand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying 
information related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the 
crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and 
which is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them. (See 
Epstein Dkt. 61 at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).

B. 
Additional Information 
The Court directed the Government to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, 
counsel for the Government reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the 
Government provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; 
Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3).  
Before filing the motions to unseal, relevant counsel for the Government reviewed the 
Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts. In addition, the Government has now provided notice 
to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at issue in this 
motion.  The Government has attempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have 
been unsuccessful.  In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other 
individuals identified in the transcripts. 
C. 
Provision of Materials to the Court 
The Court directed the Government to submit: (1) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand 
jury materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of 
the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein 
and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand 
jury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 
3).  As to the final category, the Government provides a description of all of the underlying 
materials presented to the grand jury as well as copies of, and proposed redactions to, certain 
materials presented to the grand jury. 
The Government is submitting these materials ex parte and under seal, as they relate to 
grand jury proceedings and include information related to victims, including but not limited to 
victim-identifying information of individuals who neither testified at trial or who were the subject 
of testimony at trial. The Government underscores that it takes very seriously its obligation to 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 9 of 10

protect victim-related information and therefore believes the proposed redactions not only are 
appropriate but are necessary to protect those rights.
