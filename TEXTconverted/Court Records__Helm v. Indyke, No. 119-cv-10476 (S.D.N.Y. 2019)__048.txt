THE COURT:  This is Judge Freeman.  We might have a
court reporter, but I'm going to record this call anyway, so
hold on while I set that up.
All right.  So this is Judge Freeman, and this is a 
conference in four of the cases against the Jeffrey Epstein 
estate:  Farmer v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10475; Helm v. Indyke, 
19 Civ. 10476; Bryant v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10479; and Doe 1000 v. 
Indyke, 19 Civ. 10577.   
If you are here for some other case or you think I got 
those numbers wrong, please make sure I know about it.   
But I'm going to ask for your appearances.  We have 
quite a number of people on the line.  Let me have the 
appearance first by plaintiff's counsel in these cases. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  Good morning.  This
is Sigrid McCawley from the law firm of Boies, Schiller &
Flexner, and I'm representing the plaintiffs in the actions
that you listed.  Along with me, I have my colleague Sabina
Mariella and Andrew Villacastin.  We also have a few of our
summer associates who have joined the line as well.
THE COURT:  All right.
Do I have a court reporter on the line? 
THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.  Good morning, Judge.  This
is Kristen Carannante.
THE COURT:  I'm going to ask anyone who is giving
appearances for the record to please spell your name.  So,

Ms. McCawley, if you could please spell your name and the names
of your colleagues.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course.  Sigrid McCawley, which is
spelled S-I-G-R-I-D, and the last name is McCawley,
M-c-C-A-W-L-E-Y.  I also have with me Sabina Mariella, which is
S-A-B-I-N-A M-A-R-I-E-L-L-A and Andrew Villacastin, and that's
A-N-D-R-E-W and Villacastin is V-I-L-L-A-C-A-S-T-I-N.  
THE COURT:  You are counsel in all of the cases that
are on for today?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Correct.  Correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Can I have defendants' counsel, please?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Again, this is Bennet
Moskowitz, B-E-N-N-E-T, last name M-O-S-K-O-W-I-T-Z, at
Troutman Sanders, for the co-executors in each of these cases.
My colleagues who handle the day-to-day discovery, 
Matthew Aaronson and Valerie Sirota, are on.  That's Matthew is 
M-A-T-T-H-E-W, last name is Aaronson, A-A-R-O-N-S-O-N; and 
Valerie, V-A-L-E-R-I-E, last name Sirota, S-I-R-O-T-A, and we 
are counsel for the co-executors in each of these cases. 
THE COURT:  All right.
Do I have any other attorneys who are on or 
representing plaintiffs in any of the other cases that are 
pending before the court?  No.  All right. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor --
THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. MENNINGER:  Sorry.  This is a defendant's counsel
for Ms. Maxwell, Laura Menninger.
THE COURT:  Oh, yes.
MS. MENNINGER:  I am in the 10475 case.
THE COURT:  Can you spell your name, please?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes.  It is L-A-U-R-A
M-E-N-N-I-N-G-E-R.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And, again, are there any other
attorneys on the line in any of the cases?
All right.  I'm going to assume, then, that anyone 
else on the phone is public or press and just ask you to please 
keep your lines muted.   
Sometimes on these calls we hear beeps which suggest 
that someone else may have joined in the call.  It can also 
suggest that someone may have dropped off the call.  And 
because of that, I will probably interrupt anyone who is 
speaking just to try to make sure that we didn't lose anybody 
or we didn't gain anyone we should know about.  It is not a 
courtroom where I can see people coming and going, so I just 
like to make sure we didn't accidentally lose one of the 
counsel who is supposed to be present.  And I apologize in 
advance for the interruptions. 
Do I have Hanna Martin on?
MS. MARTIN:  Yes, Judge, I'm here.
THE COURT:  Okay.  That's one of my law clerks, just

so you know.
All right.  So I have letters in these cases.  They
have come in clusters of letter and response and reply in the
three cases where Ms. Maxwell is not a party, and then there
are letters relating to her in the case where she is a party.
Let me start with the other cases where she is not the
party and deal with those letters first.  
Can I have, from Ms. McCawley, just a status update 
from you where things stand with your current request, with 
your understanding about potential settlements? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
So with respect to the requests, we have presented to 
the court a main threshold issue which has been unresolved at 
this point by the parties, and that is the issue of the time 
period within which the defendants, the estate, will produce 
documents.  That issue remains unresolved.   
It is the plaintiffs' position that documents for the 
entire relevant time period for each plaintiff, which runs from 
the date of their abuse, that year, to the present, are 
responsive and relevant to discovery in the case.  That goes to 
the evidence with respect to any of the conduct that Epstein 
was engaging in over those years that would prove the abuse, 
not simply, as in a car crash case, you don't just get the 
evidence of the date of the car crash, you get all evidence 
relating to anything that's relevant and could be used

potentially at trial.  Similarly, here, the defendants have 
attempted to limit the production to simply the year of the 
abuse or years of the abuse, if it happened in more than one 
year.  It is our position that all evidence relating to the 
over 20-year span of Epstein's abuse of not only our clients 
but other clients that are similarly situated, other women that 
are similarly situated, is highly relevant to the discovery in 
this matter.   
And of course, as your Honor knows, the plaintiff has 
the burden of proving her case in each of these instances, and 
the estate has taken the position of attempting to prove 
Epstein's innocence, therefore making all of this information 
highly relevant for the entire time period.   
This is similar to other cases that have come before 
in the Southern District of New York.  For example, Judge 
Sweet, in his case with one of the victims, allowed discovery 
for the entire time period from 2000 to the present; and that 
is, again, because, under 415, evidence of other abuse can be 
admissible at trial.  So we believe that the entire time period 
is highly relevant, and those documents need to be produced. 
The status of this, as of the date of filing our
letters, no documents have been produced.  In the last couple
of days, in Ms. Helm's case and in the Jane Doe 1000 case,
there has been one document produced by the defendants.  In the
case of Annie Farmer there have been three documents produced,

one of which was clawed back.  And in the case of Juliette
Bryant, there have been 90 documents produced, and that is on
their side.
So we are still in a position where we have not
received any substantial document production in this case.  The
court will remember that, back on January 28 -- the cases were
filed in November.  Back on January 28 we sent -- after your
hearing that you had in December asking them to preserve
documents, we sent a document preservation letter that outlined
in very specific detail the e-mail accounts for which we were
aware of that Mr. Epstein had utilized.
You are going to hear today, and you saw in the 
filings from the defendant about their claims of burdens, they 
have not justified burden at this point.  They have thrown 
around a number of 700,000 documents.  I will tell you that we 
have already gone through 600,000 documents in just Annie's 
case alone for our production.  They have not produced a hit 
list to show burden or otherwise establish why our request 
would be so burdensome.   
So with respect to -- and that is only -- now, they 
are only still responding to the time period that is the one- 
or two-year window, depending on the particular plaintiff.  So 
at this stage we do not have -- that is still the threshold 
issue that we are asking this court to resolve.  We need that 
issue resolved before we can undertake depositions or get this

case moving, because we at this point have no documents of any 
substance from the other side.  So that is the key issue that 
we have put before the court for resolution.   
They have produced supplemental interrogatory 
responses.  Again, those are still limited to the time period 
that they have set forth.  They have not agreed to produce 
information for the entire time period at this point.   
So that is the key issue that we put before the court 
that we need resolution on it in order to be able to move these 
cases forward at this point.   
THE COURT:  All right.  Before I ask some questions
about that, let me just ask about potential for settlement of
these cases.  What is plaintiffs' understanding?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Potential for settlement in these
cases, as your Honor knows, there was the proposal of a
potential claims administration program that came about in the
fall of this past year.  That program has been through a series
of back-and-forth between the U.S. Virgin Islands' A.G. and the
estate, with input from the various plaintiffs' attorneys, as
well.  The program has not yet been approved.  It has made
headway, but it has not yet been approved to move forward.
There are still issues with respect to a release and other
matters, so that has not gotten off the ground at all.  So
there have been no substantive settlement discussions of any
kind in these cases.

K5m2FarC                  
And, again, if --
THE COURT:  If the program --
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.
THE COURT:  If the program gets off the ground, the
program as you understand it to be fashioned, would these
plaintiffs be likely to participate in it?
MS. McCAWLEY:  We would still have to have those final
conversations with the clients pending what the final outcome
of the program is, but they have all been interested in trying
to participate in a program if it does go forward.
Our concern, of course, is that that program has been 
delayed and has not moved forward, so we have had the need to 
press  forward with our case.  Of course, in that program, too, 
any offer that could be made could be very substandard, where 
our clients would want to proceed with the merits of their 
action, which is why we are here before the court trying to 
seek resolution of our clients' claims, because there is no 
guarantee with respect to that program whatsoever.  So we are 
in a position where we need to and want to move forward with 
discovery without further delay to be able to get to the merits 
of our clients' claims.   
Any discovery they would receive in these matters 
would be relevant anyway to those discussions with our 
presenting claims to the claims administrator.  So we see that 
as coinciding and being relevant and responsive to Epstein

being able to establish our claim, again, before the claims 
administrator. 
THE COURT:  All right.  And going back to your request
to compel discovery from defendant, you say that the time frame
is the issue.  I believe the letter was presented, it appeared
to say in general you hadn't gotten discovery responses to
document requests or interrogatories, and then you highlighted
this issue.  Is this really the key issue or the only issue or
are there other issues with respect to just not getting
responses?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, you are correct, your Honor.  At
the time we wrote the initial letter, the responses were --
there were not responses, there were just objections.  They
have since supplemented their responses but, again, limiting it
only to the time frame.  So we still may have issues with those
responses, because at this point we only can see them as to the
time period within which they are saying the abuse victims --
that time period where they were abused, so we don't believe
that they are fulsome at this point.  But if the court could
resolve the threshold issue of whether or not they have to
produce for the entire time period, they would then supplement,
or our assumption is that they would supplement their responses
both to interrogatories and to the requests for production, and
then we could evaluate at that point if it appears there is
anything missing.

K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  And why would it not be the case that,
document request by document request or interrogatory by
interrogatory, the inquiry might be different as to what time
frame would be appropriate to look at?  There might be some,
depending upon how the request is framed, where it would be
appropriate to look at a longer time frame; and there may be
some, based on the nature of the request, where that would not
make sense to look at a longer time frame.  Why should I be
doing this on a global basis?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, that's a very fair question, your
Honor.  So the requests, for example, seek information
related -- like the request number one is information related
to the plaintiff including diary, diaries, journals, calendars,
any information, travel itineraries that relate to that
plaintiff, and that could be in any time period.  For example,
if Epstein's last year was talking about one of our client's
and had information that he had recorded in an e-mail about one
of our clients, that would be responsive.
So the time period does pertain, in my view, to all of
the requests.  We have not -- they have not come to us and said
a particular request only applies for these reasons to one
particular year.  In my view, the request, for example, for
flight logs, if there are not flight logs in a certain year,
they would only produce what they have, obviously.  But if they
have flight logs for the entire time period, we would want

those.  So it is -- your Honor is correct that there can be
some request-specific issues, but they haven't agreed to
produce anything outside of the year of the abuse at this
point.
THE COURT:  Are there some requests that relate to
people other than your clients?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Other than --
MS. McCAWLEY:  For example -- yes.
So as I said before, it is our position that, with 
respect to our clients' claims in each of the cases, 
information relating to Epstein's abuse of other victims is 
highly relevant under 415, particularly to establish that this 
pattern of luring in young girls in the same way, for example, 
with saying they are interviewing for a modeling job or saying 
they are coming for an assistant's interview, the pattern of 
how he lured girls in, then abused them is relevant to our 
clients presenting their claims to the jury to prove the truth 
of the fact that they have before, as well, abused in a similar 
manner.  So we firmly believe that that information is highly 
relevant to the case.   
Again, the estate has taken the position, and you have 
seen it in our filings, that Epstein is innocent, and we have 
to prove the truth of that, as well as with respect to all of 
these cases.  So we are in a position where we are having to

fight to get discovery from the estate.  I would was certainly 
hoping it would not be this kind of a battle.  I was hoping 
that now that he is no longer taking his Fifth Amendment 
privileges, no longer with us, that we would be able to get 
substantive discovery in a more streamlined manner, but that is 
not the case.   
And any threshold issue is very important because it 
implicates our clients' ability to be able to present their 
case and to be able to substantively be able to depose witness.  
As your Honor knows our discovery deadline is looming in early 
July.  We need to be able to take the depositions of various 
people who either interacted with our clients or who were 
witnesses to the abuses that occurred in Epstein's various 
homes, and we need the information and the documents from his 
files that establish and relate to the abuse, and those are the 
requests that we have put forward. 
THE COURT:  All right.  I have some thoughts on this,
but let me hear from defendants first.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Bennet Moskowitz.
If I may, I would like to address the program issue
first, which I think is much quicker than the discovery.  My
colleague, Matt Aaronson, will discuss the discovery issues, if
that's okay.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. McCAWLEY:  So I am very, very surprised to hear

Ms. McCawley give a presentation that seems like her clients
are lukewarm on the program.  She is on the e-mails from this
week where Brad Edwards, who represents five plaintiffs and we
understand the vast majority of claimants all of whom want to
participate in the program according to him, announced to us on
the estate side that he was able to get the Attorney General to
finally step aside and let the program move forward.  So my
first surprise is hearing that Ms. McCawley thinks that the
program is still in some vast limbo.  It is not for all of the
reasons that I discussed this morning, which Ms. McCawley is
aware of.
THE COURT:  Hold on a second.  We have two separate
conferences.  One was at 10:00 and this one is 11:00.  So when
you say that we discussed this morning, Ms. McCawley, unless
she didn't announce herself, was not on that call and doesn't
know what you said at that conference.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
MS. McCAWLEY:  (Inaudible).
THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  This is Sigrid McCawley.  
I was unaware of the 10:00 conference call.  I'm 
sorry. 
THE COURT:  We had a conference call in certain of the
other cases with different plaintiffs' counsel where there were
somewhat different issues raised.

MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  And I am trying --
THE COURT:  I'm trying to cluster these so we don't
have to have a marathon session with all cases at once.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I am happy to concisely, as best I
can, go through the same points, and I will say now that I know
Ms. McCawley knows all of the following with perhaps one
exception, which I will explain.
Ms. McCawley knows that around 69 individual 
claimants, including her clients, have publicly come forward to 
voice overwhelming support for the program, including to the 
USVI probate court.  We know that is the vast majority of known 
claimants.  We are aware of only one claimant who is a state 
court plaintiff who has publicly said that she is not 
participating, and that was through her counsel, and I don't 
even know if that's that person's current position.   
Ms. McCawley also knows that seven plaintiffs in the 
SDNY action, including one of her clients, Maria Farmer, most 
recently stayed their actions in favor of the program.  It 
bears mentioning that Maria Farmer's -- you know, the 
stipulation in that regard goes contrary to everything 
Ms. McCawley just said.   
Your Honor entered that order, so I don't think I need 
to repeat it verbatim.  But mentioned in there was the notion 
of conserving resources, and in that regard, as a side note, it 
bears mentioning that Boies Schiller has been the biggest

culprit in driving up the estate's litigation cost, money that 
will never be available for their clients or other alleged 
victims in the program.  We don't understand that.  We were 
staffed very leanly until recently, just me and an associate.  
Five attorneys on their side, including three partners.  I have 
lawyers, my colleagues are on now for the team more recently, 
because Boies Schiller takes the most unreasonable positions on 
discovery, grossly overbroad view -- again, Mr. Aaronson will 
get to that -- and they make the most constant threat to motion 
practice notwithstanding their clients participating in the 
program.  
Ms. McCawley also knows that the protocol for the
program, which was done in close consultation between the
administrator and designers and claimants' counsel, including
hers, her firm, and with -- in between co-executors is nearly
finalized.  
And Ms. McCawley also knows the only reason this 
hasn't gone forward until now was because of the USVI Attorney 
General.  But again, Mr. Edwards announced a couple of days ago 
in an email that Ms. McCawley is on that that last, quote, 
lingering issue, as Mr. Edwards put it, is now resolved.  And, 
again, there are a few less contentious matters to iron out, 
but it is our firm expectation that by sometime next week that 
resolution in principle will be formalized.   
The sole thing that Ms. McCawley may not be aware of

            (212) 805-0300

is that if something unexpected happens and that resolution in 
principle is not finalized, then by June 15, our current intent 
on the estate side is to move forward with the program absent 
the probate court entering an order directing us not to or 
otherwise impeding that, and I don't think that's going to 
happen because another person who has voiced support for the 
program is the probate judge who, on February 4, at a hearing 
that Ms. McCawley attended, as did David Boies, the probate 
judge said the following:  "I think we agreed that everybody 
believes this program is a great program."   
So I will say that I don't understand why we get one 
display of overwhelming support from Boies Schiller and others 
when we are not before your Honor, and then we come before your 
Honor and I hear a different story.  The program is going to go 
forward very soon.  I am confident of that.  And I'm confident 
that, per Ms. McCawley's own statements, all of her clients, 
not just the one who stayed her action already, are going to 
participate.  So, again, every dollar we are spending in the 
meantime is money that will never be available for that 
program.   
That's all I have to say on the program aspect.  
Unless your Honor has questions, I will refer to my colleague, 
Mr. Aaronson, to address the discovery issues. 
THE COURT:  Let me hear the discovery issues.

Aaronson.
I want to correct a couple of misstatements that 
Ms. McCawley made.   
It is not the estate's position that documents that 
relate to the claims asserted by the plaintiffs will not be 
produced.  In fact, all of our discovery responses have 
identified that to the extent the request seeks information 
about plaintiffs, they will be produced.   
We also identified to your Honor in the letter that we 
sent to you -- 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  Let me interrupt you.  Without
regard to time frame or only within a specific time frame?
MR. AARONSON:  I was about to clarify that.  We said
in our letter to your Honor without regard to time frame with
respect to the plaintiffs.  And in fact, that is something
that, your Honor, the problem we have here is, we were still
under the impression we were meeting and conferring with
plaintiffs' counsel on these issues, and we put that in our
letter.  And before we could even -- you know, we told them we
would consider their positions, and before we could even
conclude that, they filed a letter with the court.  I think you
are aware, our initial letter to the court said that we were
sort of surprised by that and we are saying it is premature.
We still think these issues are premature.  
But the simple fact is, your Honor, our position is we

are producing any documents that reference orally to the 
plaintiffs.  And in fact we have searched documents for that.  
So there is no dispute there, there is no issue there.   
We are not saying that the time period for documents 
relating to plaintiff is limited in that way, shape, or form.  
What we did say was, these are events in some situations, 
Theresa Helm, incidents that happened on one day in 2002, and 
we are saying it is not proportional to ask for our client, the 
estate, to search for documents relating to a 20 -- I guess it 
would be a 19-year period, your Honor, relating to people who 
may have worked at a property that Mr. Epstein owned and in 
fact property that Mr. Epstein -- Ms. Helm doesn't allege she 
ever visited.  You know, it's a scope issue.   
But, again, to the extent there is an allegation that 
Ms. Helm -- I'm sorry, there is a document that references 
Ms. Helm, we have agreed to produce it.  We searched for those 
documents.  And the same applies for all of the plaintiffs.   
So I want to make it very clear that that is a 
misstatement of what our position is. 
You know, again, the scope here is just so overbroad,
beyond plaintiff, that we think it is not proportional to the
case.  We disagree completely with Ms. McCawley's statement
that any of that discovery is necessary for her to prove her
claims.  Her claims in this case are a simple claim of battery.
That's the claim in this case.  That's her burden to prove and

K5m2FarC                  
that is it.  And we have agreed to provide documents that
relate to her claims.  If she says she was at a property on a
certain date, we have identified to the best of our ability
people who may have been at that property that date.
You know, I'm not sure what more we are obligated to 
do, your Honor.  And this is a part of the problem.  If they 
have complaints about search terms, then meet with us to talk 
about search terms.  Before we could finish the process, they 
ran into court.  We are open to a dialogue.  We have always 
been open to a dialogue to try to resolve these issues.  But, 
as we told you, they prematurely went to court to try to -- you 
know, to try to get in front of your Honor before we could even 
finish that. 
We have a lot of requests, your Honor, that are just
completely unrelated to these cases.  I don't think it's
appropriate now to go through each one right now.  But I just
wanted to clarify that this concept that it is a -- we are not
agreeing to produce documents about the plaintiffs is wholly
untrue, and I just wanted to make that very clear.
THE COURT:  Okay.  So let me go back on plaintiffs'
side.  I'm not going to make any blanket ruling, and I'm not
persuaded that you have conferred fully in good faith before
bringing the motion, in part, because you have already said
that some of it is moot because in fact when you got responses,
you no longer had a complete absence of information, and now

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
you are really just focused on the time frame issue.  That
tells me that when you wrote the initial letter you hadn't
conferred fully in good faith to see what really had to be put
before the court.
With respect to the time frame issue, it sounds like 
defendant is prepared to and planning to produce documents 
without regard to time frame that refer to your clients or 
relate to your clients, and it also sounds like defendants are 
willing to confer with respect to other requests.   
As far as those other requests go, the test for 
relevance is not whether something is relevant to a general 
subject matter of a case, it's whether it is relevant to a 
claim or defense asserted in the case.  It may be with respect 
to some of the requests where time frame is at issue that the 
documents sought are in fact highly relevant to a defense 
that's been asserted in the case, for example.  It may be that 
they are tangentially relevant.  It may be the burden is great.  
It may be the burden is modest.  It may be that -- let me just 
make sure I didn't lose counsel.   
Do I still have plaintiffs' counsel? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do I still have defendants' counsel?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  If anyone joined from the public or
press, I will please ask you to mute your phone.

Did anyone join who is an attorney in one of the cases
in front of me?  No.  All right.
I lost the thread a little bit of what I was saying, 
but the point is that if this is in front of me with 
particularized disputes, I'm going to have to look at each 
document request at issue or each interrogatory at issue, hear 
from the parties about the particular relevance to a claim or a 
defense, hear from the defendant about the particular arguable 
lack of relevance or burden, and make item-by-item 
determinations.  I'm not going to do it in a blanket fashion, 
and you are going to have to confer on that kind of level to 
get it focused for me, if it comes back to me, so that I 
understand just what the documents are that are being sought, 
just what the claim of relevance is, just what the purported 
burden is, just what the proportionality is so that I can make 
that assessment balancing relevant factors. 
Now, the other issue that we have is resources and
settlement and whether the dollars that are spent by 
defendants in litigating the case and responding to discovery
requests might be better spent by being put into a fund if
plaintiffs are planning to participate in that and whether it
is a consideration that I should take into account, whether we
should have any kind of extended period of time for the
responses so that you can see if you are going to participate
in the program if the kinks are worked out.

K5m2FarC                  
In the earlier conference we had today, what I did was 
allow the parties to have a bit of a hiatus in their cases, to 
conserve resources, asking for a status letter by June 19 with 
the understanding that the estate was planning to move forward 
with the program no later than June 15 absent something they 
thought would be extraordinary to stop it from doing so. 
So on plaintiffs' side, let me hear whether you think
it makes sense to give it a window of time before there is
increased attorney's fees spent to see if in fact that program
is moving forward and you might be participating in it.
And in any event, let me hear what you have to say 
about my view that perhaps you should be conferring further in 
good faith about these time frame issues on a 
request-by-request basis. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course, your Honor.  This is Sigrid
McCawley for the plaintiff.
With respect to the issue of a hiatus, my concern
there would be that we, as you know, back in November, talked
about this program, and while Mr. Moskowitz has made
representations on this call, you will understand that those
were the same representations that he was making back in
December and January and, for a number of reasons, that program
has just not moved forward.  Now I'm hearing for the first time
this June 15 date that I have not heard before.
The problem I see with any kind of hiatus -- and, to

K5m2FarC                  
be clear, we don't want to, of course, expend unnecessary 
estate resources.  The issue that I have with that is it is the 
continued delay and the part of the disadvantage to my clients 
in that they don't have information, all of the information 
they need relevant to their claims because they haven't 
received -- even though we have tried diligently, they have not 
received substantial production in the case of any kind.   
So with respect to a hiatus, my concern would be that 
right now our discovery deadline is set for early July.  We 
were hoping to get documents in order to be able to start 
taking some of the necessary depositions to get information for 
our case to be able to move it forward, and I believe that is 
something that we would be entitled to.  I think that my 
concern is that, again, it would be a July 15 date, then it 
would be -- I'm sorry, a June 15 date, then a July 15 date, and 
it would continue without us being able to move the case 
forward.   
Also, as you know, the claims program is voluntary.  
So to the extent that a client does participate in that and 
gets paused, we don't know what that claims administration 
program is going to ultimately prove to be.  So to the extent 
that a client participates and is offered something or not 
offered anything, their case should be moving forward so that 
they are able to go to trial on the merits of their claims, if 
they need to, against the estate.  So that would be my concern

with making any change at this point.   
Again, we are not -- the discovery, in my view, has 
moved very, very slowly.  So just to pull back and not have 
them continue to engage with us on discovery, in my view, would 
be problematic, because it would just further delay the case.   
So those are my concerns generally with respect to 
that.   
And, again, I'm hearing from the other side this June 
15 date that I have no confidence that that is something that 
will necessarily move forward because we don't have anything in 
writing with respect to that or any statement from the court in 
the USVI that they have approved that or anything of that 
nature.  So that was my concern there. 
With respect to the issue before the court, we are in
a position where the time frame issue is significantly
problematic to us for the reasons that I have outlined.  While
they are representing to the court today that they will produce
documents related to the plaintiff, you will remember that we
have --
THE COURT:  What did they say in their responses that
you got in?  Did they say these documents will be produced or
is it just they are saying this for the first time to the court
today?
MS. McCAWLEY:  With respect to the plaintiff, they
represented they would run the name of the plaintiff in their

discovery searches and produce with respect to the plaintiff,
yes, that they did.  
THE COURT:  Why -- 
MS.McCAWLEY:  But the problem --
THE COURT:  Why did you tell me earlier on in the call
that they were refusing to produce any documents for the later
time frame even with regard to the plaintiff?
MS.McCAWLEY:  That is my understanding of their
position, your Honor.  I am hearing now that they are saying --
well, first of all, they have only produced one document for
Theresa Helm's case, one document for Jane Doe's case.
THE COURT:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This is
complete lack of meaningful dialogue between the parties,
because I'm hearing opposite things from the parties about what
defendants' position is.  Defendant, as I understand it from
this call, has said that they will, and have told you that they
will, produce documents regardless of time frame if they refer
or relate to the plaintiff, and that they are doing that in
fact in all cases and have not taken a position that they would
not.  And you are saying that is your understanding of their
position, that they will not.
How can that be if you have had a good conference 
between you? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, as we set forth in our
letter, we did have a two-hour conference where we asked them

about the time frame issues and made sure to get the full
position on that because that was our biggest concern.  And
that is what we discretely presented to the court because that
was the concern we have, that they were not going to be
producing anything beyond the time period of the abuse.
(Indiscernible crosstalk) 
THE COURT:  -- discretely presented to the court.  You
presented to the court in your opening letter that there was a
complete failure to respond to any of the requests, and now you
tell me on the call that since then there has been a response,
and so what is now being discretely presented on this telephone
call is what you say is a remaining issue, which seems like it
is only a remaining issue in part because it seemed like if
there are documents specifically relating or referring to the
plaintiff, defendants have agreed to produce it and according
to defendants have told you they have agreed to produce it in
their responses that you have since gotten.  Now, I haven't
seen those responses.  If they have been put before me, I'm
sorry, I have not reviewed them.  I don't think I have them.
For that matter, I'm not sure I have all of the requests, I'm
not sure I have an item-by-item explanation of relevance, and
I'm not sure that your discussion has been adequate between the
lawyers.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for
the plaintiff.

I appreciate that.  I am hearing your Honor.  We will 
go back and address these issues again with the defendants in 
the hopes of being able to resolve them and not hopefully have 
to come before the court with respect to them.  We are, again, 
hopeful to be able to get discovery in this case.  We do not 
believe that has been the situation that we are in presently, 
and that's why we have presented it to the court.  But I 
understand your point, your Honor, and we will make sure to 
engage further in the hopes of being able to resolve this. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me ask, on defendants'
side, by when do you plan to produce -- assuming we have no
stay of discovery here and no hiatus, by when do you plan to
produce the documents referring or relating to plaintiff?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We have already started that, your
Honor.  Bennet Moskowitz, excuse me.  And in fact, I apologize.
Let me let Mr. Aaronson address that question.  And then, if I
can, I would like to just very quickly respond to something
Ms. McCawley said about the program.
THE COURT:  Let me hear first about the documents -- 
MR. AARONSON:  Yes -- 
THE COURT:  -- regarding the production.
MR. AARONSON:  Yes, your Honor.  Matthew Aaronson.  
We have already started the production.  We made a 
production I believe on Wednesday of documents, and I think in 
particular Ms. Bryant it was over 100 documents.

So with the process underway -- and, again, I think, 
your Honor, you have gotten this correct, is that we have told 
them that we will produce and search for -- search for and 
produce documents that relate to their clients.  To the extent 
that they think we need to add additional search terms, we 
searched the individual plaintiffs' names.  If there are 
additional search terms, we are open to a dialogue to discuss 
that.  If there are additional terms, as in every case, whether 
or not we can reach agreements on those terms.  You know, the 
thing -- 
THE COURT:  I would like to put a deadline on getting
the production complete with respect to any documents that in
any way refer or relate to the plaintiffs after you have had
some further discussion perhaps on search terms, if necessary.
But I would like to have a firm date when you are not just
producing a few documents and a few documents and say it is
underway, that that actually gets produced.  Once -- 
MR. AARONSON:  That's fair, your Honor.  Part of that
goes back to the same issue you raised earlier about the
expenditure of time and money on discovery issues versus
putting it towards the program.  
So to the extent the court is not inclined to issue a 
pause or some sort of temporary issue on that, it's hard to 
say.  The problem we have is that, you know, it is difficult to 
search all of our files, given the pandemic.  Some files have

not been able to be collected yet.  So I can tell you that, of 
the electronic documents that we have collected, I think we can 
keep that probably within 30 days of what we have collected 
already.   
But I will tell you, we have done the initial pass of 
that, and we have made those productions.  As I said, Juliette 
Bryant there was a significant number of documents.  Presumably 
other plaintiffs there were not.  So, again, we do believe that 
it would be appropriate (unintelligible) some of this, but to 
the extent the court is not inclined to do that, you know, I 
think 30 days for what we have.  But to be clear, your Honor, I 
don't know that we have collected every, you know, source at 
this point in time, given our inability to collect documents 
dues to the pandemic. 
THE COURT:  How has the pandemic affected your ability
to collect documents specifically?
MR. AARONSON:  I will let Mr. Moskowitz speak to that,
but my understanding is, you know, that we have not been able
to access and people are not traveling to different locations.
So we have collected electronic documents.  I'm not -- again,
I'm deferring to Mr. Moskowitz on that, whether or not the
additional documents are still out there.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  Bennet Moskowitz.  Happy to
clarify that point, your Honor.
There are two -- let me take a step back.  Yes.  It is

true that we have collected over 700 and I think 40,000 
documents, and we did search them for the plaintiffs' names.  
And we did produce what we found that wasn't privileged, and we 
will go back and make sure that that is complete.  But the fact 
that we located many documents for Juliette Bryant, which were 
dated to as late as I believe last year and have already been 
produced, so I don't understand Ms. McCawley's confusion about 
the time frame issue.  But in any event, the fact that we found 
those but didn't find such documents for the other cases just 
evidences a lack of documents, not something wrong with the 
search process.   
In terms of the pandemic difficulties, my problem with 
making a 30-day blanket representation is that there are at 
least some hard copy files that I would like certain people to 
look through, and while I have no reason one way or the other 
to expect their responsive materials are there, I would like 
that to happen before such deadline, and I'm not 100 percent 
certain that it can, because at least some of the documents are 
in places that are still under lockdown or there are still 
health concerns.   
In addition to that, this is somewhat subject to the 
disputes about the scope of the discovery.  If Ms. McCawley is, 
let's say, correct and these cases -- everything related to any 
allegedly bad thing Mr. Epstein ever did is relevant in each 
action, well, then, it could take me, you know, six months or a

year to finish looking for every piece of paper and every 
property Mr. Epstein owned.  So, again, it's with the context 
of just searching for names.  Mr. Aaronson is correct, that can 
be done in the next 30 days, with the exception of anything 
that we can't actually access to look through.   
And again I have -- 
THE COURT:  You have already --
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.
THE COURT:  You already have the documents
electronically, at least certain of the documents, most of the
documents.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.
THE COURT:  And you have already gone through them and
you have already made some production.  Why would you need
another 30 days before you can get to the end of that
particular road?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We may not.  It really depends on the
rest of the meet-and-confer process which never completed.  It
depends on the search terms that are proposed, whether there
are any additional search terms proposed.  For example, what we
wanted to happen during a full meet-and-confer process, which
is what we strive to do in every case, and what we are actually
doing in other actions against the estate, that Boies Schiller
is not involved with, is suggest search terms to us that you
think would satisfy your view of what a particular request

entails, let us run the report.  If the report comes back and
says 500 documents or even a thousand, we may deem that
reasonable for that request.  If it comes back at 10,000, we
may not deem that reasonable.
So this is part of what an ongoing discussion, I hope, 
would have entailed, which gives me pause to, again, say a 
blanket yes, we will get it all done in 30 days.  As to 
searching for things, I mentioned the plaintiffs in what we 
have already collected, to the extent we didn't complete that, 
you know, we don't need 30 days.  But I don't know that that 
will satisfy Ms. McCawley. 
THE COURT:  Okay.
If this case goes all the way forward in litigation
and goes to trial, you are going to try this case.  You are not
going to try ever case that is before this court or any other
court at the same trial.  That doesn't mean that evidence
regarding others who are claiming to have been victims of
Mr. Epstein might not have relevance to some claim or defenses
being raised, and I understand that it may, in some documents,
may have relevance.  
But you are going to have to get, on plaintiffs' side, 
a lot more focused with what you want and why you want it.  And 
if you are going to come back and make a renewed application to 
me, that application is going to have to be more focused on 
what kind of documents you are talking about, what claim or

defense they are relevant to, why they are relevant to that 
claim or defense, giving me an example of some case law that 
shows how it could be relevant, and I will make a decision on a 
request-by-request basis about what appropriate time frames 
should be used.  And with respect to search terms, in the first 
instance you need to talk to each other about that because you 
don't want the court coming up with search terms or trying to 
make judgment calls on that if it's not necessary.  You know, 
you are much better off trying to figure it out between you, 
getting an agreed protocol, an agreed list of custodians, an 
agreed list of search terms, and then go from there, as 
generally happens in cases where there might be a lot of 
documents that are kept electronically.  So I expect you to go 
through that process as you would in any other case.   
I am open to kicking out your deadlines a bit to give 
you time to talk this through and to see if we can get some 
progress.  I'm going to ask defendants, to the extent you 
already have a known universe of documents, if there are any 
you have not yet produced, get them produced within two weeks.  
If there are additional search terms, you will talk with each 
other in good faith about time frame for running any additional 
searches and getting any additional documents produced.  And if 
plaintiff wanted to come back to me on a renewed motion that's 
more specifically laid out on particular categories of 
documents or responses to interrogatories, you will do that

after you have tried to work these things through with an eye 
toward what is what is reasonable.  Plaintiff may reasonably 
need more than defendants want to give.  Defendants may have a 
reasonable point about conserving resources for the sake of a 
settlement program which should be taken seriously because it 
seems that very serious efforts are underway to try to get that 
program off the ground. 
I'm going to ask for a status letter by June 19, which
is the date that I gave in other cases.  It is geared to
Mr. Moskowitz's representation that this program should launch,
he thinks, by June 15.  So it seems to me by June 19 you will
have a better idea and you will also have a better idea of
where you are with respect to these discovery issues.
I'm going to caution plaintiffs' counsel in the
future, please do not send me something without being sure you
are at the end of the road in talking to your adversary.  I
don't want to get a response that says it is premature, we
haven't really talked.  Make sure you are clear on a
point-by-point basis that you have talked about specific
relevance, that you have talked about specific burden issues,
that you have talked about specific search terms, at least you
have try to engage in that kind of dialogue.  If you are
stymied, you are stymied, and I will hear from you.  But I
don't think you are at that point.
And I think that's it with respect to those disputes,

and I should probably turn to the dispute regarding
Ms. Maxwell.  What I am going to do is I am going to -- I don't
know if the letters were framed as a motion for a conference or
a motion to compel.  If they were framed as a motion for a
conference, I will say granted.  We had a conference.  As to
the underlying issue about compelling, go talk or in if
actually framed as a motion, I will say denied without
prejudice to renew, and I'm going to ask for a status letter by
June 19.  
Anybody want to say anything else on that before I 
turn to Ms. Maxwell's issue? 
No?  Okay.  I'm hearing no, or I am hearing nothing.  
Hopefully I haven't lost everybody on the entire call.  I'm 
hearing laughs, so hopefully that means not. 
Let me turn to Ms. Menninger's issue.  One thing I
want to understand, because there was a reference to a
potential criminal prosecution which of course could impact
whether there should be a stay as to a defendant who is being
criminally prosecuted.  Currently, if I'm understanding
correctly, Ms. Maxwell may be the target of an investigation,
or you may be concerned she is the target of an investigation
but there are no actual criminal charges pending, is that
right?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, that's correct, your Honor.  We
do not have any criminal charges pending anywhere, but we have

a number of public statements by the U.S. Attorney's office in
the Southern District, as well as statements made by
plaintiffs' counsel to the press that suggest that those --
that that investigation is underway and that it would encompass
Ms. Maxwell, and so that is our concern.  But it is correct to
say that there is no active criminal charges that I am aware
of.
THE COURT:  All right.  So if there were active
criminal charges filed or if that should happen, that might
influence the thinking about whether or not there should be a
stay, because of course if a defendant ends up taking the
Fifth, that could have consequences in a civil case and
defendant may feel there is little choice but to do that if the
person is under a criminal indictment or if plaintiffs have
filed.
So I just want to just note that if that circumstance 
change -- if that circumstance changes, let me know.  If it 
affects any ruling I make, let me know, because I may need to 
revisit a ruling. 
Let me hear what -- given the last conference, the
last subject, where there seem to be some changed landscapes
since the application was initially made, let me make sure that
I am aware of the current circumstance.
Let me just hear from Ms. Maxwell's counsel first on 
this.

MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor, Ms. Menninger
here on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.
The landscape has not changed since our letters.  We 
have filed a motion to dismiss the claims which we believe are 
distinct and different from any sort of example that the estate 
may have, and we believe that they are strong grounds for 
dismissal.  The case -- the allegations against Ms. Maxwell in 
this case involve an allegation of battery that occurred one 
time in 1996 in New Mexico, and the statute of limitations and 
venue issues, you know, in New York versus New Mexico are very 
different for Maxwell than perhaps for the estate and we think 
provide the grounds for dismissal. 
The other two bases that we raise for a stay are the
claims program that your Honor has already spent some time
discussing on this call and the earlier call today.  We
believe -- we don't have any independent information.  We were
not party to the calls in the Virgin Islands, as were counsel
for plaintiffs and for the estate.  But I have heard on the
call today the representations made by the estate that they
believe that the program will be getting off the ground in a
matter of a few weeks, June 15, or three weeks or so from
today.  
Given that plaintiff has indicated an intent to 
participate in that program, at least in filings in the Virgin 
Islands, and the fact that that program would -- if she

participates and it is successful, would render this entire 
lawsuit moot, we think we believe balancing that fact against 
the extremely broad discovery demands that your Honor has heard 
something about, although not with respect to Ms. Maxwell yet, 
would counsel in favor of at least a short stay similar to the 
ones that other plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to, promoted, 
or even stipulated to in other cases pending before your Honor.   
We have received extensive discovery demands.  We have 
been advised that plaintiffs' counsel intends to take a number 
of depositions, including around the country, including for 
people that plaintiff in our case never met and had no dealings 
with.  And, your Honor, I can speak from personal experience 
with that same type of discovery happening with the same 
plaintiffs' counsel in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action that I was 
counsel for in front of Judge Sweet.  We had a number of 
significant discovery disputes in that case and we had 
depositions that occurred not only across the country, from 
California to New York and Florida and many places in between, 
but also abroad in that case, and the litigation costs were in 
the hundreds of thousands easily in that case.  And so looking 
at the pattern of discovery that I believe plaintiff intends to 
pursue here, balancing the costs of those to someone like my 
client, who is not a multimillionaire, and then viewing the 
claims program as something that could be successful in 
resolving this case in a short period of time, we would ask

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
your Honor to consider putting a stay on discovery in the 
Farmer case that I am party to, or I am counsel for a party to.   
I think I can second or third some of the things that 
have already been said earlier, so I don't want to waste the 
court's time with those.  But we have concerns that any money 
spent on this litigation is going to reduce the amount of money 
that would be available to any of the accusers in the Virgin 
Islands, and we don't think it makes sense to spend the money 
on these broad discovery requests if we can get the case 
resolved shortly.   
I think the only objection that I heard from 
plaintiffs' counsel to something like a hiatus was that there's 
a pending discovery cutoff of early July, and it seems to me 
reasonable that of course if the claims program gets off the 
ground in a few weeks, that discovery cutoff could be set out 
to see if it is successful or not.  And so it is sort of a 
false premise to say that the discovery cutoff in July is the 
reason we should be forging ahead full steam with this 
expensive discovery, rather than just taking the more logical 
approach, to me, which would be to at least put it on hold to 
see if the claims program is successful in the first instance; 
and, if not, then the cases can proceed with the court's 
blessing, pick back up where we left off.   
In this particular case, I think it also bears noting 
that the claim allegedly occurred in 1996, so it has been some

24 years since the allegations supposedly happened, and so I 
don't see that waiting one or two or three months balanced 
against 24 years is -- it's not as though we think documents 
will go missing in those three months that weren't already 
somehow lost to the winds of time over the last 24 years, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  So you are -- I will just note, by the
way, that in your initial letter you ask for an opportunity to
do full briefing, but it is all laid out in the letters.  So
let me just get some clarification on that.  What more briefing
would you be looking to do beyond what's in these letters?  You
have case citations in these letters and you lay out the bases
for a stay.  What would you be looking to do when you are
trying to conserve resources?  Do you really need full
briefing.
MS. MENNINGER:  I think it could be abbreviated
briefing; but, yes, there are more cases in support of the
request that we are making.  There are more cases in terms of
the criminal investigation versus active prosecution, and then
there is certainly a fair amount of exhibits that I could
tender to your Honor to display the breadth of discovery that
is part of the traditional balancing test when looking at a
motion to stay -- or good cause -- of grounds for good cause as
balanced against the breadth of discovery.

this call I asked if my law clerk Hanna Martin was on.  Hanna,
are you there?
MS. MARTIN:  Yes, I'm here, Judge.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, for the court reporter, it is
Hanna Martin, H-A-N-N-A.
And Hanna and I were conferring before this conference
about some case law about some criminal prosecution as opposed
to criminal investigation, and we weren't finding, at least on
an initial look, cases where the courts tended to stay civil
proceedings when there was an investigation proceeding.  You
have cases that say the opposite?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I have some.  They are not
in the Southern District, so there are -- 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MS. MENNINGER:  -- cases that have occurred in various
federal and state cases across the country.
THE COURT:  And you are looking for a stay of the
entire case, not just as to proceedings against your client?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, it seems to me best to
stay the case, but I would be amenable just in regards to my
client or, as I said towards the end of my letter, there are
other alternatives that, you know, I think I would view as
intermediate steps, for example, bifurcation of discovery on
the statute of limitations issue, for example, if that were
something the court thought were appropriate or a stay on party

depositions until later in the discovery process to see where
the claims program and the criminal investigation end up, and
certainly with regard to the motion to dismiss, that should be,
I would think, decided at some point.
THE COURT:  I might consider, because there is a lot
to do in this case, I might consider putting a hold on
Ms. Maxwell having to make statements, so either responding to
substantive interrogatories or being deposed because of Fifth
Amendment issues, because it may be that she ends up the
subject of prosecution even if she is not yet and because there
are other things that can meanwhile be going forward.  If we
put her deposition further down the pike, maybe we will have
greater clarity on that before that issue actually comes to the
fore.
I'm also thinking that there are other interests 
besides hers in this case.  There are plaintiffs' interests and 
I'm sure that although your point is well taken that it's not 
that likely that documents will now not be preserved within 
these few months as opposed to not being preserved over the 
years, I'm sure plaintiff does not want to hear that after all 
of these years she must wait more time in order to have what 
she considers to be serious wrongs redressed.  So the factors 
can cut in more than one direction. 
So right now I'm not inclined to stay the whole case,
but I am inclined to keep one eye on settlement, to keep one

eye -- I'm not sure how many eyes I have -- to keep an eye on
the -- any criminal investigation and ask to have updates if
there are charges filed, and maybe put some things more at the
front end of the discovery period, some things more at the back
end of the discovery period.  And I am willing to move the
dates out some to accommodate the parties if the parties are
engaged in good-faith discussions, if there is a desire to
conserve resources because it looks like the claims program is
in fact going forward.  I am willing to do that.  I have done
that another cases.  I have stayed other cases.  I have
extended deadlines in other cases.  I don't really want to see
resources going to litigation if it's not necessary.  But right
now I'm not inclined to have a complete stay of everything.
Ms. Menninger, what would be your reaction to saying
hold off on anything that could be in the category of
affirmative statements made by Ms. Maxwell for now and having
other discovery going forward?
MS. MENNINGER:  It does address -- this is
Ms. Menninger, again, Laura Menninger.  
It does address many of my concerns.  I would say, you 
know, the costs related to the broad discovery demands that 
were propounded, written discovery requests and the like, are 
still of concern to me.  As I mentioned, we have been asked for 
every calendar she has had for the last 24 years and every 
Amazon account she has ever used for the last 24 years.  So

I -- 
THE COURT:  That sounds to me, again, like you need to
have a discussion with plaintiffs' counsel and, plaintiffs'
counsel, it sounds like you need to have a discussion with
Ms. Menninger about what you really need, why you really need
it, how it can be done in a way that's manageable with no
absolute yeses and no absolute nos with respect to those sorts
of requests.
It may be that there is something about Amazon
accounts that's really critical, and you can explain that.  And
maybe there is something else that's not really critical, and
you can, you know, bend a bit on it.  So you need to have that
kind of discussion to keep, you know -- you know, to keep
discovery tailored to the case and proportionate to the needs
of the case.  That has to do with time frame, that has to do
with the scope of what's being claimed in a particular case,
and to some extent it has to do with Mr. Epstein's accused
conduct over time.  So you are going to have to try to have
that conversation and try to balance it.  And if you can't,
then I will.
MS. MENNINGER:  I appreciate that, your Honor.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is --

THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Please go ahead.
MS. McCAWLEY:  With respect to the motion to stay that
Ms. Maxwell is proposing, one of the bases that she has filed
motion to dismiss, Judge Schofield held a premotion conference
with respect to that --
THE COURT:  Hold on a moment, please.  Do I still
have -- do I still have -- I know I still have Ms. McCawley.
Do I still have Ms. Menninger?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do I still have Mr. Moskowitz?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Did anyone join us who is another
attorney?  Okay.  Hopefully we didn't lose anybody.  If anyone
joined from the public or press, welcome.  Please keep your
phone on mute.  
Okay.  Go ahead.  You were saying, Ms. McCawley? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  So we did hold in front of 
Judge Schofield a premotion conference on Ms. Maxwell's motion
to dismiss.  As Judge Schofield did with the estate, she
discouraged Ms. Maxwell from filing a motion to dismiss, giving
her preliminary views that they -- the arguments that she was
putting forth were not meritorious.  Ms. Maxwell insisted on
filing a motion to dismiss and has done that now, just this

K5m2FarC                  
week.  So in my view, that is -- bodes against any sort of stay
based on the motion to dismiss because the district judge has
set forth her views with respect to that at least as an initial
matter.
With respect to the case law, your Honor is correct,
the case law in New York is clear that unless there is an
indictment put forward, which there has not been, it doesn't
allow somebody in a civil case to stay the case on the basis of
a possible investigation.
With respect to your Honor's statements about the
investigation and potentially allowing Ms. Maxwell to not have
to make statements in this civil action, the concern I have
there is that we have no indication of any time frame with
respect to the Southern District of New York, how long that
investigation could go on or will go on or anything of that
nature.  So the concern, for me, is Ms. Maxwell, as we have
alleged, worked in concert with Mr. Epstein to abuse my client.
We brought those claims under the Child Victims Act, as we are
allowed to do, because she was a minor, and to not be able to
get a discovery and ask Ms. Maxwell questions and get responses
and keep the case moving forward puts us in handcuffs with
respect to being able to establish our claims because, as your
Honor has seen from the complaint, the allegations are that
they worked together hand in hand with respect to the abuse of
Annie Farmer.  So I would have concerns about some form of that

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
kind of a path for defendant Maxwell in the case at this time
until there is a criminal indictment that's put forward.
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me just say a few things
about that.
First of all, if the investigation is going on here in 
New York, or for that matter wherever it may be going on, 
because what we have in New York is not only in New York with 
respect to COVID-19, the grand jury process is understandably 
delayed because it is very difficult to have jurors convene.  
So there may be additional time before any case that is being 
investigated is indicted, and so we just have to recognize that 
we are in somewhat unusual circumstances. 
The second thing is that any stay that I might put in
place with respect to any aspect of the claims against
Ms. Maxwell would be temporary and would be revisited.  I would
not allow it to drag on indefinitely.  But in a case where some
things can be done to move the case forward and the case is not
completely stalled, I don't see any harm in putting some things
a little bit further down the road.
The third thing I will say is this is also an unusual
circumstance because of the potential of this claims process in
which plaintiff may well participate and which may well get off
the ground soon; and, if it does, I'm not sure whether it would
moot claims against Ms. Maxwell or not, but it might.  And as
you balance those factors, you have this situation where we may

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
know in the relatively near future whether plaintiff is
actively participating in the claims process, whether it looks
like it is going to resolve her claims, and we may never have
to get to the point where we jeopardize, potentially jeopardize
somebody's Fifth Amendment rights.
So I might be inclined to do this, to say, look, you 
can carry on with discovery in the case after a conference on 
all kinds of things, to try to keep costs under control and try 
to focus on what's most important.  I will extend deadlines out 
if you would like if you are feeling pressure from that.  We 
will hold off on -- not on production of documents from 
Ms. Maxwell but on the statements that she makes, whether sworn 
statements or interrogatories or deposition, we will put that a 
little bit further down.  You will give me status report 
regarding the process of settlement, and we will take stock.   
And with respect to holding off on interrogatory 
responses or deposition by Ms. Maxwell, that will not be a 
permanent situation, that will be revisited.  And if time is 
stretching out too far and if there is no indictment, then I 
may take further briefing on the subject and I will make a 
decision as to whether in fact that part of the case should 
also go forward.  But I will not let it drag out indefinitely.  
That is my current thinking. 
What say both of you on that?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger.

K5m2FarC                  
That would be -- we would welcome that ruling, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Plaintiff?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, obviously we disagree with
that because we believe that it's important to have
Ms. Maxwell's participation in this case.  We have noticed her
for a deposition already and that got moved because she -- you
know, the issue of just being able to be in person, things of
that nature.  We were trying to accommodate.  So we are
concerned about there being extended delay and are concerned
about not being able to get information from her through her
testimony.
We respect the court's concerns about a Fifth 
Amendment privilege but, again, we would ask that if you are 
going to be inclined to do something like this, you tie it to a 
date like the June 15 date, or something along those lines, so 
that we are not in a position where she is able to take 
depositions of all of our people and we are, you know, 
handcuffed with respect to any discovery with respect to 
Ms. Maxwell. 
THE COURT:  Like I said, I have no desire to have this
drag out.  If all things -- if we didn't have this potential
claim process out there with a fairly soon, seemingly likely,
start date, according to defendants, then I think the balance
would be different.  Because I don't think the case law in this
circuit would generally support the stay when there is no

prosecution pending yet.
But nonetheless, there are a number of factors one 
might look at on that, and whether or not an indictment is 
pending is only one of the factors.  There are several factors 
that could be relevant, including, and I'm going to refer you 
to the Louis Vuitton Malletier case.  For the court reporter, 
L-O-U-I-S V-U-I-T-T-O-N M-A-L-L-E-T-I-E-R v. Ly, L-Y, U.S.A., 
Inc., and the case number is 676 F.3d 83 from 2011.  So the 
Second Circuit noted that courts often take a look at a number 
of factors in deciding whether there should be a stay, 
including the extent to which the issues in the criminal case 
overlap with those presented in the civil case.  Here, there 
would be, I assume, a very strong overlap to the status of the 
case, including whether the defendants have been indicted.  So 
that's a factor.   
Three, the private interests of the plaintiff in 
proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to 
plaintiffs caused by the delay.  Here I'm looking at the 
potential settlement process and that, to me, is an unusual 
factor that suggests that the plaintiffs' interests may be 
divided here in proceeding fast with this case when there is a 
potential settlement within the next few months potentially 
available to plaintiffs and plaintiff may go for that.   
Another factor is the private interest of and burden 
on the defendants.  We do have an individual here.  We are not

talking about the estate, and there is somewhat more burden for 
discovery.   
There are the interests of the courts.  The interest 
of the court is not to have unnecessary litigation if the 
matters can be resolved amicably, and not to have it stretch 
out forever.  That's also an interest of the court.   
We also have this strange overlay of COVID-19 which 
affects the ability for criminal prosecutors to take matters to 
a grand jury.   
The public interest, I think the public interest is -- 
would be well served by a claims process.  If you look at this 
case in terms of there being a number of claim victims, and 
that is something that I definitely am looking at and is 
weighing into my consideration as to how any and all of these 
cases should be litigated.  And in several of the cases, which 
claims that are no more recent than the claims here, a lot of 
plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to stays or partial stays or 
are holding off on certain things to conserve resources and 
allow that process to play out a bit, and I think that those 
are factors that are unusual in this case.  This is a 
case-by-case, specific analysis that has to be made as to 
whether there should be a stay. 
So in this particular case, at this particular time,
with these particular circumstances, it seems to me to make
sense not to stay the case in its entirety, to send counsel

off to have the kind of good-faith conference you should have
had before contacting me in the first place and that you should
always have about anything and everything as you try to work
through discovery issues, but to hold off on the most serious
of the issues with respect to Ms. Maxwell, which are her
constitutional rights, and not forever, but at least long
enough to let us know whether the claims process is likely to
go forward.  And I will revisit it, and I will revisit it at
intervals that are reasonable and that does not put you in
limbo where you will never be able to get discovery from
Ms. Maxwell if this case proceeds.  All right?
So let me ask straight out, are you, under the 
circumstances I have described and the way in which I would 
envision this, which is some discovery going forward, 
good-faith conference, report to me by June 19 about the 
status, are you looking to have me move out the discovery 
schedules at all and, if so, by how long? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley.  
Would it be possible to have some time to consider 
that?  Right now the discovery deadline is set for July 10, I 
believe, and I of course have anticipated taking depositions 
throughout June and into early July.  So if I could have some 
time to consider what that would look like and confer with the 
other side, then if we can't agree, then maybe present 
something to the court with the timing of that?

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not usually in the
habit of suggesting extensions, but I think here, rather than
be crunched with depositions and panicking at the end of June
and beginning of July, putting another 30 days on it to give
you time to talk through your issues and for me to have fuller
briefing on the issue of a stay, should it come to that, it
might make sense to at least give you another 30.
MS. McCAWLEY:  That would be fine, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Moskowitz, do you want to say
anything?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Just very quickly, your Honor.  
That 30-day initial extension for the further 
discussion makes perfect sense to us.  I would say you laid 
out -- your Honor laid out very compelling reasons, one of 
which is unique to this action, but the others equally apply to 
the other actions that we are here now before you on, so I 
would hope that we could also discuss with Ms. McCawley keeping 
the extensions in line for each case with those other 
considerations in mind.  It's something we will discuss.   
The only other thing I wanted to mention is -- which I 
didn't get a chance to mention earlier is that Ms. McCawley 
mentioned various concerns about the program.  That could be 
more convincing from someone but for the fact that they already 
stayed one of their clients' actions in favor of the program.  
So I just don't -- it doesn't square with us that those

concerns are such that they can't take the same reasoned 
approach in the other actions when they found it reasonable for 
one of them already.   
But other than that, I have nothing to add, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I'm going to ask for a status
report by June 19.  In that status report, I not only want to
hear about how discovery is going and how settlement prospects
are looking.  I also want to hear about further discussions
with counsel for Ms. Maxwell and mapping out of how the parties
would anticipate things moving further from that point, and,
you know, Ms. Maxwell permitting not to respond to
interrogatories and not to have her deposition until the
parties have had a chance to confer, until I have had that
status report June 19, until I hear again from counsel as to
the next logical way to proceed with that, and I will kick out
discovery deadlines 30 days, which is modest.  Others, I think,
are going to be kicked out longer.  You can do whatever
planning you do for depositions to be happening a little
further down the road in July, and you will get back to me.  As
need be, we will have another conference and we will take in
the next piece.  Okay?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Anything else -- 
MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT:  -- before we end this call?
All right.  Let me just say one last thing, which is, 
I did record this call into the conferencing system, but you 
also have a court reporter on the call.  You don't need to have 
a transcript made from the telephone recording.  And just be 
aware that if there are two transcripts made -- one from AT&T 
and one from the court reporter -- and there is any 
discrepancy, the court reporter's transcript will be the 
official transcript and will control.  Okay? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you all.  Take care,
everybody.
