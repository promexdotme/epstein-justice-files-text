RELIEF REQUESTED 
Relator/ Intervenor requests seizure of the politically corrupt organization USDOJ; associated 
with abuses of prosecutorial discretion, fraud, and public corruption. Intervenor has witnessed the 
same pattern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his own case; and has now identified the same 
conspiracy at work in this case. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
• 
Intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2012/2013, 
Intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with the Washington State Auditor's Office. The 
complaint was escalated to Michael Horowitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A 
Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the 
complaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges 
that Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered 
that State of Washington concealed this information so that "Democrats" and Republicans could 
launder $70 billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through 
intervenor's attorneyz. 
• 
On 12/27 / 19, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the 
False Claims Act, seeking $1 billion in damages and qui tam bounty against "Democrats", 
Republicans, and his former attorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby 
attached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)). 
• 
On 5/1/13, USDOJ submitted a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor's claim (See EXHIBIT C Case 
1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor's allegations 
"lack sufficient factual and legal support." 
• 
On 5/13/19, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ attorneys 
for conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby 
attached by Declaration). 
• 
On 5/14/19, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct., 
after fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case 1:19-CR-
00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration).

• 
On 5/15/19, Intervenor had his petition for quo warranto against USDOJ for fraud/ obstruction/ 
perjury dismissed as "moot" (See EXHIBIT F Case l:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by 
Deel a ration). 
• 
On 6/6/19, Intervenor identified the conspiracy (the same conspiracy at work in this case) to the 
District Ct. (Freemasonry/ Rotary; See EXHIBITS G and H (EXHIBIT H affidavit 1112-17) Case 1:19-CR-
00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration). The conspiracy is subject to the unequal application of 
the laws; and the conspiracy monopolizes the judiciary. 
• 
On 6/26/19, the District Court refused to vacate its decision, and threatened Intervenor with 
sanctions if Relater appealed the decision (See EXHIBIT I Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached 
by Declaration). Relater appealed. 
• 
On 7 /27 /19, Intervenor sent USDOJ attorneyz the 9th Circuit mediation form (See EXHIBIT J Case 
1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), showing the course of action Intervenor 
intended to pursue on appeal. Intervenor also indicated that he intended to write about USDOJ's 
unlimited "prosecutorial discretion" to fraudulently dismiss False Claims complaints, as this 
"prosecutorial discretion" was the same "prosecutorial discretion" exercised by USDOJ and Alex 
Acosta in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Intervenor also attached an article by the former Deputy 
Attorney General of the United States (Donald Ayer), indicating that Barr was a "fierce advocate of 
unchecked presidential power''. Intervenor also identified the judge in the District Ct. (formerly 
presiding over Intervenor's case), as being associated with the conspiracy. 
• 
According to newspaper reports, on 7 /29/19, Jeffrey Epstein was taken off suicide watch. 
• 
According to newspaper reports, on 8/10/19, Epstein was found dead. 
ARGUMENT 
Intervention in criminal matters "have been granted in limited circumstances where 'a third party's 
constitutional or other federal rights are implicated by the resolution of a particular motion, request, or 
other issue during the course of a criminal case.
111 United States v. Col/yard, case no. 12cr0058, 2013 
WL1346202 at *2 (D. Minn. April 3, 2013 quoting United States v. Carmichael, 342 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 
1072 (M.D. Ala 2004). 
Here, just 3 months prior, Relater filed a petition of quo warranto against Bill Barr/ USDOJ for fraud, 
perjury, and treason. The judge in the District Ct. denied Relater (and the People) the right to quo 
warranto, and dismissed Relator's complaint to "moot" the quo warranto proceedings (Relater is 
entitled to this right under the 9th/10th Arndt.). Further, Relater has been denied constitutional and 
other legal rights as provided for under the pt, 41\ 5th, and 14th amendments, the Crime Victims Act,

and the substantial law. Intervenor has been denied these rights so that the conspiracy can continue 
laundering tax money. Intervenor has already proven that USDOJ/ OIG are politically corrupt federal 
agencies, as intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with WA State Auditor and OIG in 2012/2013 
because he was worried about structural bridge collapse. As a result of filing this complaint, intervenor 
had his career and reputation destroyed by OIG, State of WA, and his attorneyz. Relator has already 
shown that OIG/ USDOJ agencies cannot be trusted as they specialize in fraud and deception (see 
complaint No CV 18-6051 on Pacer for the entire complaint). 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, and the fact that USDOJ and OIG have already been proven by relator to be 
politically corrupt agencies, G. respectfully requests that the Court approve his motion, and surrender 
USDOJ to relator. 
The obstruction of the quo warranto proceedings and the "apparent acquittal" for USDOJ, has resulted 
in the "apparent suicide" of Jeffrey Epstein while under USDOJ / Bill Barr watch. Relator has already 
demonstrated/ proven that USDOJ/ OIG are corrupt and assisting Republicans and "Democrats" to 
launder tax money. Intervenor's motion should be granted.
